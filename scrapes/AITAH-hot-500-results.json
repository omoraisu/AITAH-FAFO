      "selftext": "Hi Reddit, I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for about three years. I\u2019m really into crafting and love reusing things most people would throw away, like empty bottles or soda tabs. Over time, my boyfriend\u2019s family started saving things for me, like old cans or random scraps, and honestly, I thought it was super sweet. I\u2019ve always appreciated that they thought of me.\n\nBut here\u2019s where things got kind of... weird. My birthday is super close to my boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s (28F), like only five days apart, so we had a joint birthday party last year. As gifts, they gave me a bag full of \u201ccraft supplies,\u201d like soda tabs, empty bottles, and some random other bits and bobs. I mean, it was thoughtful in a way, but then his sister got these super nice gifts, like a pandora charm bracelet and an apple watch. I felt a little embarrassed to be honest, but I kept smiling and thanked them because I really do appreciate gifts in general. My boyfriend noticed, though, and he got really upset\u2014he even wanted to call them out, but I told him to let it go and not cause drama.\n\nThen last christmas happened. A few days before, I\u2019d hurt my wrists at the gym (nothing major, just a scrape and some bandages), but I hadn\u2019t told his family about it since I hadn\u2019t seen them. Only my family and my boyfriend knew what actually happened.\n\nSo christmas morning comes, and we\u2019re all opening presents together. His family gave everyone else these *amazing* gifts\u2014new shoes, jewelry, an iphone, gift cards worth like hundreds of dollars. When I opened mine, I got\u2026 an empty soda bottle, some used (and dirty) aluminum foil, and a handful of soda tabs. That was it.\n\nLook, I\u2019m all about crafting, but this felt kinda insulting. My boyfriend was fuming, but we decided to keep quiet for now. Then his family asked me, all smiling, \u201cdo you like your gifts?\u201d\n\nI just\u2026 snapped. I smiled back and said, \u201coh thank you so much! I really appreciate it. But unfortunately, I won\u2019t be able to use them anymore because of my accident.\u201d They looked confused, so I explained (very seriously) that my injury was worse than it looked and that both my hands would have to be amputated. My boyfriend nodded with a straight face and added that we hadn\u2019t told anyone yet because it was a really emotional situation for me.\n\nTheir faces went WHITE. They started apologizing, saying they had no idea and how awful they felt. A few of them even looked like they might cry. I just nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m used to it by now,\u201d and left it at that. We left shortly after.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing\u2014my hands are totally fine. It was just a couple of scrapes, but I was so hurt and angry about the \u201cgifts\u201d that I wanted them to realize how thoughtless they were being. My boyfriend thinks I was justified, but later his sister texted me saying I was cruel for \u201cmaking a scene\u201d and guilt tripping the whole family on xmas (ig the word got to her that my hands are fine).\n\nSo now I\u2019m starting to feel a little bad. Did I go too far? AITA?",

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, just a quick update.\n\nI appreciate all the comments and the different opinions on my previous post, however at the end of the day, the reason I posted it was because I felt guilty about what I did, and I agreed more with the comments stating what I did was wrong. Also my sister has never once given me bad advice in life, and I think her assessment was right this time too. \n\nSince I left Ana at the restaurant last week, she texted me a couple of times, but I just ignored those messages. I opened the messages a couple hours ago, and I was sort of surprised. Instead of lashing out at me, she just apologised again and said she was willing to stop seeing Josh if it meant we could continue our relationship. She said after the dinner, she just took an Uber back home and didn\u2019t go to Josh\u2019s.\n\nI texted Ana that there was no reason to apologise and I shouldn\u2019t have left her stranded at the restaurant and I should have also paid for her meal, since I was the one who invited her to the expensive restaurant. I asked Ana for her Venmo but Ana said she didn\u2019t care about the money and asked if we could continue our relationship. However, I didn\u2019t have the same feelings for Ana anymore so just I texted Ana upfront that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re compatible, and I don\u2019t want to continue this. We chatted a bit more, and Ana was very respectful of my decision, but admitted she was sad. I too admitted it was tough, but it\u2019s best for everyone that this doesn\u2019t continue further. \n\nThat was the final text and I definitely think there are valuable lessons learnt from this entire thing. Thank you all for your input.",

      "selftext": "This has been the most traumatic year of my life, and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m being too harsh or if I\u2019m justified in my choices. I (F35) was married to my husband (M42) for eight years. We have two kids together a son (9) and a daughter (7). I thought our life was stable and happy until everything unraveled seven months ago.\n\nI found out that my husband was cheating on me with my younger sister (24). I didn\u2019t discover it through subtle clues or intuition. My son overheard an inappropriate conversation between the two of them at a family gathering and came to me, confused and upset. When I confronted my husband, he denied it at first, but eventually admitted to the affair.\n\nI was utterly shattered. But what made it even worse was that my mom sided with my husband and sister. She defended their actions, saying, \u201cYour sister is young and doesn\u2019t know any better,\u201d and, \u201cYour husband must have felt neglected to fall for someone else.\u201d Then she had the audacity to suggest I forgive them and \u201ckeep the family together for the kids.\u201d I was stunned and disgusted.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, was furious. He called out my mom\u2019s behavior, told her she was enabling betrayal, and eventually filed for divorce from her because he couldn\u2019t tolerate her lack of morals. He\u2019s been one of my few sources of support throughout all of this.\n\nI filed for divorce immediately and cut off my mom and sister completely. My kids have been struggling with the fallout. My son is especially angry and has told me he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with his dad. My daughter is quieter but has been acting out in small ways. We\u2019ve been going to therapy together, and I\u2019ve been doing everything I can to help them navigate this while also trying to heal myself.\n\nOver the past few months, I\u2019ve started putting my life back together. I\u2019ve focused on my kids, leaned on my dad and close friends for support, and even started dating someone new (F36). She\u2019s been incredible\u2014kind, understanding, and supportive. She\u2019s great with my kids, and they\u2019ve grown to love her, which makes me feel like I can finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nBut the chaos isn\u2019t over. My sister\u2019s relationship with my ex-husband has completely fallen apart (shocking, right?). Now she\u2019s blaming my mom, saying she encouraged the whole thing. My mom, meanwhile, is blowing up my phone, accusing me of tearing the family apart by refusing to forgive them. She says my new relationship is \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to our family and claims I\u2019m being selfish for not letting her or my sister back into my life.\n\nTo top it off, my ex-husband has been reaching out, begging for forgiveness and asking for a second chance. He\u2019s telling me it was all a mistake and that he misses me and the kids. My son and daughter both want nothing to do with him, but I\u2019m conflicted about how much of a relationship (if any) they should have with their father.\n\nMy dad and friends say I\u2019m doing the right thing by cutting out toxic people and focusing on rebuilding my life. But the guilt-tripping from my mom and sister is starting to wear me down, and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m being too harsh. Should I try to reconcile with my mom and sister for the sake of family? Should I give my ex more of a chance to be involved for the sake of the kids?\n\nAITA for divorcing my husband, cutting off my mom and sister, and moving forward with my life and new relationship?\n\nedit: i have changed my number and i\u2019m currently moving, no i don\u2019t speak to any of my ex husband\u2019s family and apparently the snitch was my aunt and her husband (are we shocked?) so i\u2019m officially not speaking to them. And for the people complaining about the fact my kids know my girlfriend so what? my children adore her, also for the custody. It\u2019s 60-40, meaning i can choose which schedule the kids can have with their father since i\u2019m the primary. No i\u2019m not forcing my kids to not speak to their dad, they\u2019ve told me numerous times that they don\u2019t like going to my ex husband\u2019s house and i respect that, i\u2019m currently going for full custody. For the people telling me to get a restraining order, my lawyer said they haven\u2019t done anything to endanger my children and I so i legally can\u2019t get one. My dad also has some suspicions that my mom cheated on him with how she was defending the affair.",

Over the years, I\u2019ve turned one of the rooms in my house into a \"toy room,\" which is essentially my personal space filled with collectibles, intricate LEGO models, and a few rare items I\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money acquiring.\n\nMy sister (38F) has three kids: 9F, 7M, and 5M. She\u2019s always known I\u2019m into this stuff and never seemed to care until recently when her family came over for a visit. Her youngest son (5M) saw the room while I was showing my brother-in-law around the house and immediately got excited. He asked if he could go in and play.\n\nI gently told him that the room wasn\u2019t for playing, and I\u2019d be happy to set up some toys he could use in the living room instead. This didn\u2019t go over well with my sister. She said I was being ridiculous and that I should let the kids \"be kids\" and enjoy themselves. I stood firm and explained that many of the items in that room were fragile, expensive, or had sentimental value.\n\nHer kids were disappointed, and she accused me of being \"selfish\" and \"not understanding how to be part of a family.\" She\u2019s since brought it up multiple times, saying I\u2019m \"hoarding toys from actual children\" and making her feel unwelcome.\n\nTo be clear, I love my niece and nephews. I\u2019ve always gotten them gifts for their birthdays and played with them when they visit. But I see my collection as more of a hobby or an art display than something for kids to handle. It\u2019s not like I have a house full of toys and I\u2019m refusing to share\u2014it\u2019s one dedicated room that I\u2019ve spent years building up.\n\nMy parents are split on the issue. My mom thinks I could\u2019ve \"compromised\" by supervising the kids in the room, but my dad sides with me, saying it\u2019s my house and my rules.

      "selftext": "I\u2019m (24, F) getting married to my fianc\u00e9 (28, M) in a few months, and I\u2019m in the middle of planning everything. I love my sister, Emily (30, F), and we\u2019ve always been close despite our differences. She has three kids (ages 5, 7, and 10), and while I love them, I don\u2019t see them often. The problem is that the last time they visited my house, they left behind a trail of chaos that\u2019s made me question whether I want them at my wedding.\n\nA few months ago, Emily and her kids came to visit for the weekend. I was excited to spend time with them, but as soon as they walked in, things went sideways. They ran through my house, broke a vase, spilled juice on the carpet, and drew on my walls with crayon. I know kids can be messy, but this felt different. When Emily tried to help, the kids ignored her and were more interested in playing. The worst part was when my fianc\u00e9 found one of the kids trying to climb on our dining table, which was a custom piece we saved up for.\n\nWhen they left, my house was in shambles. It took me two days to clean everything up, and I was left feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. I brought it up to Emily, and she said, \u201cKids will be kids,\u201d and that I shouldn\u2019t be so hard on them. I understand kids can be energetic and curious, but it felt like my boundaries were crossed, and my home wasn\u2019t respected.\n\nNow, as I\u2019m planning my wedding, Emily has asked if she and the kids can come. She told me that her kids are excited to see me get married and that they would be on their best behavior. I wanted to say yes, but I can\u2019t forget how they treated my house. I\u2019ve been stressing about it, and I finally told her that I\u2019m not comfortable having them at the wedding. I offered to let her come with her husband or a friend, but she\u2019s upset and says I\u2019m being unreasonable and unfair.\n\nSome of my friends have said I should let it go and let them come. Others say I have every right to set boundaries for my big day. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m overreacting or if I\u2019m justified in saying no.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to let my sister\u2019s kids attend my wedding after the chaos they caused at my house?",

      "selftext": "I (50F) am a newly divorced single mom who was left by my ex, after 27 years of marriage, after his mistress became pregnant.\n\nI have a 17 year old daughter and a 26 year old daughter. My 26 year old lives abroad.\n\nMy ex husband was physically and verbally abusive our entire marriage. The physical abuse began in earnest in our mid twenties and reached a peak in our early thirties.\n\nI only have a HS diploma. I originally wanted to go to college after marriage but my ex's abuse had me paralyzed to do anything he labeled as opposing/ undermining him and our family ( which included education and work).\n\nI tried to leave many times from around age 26 to 33 when the physical abuse was the worst but he'd find me. He'd alternate between gifts and apologies and threats. He also involved our bishop who sided with him.\n\nHe would go through our trash and once found a pamphlet for a community college program and the ensuing rage nearly landed me in the hospital. He'd call 5 times a day when he was at work and would often hit me if I missed a call accusing me of cheating or job hunting.\n\nMid 30s his physical abuse died down a bit but the verbal abuse and controlling fixation ( where he'd constantly be paranoid and call me a liar, sneaky, undermining) remained until our late forties when he began ignoring me completely. I was so broken down at that point that I was an emotional robot with I no interests, enjoyment of life, aspirations.\n\nThat's when he started calling me dumb, boring, empty. He even said he'd prefer a liar and underminer over what I was now and left me for his pregnant mistress who later called the cops on him for hitting her but declined to press charges.\n\nMy ex wasn't a big earner and spent a lot keeping up appearances so I got around $7,000 in the divorce.\n\nI understand many would be thankful for what I got. I got a job after 2 months making $14/hr but my boss said he can't schedule me full time- take it or leave it.\n\nBut I'm concerned about my retirement because all I want is to be able to retire in my seventies with consistent food and shelter since I'm already having health issues. So I asked my 17 yo who took a personal finance elective to help me read through some information I found online about retirement savings.\n\nThe other day my phone was dead and I needed to look something up so I used my daughter's phone. I found a group chat where my daughter was asking her friends who were in the class for advice and they were saying \" I don't know, sounds tough\" or saying I should apply for hospital jobs. She then wrote \" I know my mom is an example of what not to do but help please.\" She also aired laundry about how her new stepmother was like a mini version of me and doesn't understand why people like her dad \" get off\" on the fighting and his new wife opposing him which leads to him tearing her down and then making up with her. She also claims that I was thrown to the side by my ex because he got bored of me being what he wanted and a classmate said maybe her dad likes the fighting because he knows he'll win and feel like a champion.\n\nI just feel it was so disrespectful since I've told her about the abuse yet she doesn't understand the toll it takes on you. I didn't need her airing out my dirty laundry. Her response was she cut her dad off so she does understand and was trying to help. I took her phone for the afternoon saying maybe she'll think twice criticizing my choices to her friends. AITA?",

My brothers and I were raised in a jacked up house with a religious nut job of a Mom. It was so ridiculous that we were not even allowed to go swimming at the pool. We were taught that ANYTHING sexual not related to procreation with your spouse was wrong. The funniest shit ever was when she would see a woman showing cleavage. \n\nMy wife and I are somewhat recently married, and we\u2019re a blended family with three teenage boys\u2014two hers and one mine. We\u2019ve created a sex-positive household where body confidence and self-expression are valued. My wife is very comfortable in her own skin and sometimes wears revealing clothing around the house\u2014like booty shorts or similar outfits. It\u2019s something we\u2019re both okay with and aligns with how we want to live in our home.\n\nRecently, my brother came over unannounced and made a comment about how \u201cinappropriate\u201d my wife\u2019s attire was. He said it made him uncomfortable and suggested that, with three teenage boys in the house, she should be more mindful of what she wears. I told him this is our home, not his, and that if he has a problem with what she wears, he doesn\u2019t need to come over. When he doubled down, I got frustrated and told him to \u201cscrew off.\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s upset and accusing me of being disrespectful to him, saying I\u2019m prioritizing my wife\u2019s choices over \u201cbasic decency\u201d for guests and setting a bad example for the kids. Some family members have chimed in, saying I could\u2019ve handled it better or that maybe my brother has a point about how it could affect the boys.\n\nFrom my perspective, my wife isn\u2019t doing anything wrong. The boys are being raised to respect boundaries and understand body positivity. If my brother doesn\u2019t like it, I feel like that\u2019s his problem\u2014not ours.\n\nSo, AITAH for defending my wife and telling my brother to screw off instead of addressing his concerns more calmly?",

His siblings were given cars, his parents took out 2 reverse mortgages on his older siblings, maxed credit cards and still have 14k in debt). I have been under a lot of stress taking my inlaws to appointments,ft caregiving, kids to school, house, grounds maintenance etc. I normally get up at 3am to start the day. Recently, I finally snapped(I was just tired and needed a break. My husbands siblings have not helped with his parents at all) and my husband responded that day with \"Why are you always so angry?\" I had stopped washing the dishes. My MIL was in ear shot of this. I got up, got dressed, gave my kiddos a kiss each. Told them I loved them and drove over to my friends house for a good cry out of frustration. She let me in allowed me to take the time to decompress and I went home .\n A few weeks later my husband came up to me and said his mother asked him when I left,\" You don't think she's having an affair? Do you?\". This took me completely off guard. Here I am sacrificing my time to care for her and her husband, and that's the first thing that crosses her mind? Not the lack of support from her kids but that! I told my husband that I refused to help her and would no longer be her caregiver. The one thing I've never wavered on is my stance on being faithful. So, WIBTA, in refusing to take care of my MIL after this? \n\nEdit: For those of you asking about my husband. He shot my MIL down real quick when she mentioned it. We have an open communication, thus why he told me about his mothers response. He's on my side when it concerns his mother. We are currently talking about accommodations for my inlaws over coffee. As for my parents my mother left my siblings after my father's passing of leukemia. My sister became their guardian. My father passed away when I was 17. He was taken care of by my siblings and myself until his passing. \nBack story:They had to sell their home 2 yrs ago due to them not being financially in debt(over 30k in debt prior). I agreed they could stay at the time as I had a good relationship with my inlaws. Recently, my FIL was admitted into the hospital, then rehab, now home with us. He is legally blind and has multiple health problems. I was a caregiver for many years(10+ with dementia), so I don't mind my FIL in the least. He doesn't bother me and does his own thing. \n\nUpdate#1: \nI had a nice long chat with my husband today. I took some of your guys' advice on things. I talked to him about his siblings getting involved. He said they won't make an effort. To which my response was neither will I. If they won't give them their time, they can pay for their care(his siblings all make decent money but are terrible holding onto it). As for living arrangements, he has until the new years to find accommodations for them. Or I will find some for my kids and myself.(This got his attention the most as I'm not one to go back on my word). I sacrificed enough and am currently looking at jobs. I haven't had one as I was a SAHM for many years(6). My husband was the breadwinner, and I was glad to be home with my twins at the time. I will update you all come new years. ",

He was literally laying in the sun asleep and she kept watching him with this wide eyed scared expression. Eva asked if she was okay. Sarah asked me if I minded putting Baja in his crate. I told her he didn\u2019t have one because if I leave the house for long periods he\u2019s with me. She then started ranting about how irresponsible that was, that he could hurt people from being left out, that he was violent and obviously dangerous, and that he would probably attack strangers on the street. I told her none of those things were true and he\u2019s my dog and this is how I choose to care for him. She said she had a phobia of big dogs and couldn\u2019t function with him around. I told her that maybe they she should hang at my sister\u2019s place instead because she was so scared. Sarah was offended but she didn\u2019t say anything just gave me a dirty look then Eva a look. Eva was trying to convince Sarah that he couldn\u2019t get in without my unlocking it but she was convinced that Baja was waiting outside to kill her. I told them I was gonna take him on a walk and they left shortly after.\n\nThe next day when I was at my moms, Eva jumped down my throat about invalidating Sarah. She said I could\u2019ve locked Baja in my room or something because Sarah has a phobia of dogs. I told her that Baja lived there and they didn\u2019t and if they didn\u2019t like it they didn\u2019t have to come back. My mom said it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to lock him away for a few hours and that I could\u2019ve been more sensitive. I left shortly after because honestly they can complain all they want. I\u2019m not locking my dog in a room when he was secured in his area. So AITA?\n",

      "selftext": "I (35F) and my stepdaughter (R, 19F) had a 'fight'.\n\n\nContext.\nThanksgiving came around and my stepdaughter spent it with us. Her mother and her husband had decided to go on vacation and didn't invite her. Her dad told her to come to us. I didn't mind, as I and R didn't have any issues. She'd met me a few times before and I thought we got along. She's a very pretty, smart young girl, despite not having a job or being in college. Now, R has not seen me since before we had our twin girls (3) almost four years ago. Back then I was very tiny, but due to the weight I gained from the twins, and my pregnancy now, I'm about forty pounds heavier. The weight just didn't want to fall off, and honestly, I kind of liked it. Anyway, Thanksgiving was only us and R. R came in and immediately made a face at me, like she didn't know who I was. After a moment she gave me a short hug and was like 'You, M?'. Okay, she'd not seen me in almost three years, it's okay, and I laughed it off. Throughout dinner, R kept staring at me, and even gave me a few backhanded compliments. Like 'You've changed', 'The gap between your thighs are nonexistent!' And etc. My husband was clearly agitated but didn't say anything, and I grew quieter and quieter. The twins even caught on and my eldest, S, even told her to shut up. \n\nThis set R off\n\nR jumps up and tries to jump over the table to where the twins and I were sat, to get to my THREE year old. I immediately jump up and sort of, yank her away from my kids onto the floor. I back away after, apologizing. R doesn\u2019t care, she jumps up and attacks me like a wet cat. She claws my face, attacking my bump, and kneeing me wherever she can get. I shove her off me, yank my twins up, and run into the kitchen. They are screaming, my stomach was cramping, and my nose was obviously bleeding. My husband and she were yelling. I called the police.\n\nThey get there and I decide to not press charges, but by this time I am whizzed off. I tell them I want her gone and a restraining order if she doesn't want me to press charges before I take my kids with me to the ER. I leave my husband to take care of the rest. I had to go on bed rest for a while, as my daughter had experienced extreme distress, my nose was broken, and my foot was sprained (not because of her, I tripped on my way out of the kitchen). My husband felt bad, but he told me he didn't want me to go through with the restraining order and that I WTA to call the cops. That I was overreacting. This gave me flashbacks and I felt like I was being manipulated and talked down to. I took my twins and I left. It's been about a week and so and I'm back home, but I'm starting to think I might have overreacted. She came to us struggling and I didn't control my kids. But, did she have a right to attack me? My husband is mad, her mom called me to tell me what an asshole I am, and she's telling people I started it. I don't have friends. I feel like I'm 24 and stuck again. AITA? What do I do?\n\nContext before context:\n\n\nEdit: my stepdaughter didn't have any interest in living with or visiting us beyond a few phone calls with her dad. She prefers living with her mom and they live two states away *but they have a home near us where R was going to stay with a few friends after Thanksgiving \n\nEdit 2: I cannot leave my husband, he's my financial dependant. I'm trying to but I have to think of my children. I have another year of college to go. Do I need to do a full context?? I didn't want to throw a pity party but I don't think you guys are understanding. :(( or maybe I'm just not getting it.\n\n\nEdit 3 context before context (?)\n\nI was 18 when I married my first husband. He was almost three times my age and he was very physically and emotionally abusive. He didn\u2019t give a dang about me. I suffered two miscarriages, attempted suicide, and ran away after. My husband (P, 44) was the first man who cared about me. I was seeing another therapist after my messy divorce where he worked. He took care of me and set up for future education. I got my GED the year we met, and started college soon after. Up until now he's been nothing like my ex partner.\n\n\nEdit 4: I've read almost all your comments, and I've decided to move into a hotel for a few nights with my twins. Me and my husband will be going to dinner tonight or tomorrow night to discuss this situation. He says there's more to the story than what he's told me. Keep you guys posted. Thank you.",

The boys and I are huge basketball fans. \"A\" is a big Phoenix Suns fan (we used to live in Phoenix) and \"T\" is a Denver Nuggets fan (he was born in Colorado). \n\nWhen the NBA schedule comes out, I usually try to arrange for us to go to some games. This year, the Suns and Nuggets are playing on Christmas Day. \"A\"'s birthday is in November and \"T\"'s birthday is mid-December, so I bought tickets as a joint birthday gift for the boys. That was back in September. We did not tell the boys about the tickets, but they would find out on \"A\"'s birthday. \n\nIn October, \"T\"'s bio-dad came back into the picture and talking about how he wanted to be a family. For context, early on in us dating, \"T\"'s bio dad came back into the picture for a little while. My ex broke up with me and went back to him. That lasted about three months. When she came back, I said I want to make it work, but if something like that happens again, I am ending the relationship permanently. Rather than shutting him down, my ex was entertaining his overtures. I told her she needs to make a decision, she decided she needs to give it a chance. So, they moved out and moved in with him. This time it lasted three weeks before he gave up again. My ex and \"T\" were forced to move in with her very religious Muslim family. \n\nWhen \"A\"'s birthday came around, I gave him the tickets and said he could invite whoever he wants with the extra tickets. He decided to invite his two best friends who are twin brothers. I talked to their mother and she agreed. The twin's mother and my ex work together as receptionists at a hotel. \n\nMy ex reached out to me this weekend. My ex is working on Christmas and asked if I would have \"T\" over with us because her family does not do Christmas. I said we have plans and left it at that. I guess the twin's mother and my ex were talking and my ex asked what she was doing with her boys for Christmas since she was working. She told my ex about the game.\n\nMy ex called me angry. She said how could I use \"T\"'s gift for other kids? Can I just buy another ticket and bring \"T?\" I might have considered that if \"A\" agreed and prices were not astronological now, but they are. She called me all types of AH, that I am punishing \"T\" for her actions, etc. I think I am 100% in the right, but would love to see if there is a counter argument. \n\nAITA? ",

The difference here is this bonus is exponentially more than either of us ever receive in a year.] ",

She has raised my daughter with me, had always been kind and warm with my family, as had handled their many slights over the years with incredible self-control and grace. My family (mom, 4 older siblings and their spouses, 2 adult niece/nephews and their spouses) are homophobic, self righteous \u201clove the sinner, not the sin\u201d types. They refused to accept that I am a lesbian and still say I\u2019m going through a phase. They refuse to acknowledge my marriage and, over the years, did everything they could to alienate and isolate my wife and me. Examples: banding together against my wife (then long term live-in girlfriend) coming to family vacations, attacking me anytime I \u201cfell out of line\u201d by doing something like holding my wife\u2019s hand around them/their kids, called her \u201cbabe\u201d or introduced her to other people as my wife, telling me I\u2019m an abomination, telling my daughter (7 y/o at the time) that marriage is between a man and a woman only and that two girls or two boys do NOT belong together because god says it\u2019s wrong, giving us the silent treatment at family gatherings to make us feel unwelcome. Several years ago, I drew a line in the sand and demanded they either treat us with dignity and respect, or they wouldn\u2019t be a part of our lives. Needless to say, I ended up going no contact. It\u2019s been hard, especially for our daughter who misses her cousins, but it\u2019s been better for us spiritually, mentally, and physically.  This was incredibly hard though because I lost access to several nieces and nephews who I had been very close with, a daily person in their lives, and I adore them. They stopped being allowed to be around us because of our \u201cgay influence\u201d and them not wanting to think my wife and my \u201clifestyle is normal.\u201d I still send gifts to my nieces and nephews for Christmas. It bothers me immensely that for years, I\u2019ve signed the cards \u201cfrom Aunt *Me* and \u201cAlma\u201d (my wife). It pisses me off that my daughter refers to my siblings spouses as \u201cuncle\u201d \u201caunt\u201d as a matter of respect, based on their marriage. In fact, partners of people in the family (unmarried) have been referred to as \u201cAunt\u201d and \u201cUncle.\u201d My siblings told their kids in the past that Alma is not their aunt because that would through  marriage and 2 women can\u2019t be truly married in God\u2019s eyes. I\u2019m thinking of signing the card this year from \u201cAunt *ME* and Aunt Alma to affirm my wife\u2019s role as my spouse and push back for my own dignity, considering she is my legal wife. This could make me an AH because I know my siblings will be seething when they see it, feeling like I\u2019m trying to influence their kids or something; it could ruin an otherwise good day for them. My wife thinks it\u2019s pointless and will only cause more division. So please help me know if I WBTAH for doing this? ",

      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI had a small group of women friends whom I was pregnant with a few years ago. We bonded and we're excited to welcome our babies around the same time. It came time for me to have mine and in the first few months, I felt very judged by one of my friends. She told me she was concerned about my baby's health, sleeping, weight and eating. My baby was by the books perfect and met every milestone and gained weight exactly as all babies should. After holding onto this judgement for several months, I began to notice other instances where this friend talked negatively about every other mom in her life. I started to build up some anxiety and pain and with the help of another friend, confronted my friend with a letter explaining the hurt id endured early on in my mom journey. I told her I still want to be friends but a conversation was too painful and I just want an apology and a promise not to judge me as a mother.\nShe didn't respond and I haven't seen her since. I moved on.\n\nAnother friend of mine still remained pretty close but in the last year, I've been distancing myself from her for many reasons. The main ones being she speaks negatively about her husband in front of others (and in front of him) making people feel uncomfortable, she doesn't ask how I am doing (or anyone else) and will talk about herself, her work, and her child no stop, and she doesn't put much effort into friendships. She also is very type A (nothing wrong with that) but she thinks her opinions are the greatest and everyone should do as she is doing. Similarly to the other friend, i had a lightbulb moment where I realized she talks negatively about people in her life and gives others HUGE expectations but does little to show up for anyone else. The last straw was when I unintentionally exposed her and her family to COVID (I tested positive after we hung out, but negative the day before bc I had a sore throat) and after a profuse apology where I think I said I'm sorry a thousand times, she still gave me grief for days. I decided I only wanted to put in the effort I was getting back so I did the bare minimum in the friendship and lol and behold, she isn't speaking to me either.\n\nI know maybe communication could have been better on my part and I could have tried to bring issues up to people. However, my personality is that I love and am fiercely defensive of my friends and try to understand where they are coming from, even when they show negative attributes. But, once a switch turns on for me, and I see who they really are or see certain patterns, I can't go back. \n\nI have a lot of strong friendships in my life, friends I've had for decades and I make new friends easily. I've also had fleeting friendships that come and go (with jobs, relationships, etc) but these 2 are really bugging me.\n\nAITA for not putting up with negativity in friendships? ",

My sister\u2019s oldest is also 11. Her son Sherman is in the same K-6 elementary school my daughter Everleigh is in, they are both in 6th grade. Sherman and Everleigh used to be pretty close, they started drifting apart a few months ago when Everleigh started \u201cdating\u201d Dayton (11M). I thought this was just Everleigh getting caught up in silly preteen love.  \n  \nThat was until Sunday, we invited my sister and brother and their families over to help make baked goods for an upcoming holiday bake sale at the school. Dayton was with us. Once my sister arrived with her kids, Dayton ran into our basement and Everleigh followed him. I wanted to see what they were doing, so I went to go in their and saw they locked the door to the basement, which Everleigh knows she isn\u2019t allowed to do, so I started knocking on the door until Evereleigh opened it and asked me to come inside and talk, so I went in the basement.   \n  \nShe told me that Sherman and his best friend Allan (11M) have a history of bullying Dayton. She gave me multiple examples. Dayton plays basketball and that\u2019s his biggest passion in life, Sherman and Allan have repeatedly called Dayton and his friends \u201cstupid jocks\u201d. This is despite the fact that at a recent trivia bowl at the school, Dayton and two of his basketball teammates beat Sherman, Allan and another boy and won the championship. I was there and didn\u2019t see any problems, but I was told the day after in school, Sherman and Allan said that they only won because of the \u201cc\\*\\*nk\u201d on the team, referring to a Filipino-American boy in their class and a close friend of Dayton. Dayton reported this to the teacher of the class Allan and Sherman are in and both lost recess for a week and got a phone call home. They also mock his religious beliefs. Our family is atheist, and so is Allan\u2019s family. Dayton\u2019s family is also atheist, but he started to go to church with the aforementioned Filipino boy, his family is quite active in the Salvation Army near us and Dayton is a Christian and involved with them. Dayton has never tried to preach to anyone to my knowledge, but he does have a Bible bracelet thing he got off the TikTok shop and wears a cross necklace, I know his faith is important to him and Allan and Sherman have mocked him for praying at lunch.   \n  \nI went up to my sister ans asked to talk to her in my bedroom, I mentioned everything that happened and she said that Dayton and Everleigh were \u201cexaggerating\u201d some \u201clight teasing\u201d and accused their teacher of pushing an agenda to go after Allen and Sherman. She said that she has things under control and not to worry.   \n  \nI went back downstairs and told Everleigh and Dayton to stay down. I told my sister that if she didn't make Sherman apologize, that they would have to leave. She tried to ger Sherman to apologize, but he refused and doubled down. He was laughing and clearly had no remorse for his actions. I told my sister she needed to go home and talk to Sherman.   \n  \nAllan and his family were also supposed to come on the cruise, I was able to get Allan\u2019s mom\u2019s Facebook and messaged her there, she defended her son and called Dayton a \u201ccrybaby\u201d. I tried contacting my sister again, and she started to yell at me for contacting Allan\u2019s mom and trying to \u201cembarrass\u201d the boys. I told her that if she didn\u2019t get her son in line, I would be fine missing the cruise and losing the money and taking my kids and Dayton somewhere nice, and texted Dayton\u2019s parents about what went down, who told me more stories about mean things the boys told Dayton\u2019s other friends.   \n  \nMy mother started texting me after I got off with my sister asking me to pick up. She said that I can\u2019t just abandon my family over this and said that my sister and I need to \u201ccome together and compromise\u201d. I told her that I wasn\u2019t going to compromise on standing against bigoted 11 year old pricks. AITA?",

I thought we vibed really well, she had a really nice and funny demeanour and we had lots of engaging conversations on FaceTime.\n\nWe set up our first dinner date last week. I proposed a really nice restaurant which was sort of far from where we lived, but I really wanted to treat Ana because I thought she was special. Ana asked if I could pick her up and then after the date drop her off at her best friend\u2019s place. I didn\u2019t mind it all. Ana said she had movie night with her best friend.\n\nI picked Ana up and we went to the restaurant. The date went better than expected, we vibed really well. Ana also had drinks since I was the designated driver. However, right at the end of the date, Ana asked if I would drop her off at Josh\u2019s. I was initially confused and then realised Josh was her guy best friend. \n\nAna instantly realised what she said and it sort of became awkward. Ana apologised and I told Ana there was no reason to apologise. I was just curious about who Josh was so I asked Ana, and Ana said he was her guy best friend, and they occasionally have movie nights. Ana said she wanted to be honest with me because she really liked me and saw a future with me, and she admitted they sometimes make out during these movie nights but it doesn\u2019t go further than that. \n\nI appreciated Ana\u2019s honesty, but this whole thing felt like a huge gut punch. I was maybe in my feelings but I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I told Ana to just ask Josh to pick her up, and I paid for my portion of the dinner and left. Ana looked really sad when I ended the date and left.\n\nI felt sort of guilty about it later and called my sister to ask her if I what I had done was right. My sister said I shouldn\u2019t have left Ana stranded at the restaurant, especially after Ana was really sweet and honest with me. I told my sister how I could be expected to take Ana for a really fancy dinner, and then drop off her at her guy best friend\u2019s house, where she would then make out with him.

I hate little kids they are gross and clingy. She brought her friends with 2 children of ages 5 and 6. Before the trip, I begged her not to invite them due to them having kids, but she said no. These children stayed in our hotel room, their family got the second bed, my dad and stepmom got the other. I slept on the floor on my own birthday. We couldn't ride any of the rides I wanted to, because they were too little. These children also stayed with us without their parents because their parents \"needed a break.\" Another thing to note is I was not familiar with these children, and like stated earlier I do not like small children. I have autism, and being around all of these other people at cedar point was enough for me, I didn't need to hang out with them. The floor of the hotel room also gave me some sensory issues with it, because it was scratchy and all I got was a sheet that I used to be warm because they had the AC on. I would've rather not gone if I had known I would've been treated like that for my own birthday trip.",

After graduating, most of them moved out of state, but they still keep in touch pretty often through their group chat. They don't see each other often aside from weddings, birthdays, etc. \n\nHis friend's birthday was this past weekend so everyone came down to go out and celebrate. On the first night, they decided to meet up at a bar we  frequent. I didn't plan on going out with them because I wanted him to have time with just his boys since he doesn't see them often, but he insisted and I thought it was sweet of him so I did. We drank, played darts, and were having a good time when his friend we'll call D (35M) shows up. Right away, he calls my boyfriend over to the bar to speak to him privately, which I thought was odd at first but I didn't think too much of it. D stays for maybe 30 more minutes then tells us he is leaving. Again, it strikes me as weird because he was the last to arrive but first to leave. My boyfriend offered to buy him another beer to get him to stay, but he says he has a long drive and heads out.\n\nAt the end of the night when we leave, my bf tells me that D left to go hook up with this girl two cities away. When D called him over to the bar, he was showing my boyfriend he was exchanging with the girl (I guess showing off in some weird, sick way?) Apparently he was using his time down here as an opportunity to step out while his wife was at home with their child. My bf was trying to talk him out of going saying he was stupid and that he was lucky he was forgiven before, but now that she is pregnant with their second child, he probably won't be given that same grace.\n\nI was extremely upset because I adore his wife and so does the rest of the group. She is practically family. She is so sweet and she has already forgiven him for inappropriately texting other women for the sake of their child. My bf doesn't agree with what he's doing, but none of them want to get involved or interfere with their marriage. I refused to go out again the rest of the weekend if he were there and I also told my bf I refuse to speak to him because I have nothing to say to him nor do I \nwant anything to do with him moving forward. My boyfriend understands, but I feel like I put him in a weird spot. He went out with them two more times, and they have asked about me and where I was. I won't lie, I can't help but feel a little bad. Am I handling this appropriately, or am I being an AH? ",

My job often requires late nights, and so does the job of one of my colleagues, who I\u2019ll call Emma (not her real name). We\u2019ve always gotten along well, and I\u2019ve been happy to help her out when I can. A couple of months ago, Emma mentioned she was nervous about taking public transport late at night after a particularly scary incident where someone followed her from the bus stop.\n\nI felt for her and offered to give her a lift home whenever we finished late, as her flat is only about 15 minutes out of my way. At first, this was fine\u2014she was really grateful, and I was happy knowing she was getting home safe.\n\nBut over time, things started to feel\u2026 off. For one, Emma began expecting the lift rather than asking. She\u2019d linger around the office waiting for me instead of heading out, and if I tried to leave without her, she\u2019d make comments like, \u201cOh, I guess chivalry really is dead.\u201d\n\nThen she started pushing it further. She\u2019d ask me to make detours to pick up things for her or drop her off at places other than her home. For example, she once asked me to stop at a 24-hour shop so she could \u201cgrab a few essentials,\u201d which turned into a 20-minute wait in the car. Another time, she asked me to drop her at her friend\u2019s place instead of her flat, which added an extra 30 minutes to my journey.\n\nWhen I gently told her I couldn\u2019t keep doing this because it was adding to my already long days, she got defensive. She said I was being selfish and implied I didn\u2019t care about her safety. She even made a snide remark about how she\u2019d \u201cfind someone who actually cared.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve now stopped offering her lifts altogether. She\u2019s been giving me the cold shoulder at work and has even told some of our colleagues that I \u201cabandoned\u201d her late at night. A few people have said I should\u2019ve just put up with it for the sake of workplace harmony, but others agree she was taking advantage.\n\nI feel bad because I know the world isn\u2019t always safe for women, especially late at night, but I also feel like I was being taken for granted.\n\nAITAH?",

I can go on and on for days about what we lived through.\n\nFinally, she gave up and had me and my sisters go live with our dads because she was home less again. I didn't see her very much while she was homeless, maybe 4 times or so. About a year later, she got a house again, but by this time, I had settled in at my dads house and was doing so much better than I was before and I realized that I was better off staying at my dads. \n\nI didn't want to tell her this, so I kept dodging the question. She was always saying nasty stuff about my dad and saying things like \" I don't want to be alive if I can't see my kids.\" I finally decided to go no contact with her in May 2024. She had a hard time respecting the hard boundaries I set in place. She has tried many things to get access to my life, going as far as to try and contact my school for records. I decided to ask my dad to try and legally amend the court order which is old so that she will no longer have those rights. She was served with the papers a few days ago, and my grandparents told me that she is really upset by this. I've been told this will ruin Christmas.

All of that was of course untrue.\n\nAfter reading all the comments (thanks for the all the advice) I decided that I wouldn't be apologizing for what i said, but I was willing to discuss the issue with her, instead of immediately breaking up like some suggested - even though I know she really crossed a line by lying to my parents. I think some people were under the impression that I screamed at her, this wasn't the case. I did snap, but when I said what I did I barely raised my voice. If I had screamed at her, I would apologize.\n\nIt got to yesterday evening and Lana had still not returned home. Realizing that I actually needed my car the following morning, I got my friend Mark to drive me to my parents house. I called Lana three times, but she didn't answer. Instead I sent her a text, saying that I wanted to talk, and that I'd come by my parents place soon. Turns out this was a mistake. \n\nWhen we arrived my car was nowhere to be seen and my mum said that Lana had left about 10 minutes ago. I called twice again and no answer. I was in the middle of texting her that if she didn't return my car, I'd be calling the police, when I got a notification from my doorbell camera. She was back at home, and my car was back in the driveway. All was good, or so I thought.\n\nMark drove me back home, but when I tried to get back inside, Lana had put on the inner latch on the door, so I was locked out.  After a few minutes of calling out to her to let me in, all I heard from her was \"Fuck off\". Now I was done. There would be no calm conversation, we were done. \n\nThankfully I was able to climb over the back fence (didn't think I'd make it in the shape I'm in), and get in through the back door. Once inside I told her that she had until that evening to get out. At the time she didn't even protest. She just packed a bag and a friend picked her up an hour later.\n\nThis morning she has tried calling multiple times. She's now messaging that she's sorry and wants to talk, but I'm not interested. I messaged her that I've packed all her stuff and she can get a friend to come and get it, or I'll put it outside for her to pick up, but she won't be getting in my house again.\n\nNow I'll be staying home until I can get the locks changed. I've got a financial agreement in place with her, so she's got no claim on the house or any of my property, so this should be the end of it. Again, thanks for the advice",

We had a shared apartment, but in June, I got a great job about two hours away from her school in my hometown. I have since bought a house and she was supposed to move in at the beginning of January. The lease in the apartment we used to share ends at the end of this month. \n\nIn September, I started to notice her being distant with me. I thought nothing of it. There was a new guy in the program she started mentioning, I thought nothing of it. Well, a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving I got pretty irrefutable proof she was cheating with this guy.\n\nI was more angry than I can put into words. Originally, she was planning on coming to see me the weekend before Thanksgiving before she went home for the week. I made up some excuses for why she couldn't come, so I did not see her.\n\nWhile she was gone for Thanksgiving, I took what stuff I had of hers at the house, and took it to the apartment. I wrote a detailed letter about the cheating, how I felt, and letting her know I was breaking up with her. I also wrote her a check for my part of the rent for December, but told her she needs to make arrangements for the other things. I paid her car insurance, health insurance, and cell phone each month. I also went about changing passwords, locks, passcodes, etc., so she could not access anything of mine.\n\nShe got back to the apartment on November 30th and saw the letter. She lost it. She called repeatedly, I did not answer. In the early morning hours of December 1st, she showed up to the house trying to get in, she couldn't. My friends started calling me. I told them I was fine, but that I would not see or speak to her under any circumstances. I told them to ask her to leave. Eventually she did.\n\nI still have not spoken to her and don't plan to ever. Some of my friends are saying I am an AH. Apparently her account is overdrawn because I usually put money in her account at the beginning of the month to cover her bills, but since I didn't, money came out and caused her to have a negative balance. She has absolutely nowhere to stay once the lease ends at the end of the month. And she just wants to talk to me for closure. I refuse. They ask if I could at least give her some money to get her account balance back up, but I refuse.\n\nAITA? ",

We're each our own kind of Autistic and neither of us want children because of how neurotic we can be at times. We do quite well for ourselves and have plenty of disposable incomes because we kick-started our careers early and saved early on (I'm a journeyman electrician and in the process of getting my electrical engineering degree, and my girlfriend is on her way to becoming a nurse practitioner.) We're both super busy as you can imagine, with both work and school and such, and it can get rough at times but we manage. \n\nMy father passed away a year ago, and it sent shockwaves throughout our small family, and now my mother moved in with us after selling her house because she was getting too old to live on her own (she had me at thirty four and she lived out in the country, so it wasn't the safest for her.) She cooks and cleans while we work, buys the groceries with her SS, and generally tries to make herself useful even though we tell her it isn't necessary. We appreciate her efforts due to how busy we are (our diets absolutely have improved lol) but we're worried because doesn't have a lot of hobbies and oftentimes doesn't know what to do with herself, I'm not sure why she hasn't looked for any hobbies, but that's her choice I suppose. \n\nI'm her only child, and recently (over the past few months) she's started to pester the both of us about giving her grandchildren she can spoil. At first I made a joke about our cat being her grandchild, and she thought it was funny but didn't stop. I figured it was just a phase and that she'd move on, but she didn't. Every day she just kept making these little comments about grandchildren and that our kids would be adorable. It was easy to ignore at first, but she wouldn't stop. \n\nThen one day I had a hard week at work and didn't get enough sleep at all, and while she was making breakfast the next morning she kept bringing it up and kept trying to make it into a serious conversation, talking about how a grandchild would make her so happy. I finally snapped and told her to let it go and I got loud (nothing serious, but I did tell her she was unbearable when all she thought about was grandchildren and I couldn't understand why she couldn't just get the fuck over the fact that me and my SO were Child-free and happy.) She continued the rest of the meal in silence, and proceeded to give me the cold shoulder for the rest of the day. \n\nThat was several weeks ago. She's like a completely different person now. She still cooks and cleans and stuff, but she barely talks at all, and when there's nothing to do she just sits on the couch and rots away, eyes glazed over as she watches family feud, antique roadshow, and whatever else old people watch. She never wants to go anywhere or do anything, especially not with us. Whenever I try to have a conversation with her that's more than discussing a basic necessity she just gives me a dirty, bitter look and I usually back off. She just dies whatever chores she sets out to do that day (we don't require anything from her, this is all out of her own volition) and then just watches TV (watching is a strong word, more like she just sits there and just... rots. I can't think of a better word for it.) \n\nSo recently me and my girlfriend were talking and we found a great deal on a cruise and decided to go since we had amassed a lot of PTO. We bought the tickets and surprisedbher with one, thinking a cruise from Budapest to Amsterdam would cheer her up. She just glowered at the tickets like I had handed her a bag of dog shit as a birthday gift and then asked me what it was for.

His mum (my wife) left the father due to DV, and even after 8 years he still takes every chance to inflict emotional abuse. \nIm concerned the son is already in training to be just like his dad... \nWould I be the asshole for taking a stand and educating the son on what DV is amd the forms it can take and exactly what his dad did to his mum?\nMum is reluctant to burst her son's bubble &/or doesn't believe she can get through to him because he will defend his father...\nI though son's were enerally fierce defenders of their mums...\nI'm feeling lost and dont know what to do. How can a son deliberately put his mum in a suituation like this, where she will be, at worst, in the firing like of abuse, and at best, triggered by the fathers presence.\n\nFurther note: the father never contributes financially.to anything for either son. No school fees or equipment, uniforms, never invests time or effort in driving either of his sons to any extra carriculars (sports, music lessons, youth group). This year, for that the event/activity this event is to celebrate, we his primary carers have transported said son for 50+hours of travel, paid all fees and equipment required, emotionally and physcially supported, scaffolfded, coordinated and encouraged. The father has done nothing but conset to having less time with said son on some days to allow his regular attendance. His form is to turn up to the cebrations and behave sociopathically but everyone will see a \"proud, supportive dad and a lovely and charming man.\"\nIt makes me ill. I don't want to raise another mini version of his father and the behaviour of inviting both parties to the same event appears to also be a bit sociopathic to me! \nI have been and am still proud of my step-son's achievements, and want to be there to acknowledge and celebrate that, and our sacrifices in sulporting him all year, with him at this event.\nBut more than that I feel I must protect and defend his mother, my wife, and ensure this young man doesn't grow up ignorant of the damage done by DV and specifically, done by his father to his mum.\nAITA for making a stand on this!? \n\n**TL;DR**: Stepson, 13, idolizes his abusive father and seeks his approval, ignoring the impact on his mother (who left due to DV) and stepparent. Concerned stepson may emulate his father. Considering educating stepson on DV, but mother is hesitant. Feeling lost and protective of wife. Father contributes nothing financially or emotionally, yet appears charming to others. Unsure if taking a stand makes me the asshole.\n",

During dinner, she kept making little jabs at the food, saying things like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t quite how I would\u2019ve made it,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a little dry,\u201d and \u201cI would\u2019ve added more spices.\u201d She said it repeatedly and in a way that made everyone else uncomfortable. After about the fourth comment, I told her to stop, but she kept going, trying to correct my cooking methods. I\u2019m no professional chef, but I was proud of the meal, and it felt like she was disrespecting my effort.\n\nAt that point, I asked her to leave because I wasn\u2019t going to sit there and listen to constant criticism.

      "selftext": "Background is I'm in my late thirties. Came back from college and worked in the family business. \n\nWe're a retail / fast food ish business. Extremely seasonal. We are busy four months a year. We have about a dozen full and part time staff during the six-month busy season. \n\nDuring the off season I might have two-part timers. \n\nBefore COVID it was me, my dad, and my uncle working in the shop. There was always a member of the family in the shop. We could always monitor staff.\n\nMy mom worked in her home office doing staff scheduling and basic accounting. I do everything else. \n\nCOVID hits and I'm working in the shop alone with our mostly teenage and early twenty-year-old seasonal staff. Uncle and dad both retire and then die. My mom is still doing her scheduling and accounting work from home.\n\nI've been exhausted for the past five years. I work seven days a week but I'm not there from opening to closing. I know stuff happens when I'm not there. The business isn't running like it was when it was me, my uncle, and my dad but I'm trying my hardest. I've never worked this hard in my life. \n\nI think some of my staff think my mom owns the business and calls the shots. I think this is because she does the scheduling and signs the paychecks. The only contact they have with her is email and maybe a phone call. \n\nNo one outside of my mom knows I'm the owner and how I make all the decisions. I work right next to the staff. I try to be as modest and hard working as possible. I drive an old car. I don't try to act like the stereotypical jerk pompous boss. \n\nI hired this 18-year-old recently high school graduated guy. He seemed like a dopey kid. Finding and retaining help is a huge issue so I take what I can get. If I could have terminated him earlier, I would have. I just didn't have any staff. When it got busy, he did work. \n\nFirst big issue was this kid came to work smelling really bad. After a couple of shifts I had to take him aside and politely explain to him he needed to shower before work and wash his clothes. \n\nSecond big issue was he always came ten to fifteen minutes late. From what I understood he didn't have a license and took Ubers or his parents drove him. I didn't give him issues with it as he couldn't drive. I kept telling him numerous times politely to please come on time. He was good for a few months and then went back to coming a few minutes late. \n\nThen the guy couldn't stay off his phone. My rule is if customers are in the store, you can't use your phone. If you have to use your phone, do it discretely and when you don't have something to do.\n\nNonstop this guy couldn't stay off his phone. Constantly texting or scrolling on his phone. It was like he had a mental condition where he was compelled to be on his phone. Many times, customers are in the store standing a few feet away. \n\nI think I must have told him to a hundred times to get off his phone. He'd always say \"sorry\" put it away and then the next day he'd go back to using his phone. Or he'd have some excuse. \n\nThen he'd go to the bathroom a lot. I can't really tell staff they can't use the bathroom. I'm sure he went in there to use his phone. \n\nHe actually got better with phone usage after a few weeks, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nWhenever I'd tell him to get off his phone or come on time or correct him, he'd always have this smirk on his face like he was about to laugh at me. It seemed like he wasn't taking me seriously. \n\nIt turns out he was hooking up or dating a coworker. I didn't know. She was 16 and he's 18. I noticed if I called staff members together for an impromptu staff meeting and tell them something and they were both in attendance he'd make her laugh. I could have sworn he was making fun of me while I was talking. I never saw his face but it always seemed like she was looking at him and something always made her laugh or giggle. \n\nSeason ends. I don't think he had any idea how much I didn't like him. He asked me if he could work a bunch of hours off season. I would have given him hours, but I couldn't work with him, and I didn't really trust him. He seemed oblivious to how much he sucked.\n\nI gave him maybe five hours a week when I wasn't there, and a trusted employee was there with him. \n\nAbout two months ago I repeatedly found hair in food displays. I instituted a much tighter hair policy where anyone with longer hair had to either have it tied back or wear a hat to contain it. I told this guy he had to wear a hat as he had longer hair that wasn't tied back. I even bought him two hats to wear. I told him repeatedly he had to wear a hat while he worked. A few times he forgot a hat. Then sometimes he'd wear it and then when I left, he took it off. It seemed like he thought it was optional even though I must have told him a dozen times to put a hat on. I watched him on camera from home working without a hat after I left on probably a half a dozen occasions. \n\nI check the cameras last week when he's working and he's practically making out with this female coworker behind the counter. I'd never seen this before. She wasn't even on shift that day. He's also not wearing a hat after I told him \"you have to throw on a hat\" twenty minutes ago after he showed up not wearing a hat again.\n\nI get in my car and head to my shop. I walk in the front door. His \"GF\" sees me and runs out the back door. He heads to the back of the shop and I follow him. \n\nI told him I'd had enough and sent him home. He looked at me confused and then wanted to debate with me. He said he could be better, and he could work. I told him I didn't want to debate with him. I was tired of his behavior, and it was cumulative, and I just didn't want to deal with it. I brought up the hat issue as an example and he really didn't have anything to say. I told him when I told him to do something he needed to do it.\n\nThis summer I had repeated issues with another newly hired employees' attendance. I never yelled at him, but I told him very sternly he couldn't keep doing this. The guy constantly called out at the last minute. Then he needed to take a whole week off. I sent him home on his last day because he screwed the schedule up so much, I had someone to fill in for him. Apparently, he didn't like that, and he called my mom and complained about me. He told her he should be able to call out whenever he wanted, and it was my fault I didn't have someone to cover. He said I was mean and rude and unprofessional to him.",

He got really upset and said that \"people who have nothing to hide, hide nothing.\" He's been bringing it up daily, saying things like \"if you trusted me, you'd share\" and \"what are you hiding from me?\"\n\nSome of my friends say I should just give him the passwords to prove my loyalty and keep the peace.

I was planning on staying with her until she could find out what to do. Then Tavion came back out of the blue last week. After two months or probably more away. I was furious. I still am furious. Me and my sisters had a birthday party for my nephew who is now 7 years old. I didn't speak to him the whole time I was there. \n\nI talked to my two other sisters Natalie and Kaylynn and I also played tag and hide and go seek with the kids outside. I talked to Kaylynn's boyfriend and Natalie's baby daddy but didn't talk to Tavion. He was very upset the whole day. I'm a very talkative person cause of my sucky childhood. I didn't even talk to my sister Samantha tbh. \n\nBefore they left Tavion asked me why I didn't talk to them but everyone else. I told him the truth that to me he abandoned their kids and left my sister. And to me you don't do that. Leaving my sister is whatever you want to do but to abandoned your kids is fucked up and we grew up with a dad who was in and out of our lives and still is. And we want more for our kids. He told me I don't understand what it's like to be a parent and I told him stright up that I help them with literally everything. \n\nThey need food? You call me.\nThey need school supplies? You call me. \nThey need anything from anywhere? You call me. \n\nHeck they all call me their second mother. He told me he needed a break. I told him stright up that what he did was abandoned his kids not take a week or even a weekend away but he stayed two months away that to me is not a break. I also asked him what about my sister Sam she doesn't get a break. He told me she doesn't need one. I called bullshit and then he told me he still counts me as a little sister and that he loves me as one. I told him he was honestly nothing to me except my sisters boyfriend. He got mad and called me an asshole. I called him a punk ass boy who needs to grow up and that you don't get a break from being a parent until all of them turn 18 or even 20. \n\nSam asked me to let it go since she did. I told her just cause you let it go didn't mean I have to. That he abandoned his kids and that's something I can never forget. I told Tavion that he won't ever be my brother again. And he got upset. I told my sisters if they ever need a break to bring them to my house for the weekend and I'll take care of them until Sunday night but to not abandon their kids. And that goes to their boyfriends aswell.\n\nSo am I the asshole for telling my sisters boyfriend that he isn't my brother anymore after he abandoned his kids?\n",

I grew up close to my family and loved them all and enjoyed their company but that has changed since becoming a dad, at least toward a lot of them. It started when our boys were born and my wife and I dressed them in some colors that my dad and some of my siblings considered not boy enough. If they had too many colors or too much light colors it was seen as being more girly. There was a huge deal made out of these rainbow outfits we got for the twins when they were a few months old. My oldest sister said they were making a huge deal out of it and told them the outfits were cute and why were they being so OTT about it. Mom didn't say anything against it but said nothing to stand with us either. I had already told my dad and the siblings complaining that I wasn't going to tolerate it.\n\nBy the time the twins were one we saw far less of my family except for my sister and her family and my mom if she came alone.\n\nThings didn't improve and got worse when our oldest son preferred baby dolls and toy kitchen stuff over \"boys toys\". If he was in a room full of \"boys toys\" he'd grab a stuffy and treat it like a baby. He gravitates to that kind of toy. But the way my dad reacted was insane. He actually yelled at me for getting my son a baby doll and all the accessories that came with it for Christmas. My mom didn't stand up for her grandson and it was after that we pulled way back from most of my family. The final straw was my dad was going to take toys off the oldest and \"make him play with the toys his brother has\". I was not about to let him bully my kid. Or any of my family.\n\nMinus my oldest sister. She's still awesome and all our kids love her and her family.\n\nI see my parents and other siblings around. We don't spend time together anymore but they have approached in public and my dad and a couple of the siblings have complained loudly that my son still has those toys and that he \"acts like a girl\".\n\nMy mom reached out and told me it hurt her that I cut her out too. That she never complained or said anything and I said her not saying anything in our defense hurt and I couldn't trust her to not try to bring dad in. I said he wasn't good for my kids to be around but especially the oldest. She told me it wasn't fair and the kids deserve to have family around them. She said my dad and most of my siblings might say things that hurt but they love the kids. I said not enough if they can't love and accept them for who they are. She told me I was wrong to punish them like this.\n\nAITA?",

      "selftext": "To start, my fianc\u00e9 (20) and I (20) have been together for four years. We both come from military families, and he recently left for basic training a little over a month ago. This experience, among other reasons, has led us to decide to get married sooner rather than later. Despite some differences, we\u2019ve always managed to work through them maturely. He will be home for Christmas, and we\u2019re considering tying the knot during that break, allowing me to move with him when he starts AIT, as his MOS permits.\n\nWe've had many discussions about important topics such as finances, goals, religion, expectations, and political views, and I appreciate his hardworking, respectful, and positive nature. However, there\u2019s one significant issue that I\u2019m struggling to come to terms with\u2014his family.\n\nTo provide some background, I come from a small family and have learned that those who mistreat you often continue to do so. This belief contributes to my feelings that he should distance himself from his family. My own experiences have shown me how problematic family dynamics can hinder the establishment of a healthy relationship. I don\u2019t want to find myself in a situation where my partner fails to stand up for us, as I have witnessed in my own family.\n\nThe most pressing concern is that his father has been withdrawing money from my fianc\u00e9's bank account\u2014over $500 since he left for basic training, including a recent $100 withdrawal just yesterday. His father has no permission to access this money, which is possible because he is a joint account holder from when my fianc\u00e9 was a minor. While I have access to help pay off my fianc\u00e9's loans, he is understandably upset about the unauthorized withdrawals. He has yet to inform his father about his plans to come home for Christmas, and I\u2019m uncertain about how this visit will unfold.\n\nThroughout his teenage years, my fianc\u00e9 was expected to prioritize his family\u2019s needs over his own, often being criticized for not meeting their demands. Despite this, his family has never provided him any financial support. They have made him feel worthless and have even kicked him out multiple times, leaving him reliant on friends and I for support.\n\nCompounding the issue, I recently learned that my fianc\u00e9's younger brother, whom I helped get a job at my workplace, has been spreading gossip about me\u2014suggesting that I\u2019m not good enough for my fianc\u00e9 and questioning my loyalty. It\u2019s frustrating to see how their negativity impacts my personal and professional life, especially when I don't engage with them.\n\nI understand that my fianc\u00e9's family represents a part of his life, particularly since he lost his mother at a young age. However, I struggle with the idea of staying in a relationship where he maintains ties with people who disrespect him and, by extension, disrespect me. \n\nAm I wrong to want him to evaluate his choices regarding his family? Is it unreasonable for me to ask him to prioritize our relationship over unhealthy family dynamics? Friends and family who know a bit about the situation understand my concerns, but they also believe he needs to make this decision independently. My mother, who understands these struggles, fully supports my viewpoint.\n\nI\u2019m hoping to find some advice on how to communicate my feelings to my fianc\u00e9 effectively and navigate this.",

I told him I left it in the living room, but that it\u2019s actually mine and asked him where the other one is.\n\nHe says that I\u2019ve actually been taking his, and I was the one that lost mine. And that I always lose things, so I must\u2019ve lost it. I told him again, that it was actually the other way around and he\u2019s been taking mine. I didn\u2019t want to go to sleep and wake up with a low charge or dead phone on the morning of an interview, so I told him he probably left his somewhere \u201cdumb\u201d (as in a random place) in the office room. \n\nI went up to go check, but couldn\u2019t find it. I came back, and asked him where his work bag was. He didn\u2019t respond at first, and I said Hello? Where did you leave your work bag, I couldn\u2019t find it in the other room. He then tells me it\u2019s in the living room on the couch. \n\nI go and look inside his work bag, and surprise there is a cord with the other adapter in the pocket of the bag. \n\nI go back in the bedroom and said \u201cGuess what I found?\u201d And dropped the charger in the middle of the bed. He said he didn\u2019t recognize that charger and it wasn\u2019t his. I told him I found it in the work bag. I go to plug my cord in and plug my phone in to charge, and asked him if he admits I didn\u2019t take his. He said he didn\u2019t again, I guess he was actually annoyed but I thought he just was being a little sheepish atm and didn\u2019t want to admit it outloud. He starts \u201cyelling\u201d (not really yelling, just talking in a slightly louder tone more upset tone) \u201cAnd who is the one that always loses things??\u201d I then just started to realize he was kinda upset, but I said, \u201cBut I proved I didn\u2019t lose it this time though because it was sitting in your work bag?\u201d\n\nHe got really annoyed and said \u201cYou\u2019re being super annoying. I\u2019m going to punch your face if you ask me that again.\u201d\n\nI then told him he was just being pissy because he knows he was wrong and is mad that I proved him wrong. To which he said, \u201cwhatever you wanna believe.\u201d\n\nI feel like what he said was totally out of proportion, since I was just joking around, and because it\u2019s over something stupid. \n\nI admit I was being really petty, in pushing to get him to admit outloud to me that he did in fact take my adapter and I haven\u2019t been taking his, but was I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: He would never actually hurt me. We rarely ever argue, this really is just a one off occurrence. Also, we\u2019ve never really had problems with losing our chargers before so I never had to initial it prior to now. \n\nExtra context: I\u2019ve been taking a new medication that\u2019s been giving me severe insomnia/sleep deprivation and by proxy him as well (from my restless tossing and turning at night)",

Note: I've had this painting displayed for as long as she knows me (it hung in our first apartment we lived in after we got married) and she never had any problem with it before.\n\nMy college ex-girlfriend was an artist and made the painting for me a long time ago. It's a nice scene of a park we used to frequent when we were together and is very good craftsmanship-wise, so I kept it atter we broke up.\n\nWhen I told my wife this, she got really upset and asked why I wanted a reminder of my ex-girlfriend in our house. She said it felt gross and that if she'd known who made it, she wouldn't have let me hang it up in our bedroom in our previous apartment. I was surprised because I didn't think it was a big deal. That relationship ended almost ten years ago, and I really just like the painting now. It's not like I think of my ex-girlfriend when I look at it. l've just gotten attached to it over the years because it's been everywhere l've been and captures a nostalgic place I used to be fond of when I was in college.\n\nI tried to explain this to my wife, but she didn't want to hear it and said she felt \"icky\" and didn't want it in her house. This then made me frustrated because it's literally just a piece of art. In the heat of the moment, I told her she was overreacting and be dramatic and insecure. I said that she controls must of our decor which is fine, but that I was allowed to hang my own things up too.

I give her a hug and say she\u2019s lucky to have such a late night and she says oh the party\u2019s just getting started. I was confused but just laughed. For context she\u2019s got adhd and autism and sometimes just says things that to her make sense but baffle me, I too have adhd so I don\u2019t get what she\u2019s talking about but I get that to her she\u2019s probably just made a hilarious joke. \n\nAnyway I ask my sister what time is leya (niece) going to bed and she said \u2018oh whenever she\u2019s too tired\u2019 and I\u2019m like\u2026 but you know she\u2019s a mare when she\u2019s tired? And she kinda just brushes me off saying that she getting older now and wants to join in like our friends daughter did the last time.\n\nAnyway everyone else arrives and it\u2019s just a nightmare, she dominated every conversation, gets frustrated, keeps doing random attention seeking behaviour like pretending to grab the wine bottle etc\u2026 all the things you can expect when a divergent kid who craves routine is thrown off and tired basically. \n\nlots of the kids in the group are divergent, lots of the mums are single, so we all love and understand each others kids BUT the whole point of this time is to be away from the kids and just be ourselves. \n\nThe night ended with everyone having to leave early as me and my sister had to wrestle leya into her room with her screaming crying and fully melting down. I know it sounds dramatic because she\u2019s 11 but she\u2019s 5\u201d7 and quite overweight so she nearly threw me down the stairs during this altercation. \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything to my sister in the moment even though we all knew this would happen, she looked embarrassed and defeated and I felt like she just wanted her kid to be able to join in like the others can. I just said well done for trying your best. \n\nSo anyway the next session roles around and I\u2019ve volunteered to make a curry so we are hosting at mine. I nearly thought it was a mirage when I saw my niece walking up my driveway with my sister\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m like\u2026 is everything okay? Is Mac okay(her husband who would be looking after my niece) And my sister just says oh yes I just thought I\u2019d give him the night off.\n\nThey both just walk in and I\u2019m confused but also starting to panic. When me niece comes round I hide my PlayStation, my valuables, anything breakable. Not cash, she\u2019s not a thief she\u2019s just so destructive and you just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen if she has a melt down. I\u2019m not prepared and I tell my sister this. She\u2019s got her back up and says how it\u2019s fine and leya just wanted to prove herself after last week. Literally as she\u2019s saying this I hear something heavy drop upstairs. It\u2019s my porcelain doll from my great grandmother, and it\u2019s smashed, completely. \n\nI look at my niece and she\u2019s panicking, flustered, apologising, and now I\u2019m even more scared because I know I need to get her down the stairs before she fully melts down because I don\u2019t have a safe room for her to smash up. \n\nMe and my sister manage to get her into the car, and my sister says nothing. I am reassuring my niece trying to stop her from freaking out and going ape, but my sisters just in silence. \n\nThey left once she was somewhat calm and I text my sister saying I don\u2019t blame her for the doll, and I don\u2019t blame her for her daughter wanting to be involved with the big girls, but she can\u2019t show up unannounced with her especially not when it\u2019s supposed to be girls night and she knows I\u2019m totally child free so my home isn\u2019t baby proof never mind leya proof. Since then she won\u2019t speak to me, she\u2019s talking to the rest of the group and everything and told one person she isn\u2019t talking to me because I ostracise her daughter becuase she\u2019s disabled. I\u2019ve tried to message her, I even showed up at her house, she just closed the curtains. \n\nI just want my baby sister back and I honestly just feel awful but at the same time I don\u2019t think I\u2019m asking for much, the rest of the group say they agree with me but idk if everyone\u2019s just trying to play nice to everyone. I don\u2019t even really care if I\u2019m the asshole I\u2019m honestly just more interested in if anyone knows how I can fix this. We have never fell out like this but tbh I do very much have to be the bigger person a lot so idk, idk if she\u2019s done with me or just being mardy, this has just never happened before. ",

While boarding my husband got up to use the bathroom before the pre-flight announcements. As we double-checked our seat location, there was a woman already sitting in the window seat of our row with a baby. As soon as I put my purse in my seat to take off my sweater and settle in, her husband, came over to sit in my husband\u2019s seat. He looked at me and said \u201cOh, I need to sit next to my wife and baby.\u201d I responded, without moving out of his way, that it was my husband\u2019s seat; and he was in the bathroom. He said, \u201cWould he mind sitting in my seat?\u201d, and proceeds to point all the way towards the back of the plane. \n\nI immediately responded \u201cI can speak on behalf of my husband and that would be \u2018No\u2019.\u201d They both looked at me with confused looks on their faces like I somehow didn\u2019t have a right to politely decline. Then they tried to get the flight attendant\u2019s attention, but as they did that the person sitting directly behind the woman with the baby lifted herself up from her seat and said *\u201dIf you knew you were flying with a baby, you should have made sure your seats were booked together.\u201d*\nThey both looked at each other, then at the lady behind us, and blankly looked at me, while they mumbled something about trying to do just that, but couldn\u2019t for whatever reason. By then my husband was back and hers had already walked away. My husband sat down and I quietly told him was had just occurred (in case her husband might come back and ask him himself, or bring the flight attendant over) and he was glad I didn\u2019t let his seat go. With it being a long flight and him having anxiety about flying, he definitely didn\u2019t want to be sent to the back of the plane alone, and I definitely didn\u2019t want to be alone sitting next to a couple with a small baby for hours across the Atlantic. But I was even more appreciative of the woman behind us who spoke up, just because.\n\nSafe travels everyone. \n\n*Edited for grammar.  ",

My ex is still alive but she was in a car accident two years ago and requires around the clock care now so she's not able to be an involved mother to our kids. She and I were friends who tried being more but worked better as friends. I still love her as a friend. I visit. My kids visit. And my kids love their mom.\n\nI was dating my wife (30f) when my ex had her accident. We got married a year ago. She loves my kids and has mentioned that she'd like to adopt them. I had some mixed feelings on that and I spoke to my kids, just a general talk with no pressure to give an answer either way, but neither were on board. They didn't want a new mom. Which I respect. I told my wife I didn't think her adopting the kids was the right thing to do and at first she appeared to accept it. She told me she was disappointed but she also said she understood. But that wasn't the end of it and she has asked me why, she has asked me to reconsider, she told me about the benefits of her adopting them and she said she doesn't want to be considered a lesser parent because she's stepmom and not mom.\n\nMy kids feelings have remained unchanged. They like my wife but they do not consider her their mom.\n\nMy wife said I'm being unfair. That she's actively involved in the kids, she wants to mother them and to give them a mom back and she said I'm not letting her. She said if something happened to me she'd lose the kids and they'd lose her and when we have kids they'd be separated. I told her I wanted to act in my kids best interest and that's where my decisions come from. \n\nMy wife feels I'm unreasonable. She feels like I'm using her. She doesn't do all or even most of the child raising. She is a huge part of it but I'm very involved and active. I don't want her to feel used but I don't want to force this on my kids and honestly, it feels disrespectful to the mother of my children. But my wife feels I'm not respecting her.\n\nAITA?",

BIL (disabled) has killed 3 deer this year (all very young bucks) on my property. Prior to this hunting season I asked he not shoot more than 1 buck as I would like them to mature before harvesting. The first 2 deer he shot were \"button\" bucks which I can understand being mistaken as does as BIL has very poor eye sight. The 3rd buck harvested was unmistakably a buck and he shot it knowingly, a blatant violation of my wishes. Fast forward BIL invites his brother and nephew to hunt on our property without asking my wife or I. One day I walk out my front door and these two guys are just here sighting in their bows in my front yard. They didn't kill any deer thankfully. My wife and I ask for the BIL to please ask permission prior to inviting people to hunt. BIL and SIL agree to this and ask if his other brother and nephew can hunt here on Thanksgiving. Reluctantly I agree but ask that they don't shoot any bucks, also I say if they do shoot a buck there will be no more hunting. Anyhow the Nephew shoots a buck, I am \"Salty\". A week later after the 4th buck is killed the BIL and I are talking and I remind him no more deer hunting! He replies \"but my brother is coming in January, we can shoot does right?\". Me \"No Frickin Way, you've lost your mind you should have asked me prior to inviting them!\"  Now my SIL says family comes before all and believes I am a selfish AH for saying no more hunting here.  I say the BIL thinks he is running his own personal hunting lodge out of our house and he is being dang greedy.\n\nP.S. I have no problem killing a deer for meat but 1 or 2 deer is more than enough for 2 people for a year. I only have 5 acres so 4 deer is too dang many IMHO. Don't most people have rules for others hunting on their land (genuinely curious)? Are my rules unreasonable or are the In Laws just being self serving? When I bought this house and accompanying land I wanted no deer hunting for 5 years but capitulated because the BIL is ill and may not make it much more than a few more years. I feel I have no obligation to allow everybody and their brother to fill their freezers with deer from our property. I am done with ingratitude and greed and nobody will hunt on my land again other than my wife, daughter, son or myself. Going forward I will only allow animals likely to die within a year will be harvested. I believe in harvesting only mature animals and only what one can consume. So let me have it, AITAH?\n\nTLTR: Family wants to shoot all my deer and I say 1 or 2 per year is more than enough. ",

One day, I was wearing a body con dress and a cropped sweater and I sent her a picture of it. She said it was cute and told me to post it on my story. Ofc, I said no. She kept pushing me and I got upset about it and told her that she was being ignorant towards my religion. She backed off. After that, I went to bed to cool off. I woke up the next morning and when I checked Instagram, I see that she posted that picture of me on her public story. She has about 12k followers and more than half are guys. When I checked my requests, I had several requests from men. For people who don\u2019t understand the gravity of this situation, it\u2019s like if you sent your boyfriend nudes and he posted them on his story. I told her to take the story down and she refused. I begged her and told her that it was a matter of my dignity. She didn\u2019t care. She never deleted the story. At this point, I lost all my trust for her. I ended our friendship. I can\u2019t be friends with someone who would disrespect me like that. I told a couple of my friends about what happened and they had mixed responses about the situation. So I\u2019m turning to Reddit. \nAITAH? ",

      "selftext": "\\*TRIGGER WARNING\\* mentions of self harm and suicide. Me (14M), Mom(45\\~F), Dad (50\\~M), Brother (17M). Around 3-ish years ago I woke up from a nap and went into my dads office, just to see what he was doing. I was next to him when I looked down on his desk and saw a divorce paper. I of course was confused then broke down and my dad had the idea of going down to church and talk about it, but he didn't want to tell my mom because that would make things messy and we both weren't ready for that, so we tell her were going to get snack. Once we are at the church we had a talk and I asked a lot of questions like why and he asked\n\n\"you know how mom hasn't been around for awhile\" \n\nI reply yes and he tells me some excuse for why she was out for such a long time sorry I don't really remember what he said. Maybe a day or 2 later we were in the car and I asked him if mom was cheating because I was confused on why she would file for divorce for no reason and he says yes. He also tells me how he hired a private investigator to see what my mom was doing whilst she was away, turns out she was with her new boyfriend lets call him Brian this of course kind of shocked me and broke me. Over next few days I asked my dad about Brian and if he had a family, and of course he did. I also asked where they were going if he had a family and apparently they were going to a friends house. And I Also remember going to that house with my mom before she started disappearing, I also remember one of her friends being there lets call her Candle. And my dad goes on to tell me how Candle had a kid with a really rich guy then divorced him and got full custody so he had to pay child support.\n\n And as me and my dad got closer because of this we would go out and he would tell me some things like misery loves company and how he suspects Candle got mom into cheating. My mom would also always lie to us and tell us she was going to one of her friends house because a dog died or a friend needed help with something. And we all had to go along with the lies I also promised my dad I wouldn't tell my older brother.  My dad also asked me if I wanted to keep hearing about this stuff, I said yes but really didn't want to because it was destroying me on the inside and I was just hiding it. I also said yes because I thought it helped my dad because it gave him someone to talk about this stuff and listen. \n\nAlso forgot to mention this but Brian has 4 kids 2 older boys, and 2 girls one of the girls has down syndrome and is non verbal, (I don't know the ages of them) so when Brian and my mom were going to friends house he left his wife to deal with them on her own like my dad.\n\nThen my dad comes to me and says how he is about to call a family meeting and announce the divorce to me and my brother and told me to act like I didn't know anything. So my dad and mom sit me and my brother down and my mom tell us how they both wanted to get a divorce and so on.\n\nMonths after and my mom had moved out I started getting really depressed and started to cut my self, because I blamed my self a lot for the things my mom did, I even wrote notes on listing reasons on why I want to commit suicide, but like an idiot I left this note out and whilst I was a school my mom was cleaning the house and found this note and the same day me and my brother get called out of school. this was a shock to me and my brother and my dad takes us out to an art festival. After the festival my dad tells me that him and my mom were about to talk to me about the note my mom found, so we sit down and talk and I talk about how my mom disappearing for a year really sucked for me and mom was apologizing but I think that was because she only had to be sorry In the moment. My dad then goes on to tell me he is signing me up for therapy. \n\nLong story short I lied in therapy to make my dad look good, and got nothing from it. \n\nTimeline so far. Me finding out about the divorce: October-November, announcement of divorce: December, Mom moving into apartment: January, therapy: February. \n\nSkip to 6 to 5 months ago I was finally introduced to Brian my mom made me play drums for him and wanted me to let him play on my kit so I put my heart and soul into the fills I was playing to make him intimated to play and it worked, I don't want him touching my stuff especially my drums. But after this I went to my dads and he again gives me a heads up that he is gonna call me and my brother and talk to us about the private investigator stuff so now I don't need to hide it from my brother.\n\n(This time line is gonna get messy.) Fast forward a year and its again around Christmas time and I'm at my grandmothers on my mom's side playing pool and my grandpa got drunk and was telling me and my brother how strong my mom is and how good of a mother she is, this confirming my theory that my mom told her family that she was the good guy and that she sacrificed a lot of stuff for us. Now fast-forward to like 2 moths ago I went to go see the movie We Live In Time and my mom picked me up slightly drunk with her mom and a friend of hers both of them super drunk and I essentially have to babysit them and the friend tells me again how strong of women she is and how she's a great mom. These comments always crush me on the inside because they don't know the truth and I'm being told my moms great because she disappeared for a year. \n\nSo now my question is would I be the asshole for confronting my mom and telling my family about the truth or should I drop it because it was so long ago.",

      "selftext": "My husband and I (both 30s) married 5 years ago. Together we have a 3.5 year old son and he has an 11 year old daughter and a 9 year old son with his ex. Things with the ex were strained. She had three other children with a former partner who are 8, 7 and 6. My husband's ex died a year ago. For us it was sudden but she knew she was sick, she'd told the kids she was sick, and had told my stepkids not to tell us. Her former partner wasn't in the lives of the children they shared and none of her family stepped forward so my husband signed us up to take his ex's three children... without discussing it with me.\n\nThis was an issue for me. We argued about it and ended up talking about it a lot. I tried to work through it to not cause more upheaval for my stepkids or to pull my son's family apart.\n\nBut the mother's death changed my stepkids. They were bitter toward me and hateful toward their younger brother and their younger siblings have also been incredibly hateful toward us both and there were dangerous things happening. My husband carried on working and left me to do most of the parenting and he knew that would be the case before this. The case worker we had was helping with resources for therapy and grief support groups but I had to document several incidents where one of the kids tried to harm my son, there were open threats made to harm him also. My husband would help me when he was home but it was mostly still me alone with them. My stepdaughter told me a couple of months ago that her mom had hated me and they (she and her brother) used to love me but their mom knew I was bad and she raised her other kids to hate me. My stepdaughter also said her mom told her that my son was never their brother and they should never consider him equal to her kids. She said this to the case worker too.\n\nThe bio father of the other kids started paying child support but money isn't what I needed.\n\nIt reached a point where I could not leave my son out of my sight. My husband wouldn't do more and he argued when I said I was going to express to the case worker that having the other three kids was too much. He told me I'd make things worse if I did that and my stepkids would never forgive me or my son.\n\nSo I spoke to the case worker, got her report and I left my husband and filed for an emergency custody hearing and with the proof from the case worker I have temporary physical custody. My husband cannot see our son and I am working out the divorce.\n\nOf course he's angry and he told me I should have talked to him more first. But our son's safety is my #1 concern while he's worried my stepkids will hate him for separating them from the other three. His parents, who I always got along with, are also angry and they told me it was a sleezy way I handled myself. They said this even though they witnessed the harm my son was at risk of.\n\nI hate that it reached this point but I couldn't keep my son in that house anymore.\n\nBut AITA for my actions?",

My family and friends have been asking when we are going to have kids quite frequently over the past few months. I told them we are unsure if we want kids, and they make remarks that we would be making a huge mistake. I have been very nice about the question and their comments for a while but I hit a breaking point this week. We have been holding off because daycare costs are high and this world is honestly just very expensive. I am the first person in my family that will ever have to pay for daycare for my children. My mom and her siblings all had their kids watched by my grandparents. My aunts watch my cousins kids. All of our friends somehow have parents who are millionaires (not exaggerating) that are going to retire from their jobs to watch their kids. My mom has also made remarks about my husband getting a second job to have kids. This angers me so much because she had the luxury of her parents watching me and working a low paying job her entire life that made her \u201chappy\u201d. I feel like the ass hole for flipping out, but no one in our life seems to understand the financial stress this causes and how it\u2019s not just easy for anyone to have a child.

      "selftext": "*posting anonymously*\nso, I\u2019ve been looking for a way to get a non biased answer on this current situation me (25F), and my partner (24M) are dealing with. For some context, as it does matter, my partner has a friend named (it\u2019s fake for privacy reasons). \u201cJake\u201d, has been friends with my partner for over 7 years now and they\u2019ve relatively been close within the last few years specifically. Close enough to where Jake was crashing in the spare room at our place, (Our place being my partners house with both my partners sisters also living there). So as you can imagine, Jake is very close with my partners family as well with how often he stays there and is practically apart of the family.\nWe had noticed while Jake was staying at our place, that he was getting a little to close to my partners sister but we didn\u2019t think anything of it as we know that Jake knew my partners feelings on his best friends dating his sister. The only reason my partner doesn\u2019t want his best friends dating his sister is being of the potential and very likely fallout from the break-up leading to them no longer being friends.  And for some more context, one of my partners friends had actually previously gone behind his back and screwed around with his sister and when my partner found that out, he cut him off so quickly and Jake was there when this happened so he knew exactly why my partner felt the way he did. So my partners mom had actually caught Jake and my partners sister sneaking off to her room and we can imagine what they were doing and how often they were doing that behind everybodies backs... So i made sure to confront Jake and tell him he needed to have a civil and adult chat with my partner to make sure that he found out from him and nobody else, and i told Jake if he was seriously going to go for his sister to make sure it\u2019s the real deal and no BS. So i then called my partner out and told him jake had something he needed to tell him, and the truth comes out. And long story short my partner told him he\u2019s okay with it and he\u2019s super happy for them to be together, on the terms that they actually stay together and that it\u2019s not a quick hook up or nothing. So all is good, right? Wrong. We had noticed some tension from Jake through the next few months and it was just super off-putting considering my partner was okay with them dating as long as nothing changed between their friendship.  \nSkip to a few months after they\u2019re dating, My partners sister was having a bad day, and when my partner went to use the downstairs bathroom she completely freaked out on him and told him to \u201cGTFO\u201d, of her bathroom. So my partner being confused, refused to leave as it was an unreasonable request and the bathroom was technically not hers, but we call it hers because it is close to her room. So they ended up in a screaming match and it resulted with my partners sister screaming \u201cI\u2019m so happy i turned jake against you!\u201d. Pretty much giving us the reason as to why Jake has been giving us the cold shoulder recently\u2026 so when we heard from his sister that she turned Jake against us, it immediately rubbed us the wrong way and we decided to just stop associating with them within the house. My partners sister did write him a note saying she was sorry, but my partner just said he accepted it but just don't want to associate with her or Jake at this time.\nOkay, so now me and my partner are constantly being harassed by his mother to make up with Jake and sister even though she knows exactly what happened. What makes me even more confused is that they clearly don\u2019t like us, so why should WE apologize and try to make amends? His mom expresses to us often how much it hurts her that her kids are fighting, but i feel as if there is no going back to the old way. \nSo, AITAH for not wanting to make up with Jake and sister? \nAnd to be clear; we don\u2019t hate them. We just don\u2019t care for them or to associate with them. MIL has been trying to get us all together by offering to pay for a cruise for us to make amends, but me and my partner said no thank you but appreciated the offer. ",

And it's at her house. I get there around 230pm since I had things I had to do today. And Sam shows up around 3pm with her boyfriend of 4 years. Kay has a boyfriend of 2 years and he was an alcoholic so Kay doesn't really like him around alcohol and either does Josh. Well Sam decided to bring alcohol to my nephews birthday party. Which honestly is stupid since there was a bunch of kids and I think adults shouldn't drink while around a bunch of kids. One of Kay's house rules were no alcohol. I'm 21 and I barley even drink so that's a no problem for me. Well Sam decided to go against Kay's rules and bring alcohol. \n\nWell Kay asked her to take it Sam\"s house which is literally right next door. And Sam and her boyfriend both refuse to go \"all the way over to their house when they can drink it here\" I yelled at Sam and told her she needs to start respecting everyone's boundaries if she expects us to respect her boundaries. Sam got mad at me for calling her out but eventually they just put the alcohol outside the back door. And we got over it. Well I'm the talkative sister. I don't really like silence cause of my childhood so I normally do most of the talking expect today. I was really upset at Sam ngl. She noticed that I talked to my other two sisters and their kids plus Sam's kids aswell but didn't really talk to her. If she asked me a question I'll of course answer but I didn't go out of my way to have a conversation with her like I normally do. This got my sister a little upset. \ud83d\ude22 \n\nBefore she left she asked me why I barley talked to her and I just told her I need some space from her and her boyfriend she asked me why and I told her the truth that I love her but I'm very upset at the fact that you know Kay's boyfriend is an alcoholic and can't really be around alcohol and she told me she just wanted to see if he was tempted to drink it. We were outside talking and I might have raised my voice and said it wasn't her decision to do that. And that's when she told me she doesn't like Kay's boyfriend I then went off on her and I said I don't exactly like your boyfriend but you don't see me going around and tempting him with something he was addicted to. And that your boyfriend left not even a month ago and left his child before you made a threat that you would get full custody if he doesn't come back. And that Kay's boyfriend not once left her side or cheated on her and actually helps raises her other 3 kids that isn't exactly his by blood and that Kay's boyfriend is a better MAN then yours and she left upset and I told her to not contact me for a while. Kay and her boyfriend and Nat and her baby daddy are on my side but Sam and her boyfriend are calling me an asshole. \nSo am I an asshole for calling out my sisters lack of respect for her sisters boundaries?

      "selftext": "Hi everyone - I am looking for advice/feedback for a situation I am dealing with. Here\u2019s some backstory of my situation.\n\nI (24F) have had divorced parents for about 20+ years. My dad (60M) has been remarried to my step mom (58F) for about 14 years now. In the beginning we had a decent relationship when she didn\u2019t live with my sister, Dad, and I. After we all moved in together things got really rocky. She treated me very unfairly compared to her son, my step brother, and would constantly \u201ctattle tale\u201d on me when I refused to do something for her as a child. As I got older and went through my own mental health issues and struggles, she never was a support person for me. She tells everyone now, that she feels as if she did  something for me by praying that God would find a way to heal me. I don\u2019t personally believe in religion too much, but through years or therapy and medication, I definitely over came those struggles. She continues to share with others about her own struggles through life but does not openly want to help others in life with their own.\n\nWhen I became 18, I was thankful for becoming an adult because as I no longer needed to respect her. I refused to go her family things, and be there for her family no matter what because her family was never good to me. I have family members of her physically/verbally assault me, because that was a normal bringing up for them. Fast forward to now, my dad has shared with my multiple times that he is miserable in the marriage and wants to divorce badly. His fear with doing so is paying spousal support and losing everything he has since she has nothing without him. She is very greedy and selfish, and doesn\u2019t care about my dad\u2019s feelings. My dad recently told me he has been the worse he has been mentally for years, and I am starting to grow concerned. I work in the psychology field, and know the dangers of males being at a standstill in their mental health. My dad has tried to open up to her, but she shuts his issues down and tells him she had it worse.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I are due to get married in March in 2025. It\u2019s not a huge wedding due to personal issues, but we don\u2019t want to invite that many people. My step mom has never been a good person to me, and I always told myself growing up, I want true supporters at my wedding, which she is not. I mentioned to my dad that I personally would not like her to come, but my dad told me I should invite her so she doesn\u2019t take it out on him. But in the end it\u2019s me and my finances wedding and we get to decide. My fianc\u00e9 is also on board with me and respects my decision on what I would prefer to do. She also typically likes to turn other peoples events into her own sad story or about her wedding with my dad from years ago, and I don\u2019t really think I need to explain that boundary to someone in theirs 50s to be quite honest\u2026\n\nAITAH if I tell her she cannot come? Looking for advice as I feel passionate about what I want to do but don\u2019t want to come off AH\u2026",

      "selftext": "AITAH for wanting to leave home?\nI (15F) want to leave a house that emotionally distressing.\nSince I was younger I don't remember having much attention as a child, I have 7 siblings. 1 older and 6 younger. I feel my parents emotionally neglect me by gaslighting me or twisting my words during arguments, taking away rewards I never knew I'd get, and causing  me to have manic attacks. As of recent I bought my own phone, paid for and all. That set something in my parents off and since then my father hasn't talked to me (still wont) and my mother hardly talks to me. Recently we had a big argument that involved the phone. I got out of the shower and just sat down to check on my phone when my mom asked me to take out the garbage, due to personal reasons I don't like touching garbage or being near it. I told my mom I wasn't going to do it because she knows I don't like it and plus my hair is wet and it was below freezing. I recommended that she get my sister to do it (14f) since she wants to be more responsible and earn her phone back. My mom rolled her eyes and called my younger brother, whom she PAID to do it. I kinda got mad about it and said I know you wouldn't have paid me to do it. Which my mom responded you never ASKED so you'd never know. (Due to childhood trauma of parents lashing out when I'd ask the simplest things I'm still hesitant asking anybody anything). I got up and removed myself from the situation, but my mom followed and continued yelling at me. I think this is where I went wrong but I took my school backpack and put a couple sets of cloths and my money in there and told my mom if she continues antagonizing me I'm going to leave. My mom told me to GET THE HELL OUT AND LEAVE MY BACKPACK. So I did, I walked to my friends house and cried as I was never kicked out, I was contemplating calling the police before my mom texted me 'be back home by 10!!'. I got mad and responded 'no you told me to get the hell out so I'm staying out.\" My mom got my dad involved and he texted 'make the smart choice and be back home by 10' I shut my phone off and went to sleep. The next morning I went to school where a social worker and my parents were there. I set my phone to record and recorded the entire convo. Not getting in too much detail about it but I eventually stormed out crying and forgot to pause recording. When it all settled i listened and found out my parents want to send me to an ROTC bc I'm too much for them to care for and that I'm taking up 'too much attention'. (Remind you I was ignored till I turned 10). When my parents found out they yelled at me to the point where I had a manic breakdown begging them to leave me alone and I ended up breaking 3 fans and a small tea plate. My friend's family wants to take me in and my parents know but tell me it's nearly impossible bc I'm their responsibility till I'm 18. I've been ignoring them and going to therapy to talk about how I don't feel safe and I want to leave, but my Therapist thinks it's too harsh to leave my parents. AITAH?",

      "selftext": "I am F20 and this story for brought up recently at thanksgiving dinner and my siblings and cousins suggested I do a post asking reddit what they think. This story happened a few months before covid it was September of 2019 and I was going into my freshman year of high school. My dad had recently got a new job so we had to move from Oregon to Oklahoma for a year. I was already nervous being the new girl in a new school in an entirely new state, I knew zero people apart from my parents are my two brother (10 and 12 at the time). \n\nI tried to be one of those mysterious new girls because I had a weird obsession with twilight so I completely changed my personality to try and make friends with people. On my first day I was in the bathroom and this girl Michelle (fake name) started talking to me and saying she liked my scrunchies (This was peak vsco girl era). We got to talking and eventually asked me to hang out with her friends. Everyone here already kinda knew eachother from growing up in the same neighbourhoods and attending the same middle schools. I was lowkey kind of nervous but played it off and just tried to act like a cool girl. Idk if anyone here has ever watched skins but it\u2019s this British show and there\u2019s a character called Effy so I tried acting like her.\n\nShe introduced me to her friend group I\u2019m going to use fake names for privacy reasons. Derek, Hunter, Sarah and Bartholomew. He is called bartholomew in the story because he\u2019s a disgusting guy and needs a disgusting name no offence to the Bartholomew out there. Bartholomew starts talking about how his older brother Bartholomias was invited to a frat party and said he could bring a few people and judging by Bartholomew he seemed like the type of guy who would go off doing shiz like that at a young age kinda like that one little kid from Euphoria. Anyway I somehow get invited and when I got home I asked my parents if I could go. My 15 year old self obviously lied and said I was going to the movies with my new school friend. They said I could go so Bartholomew and his older brother took me, Michelle and a few others in his truck.\n\nOne we arrived I couldn\u2019t help but judge. It was a fairly big house but it was just a mess. There were random bottles of beer lying on the front lawn and one of the front windows was smashed. We walked in and there was about 50-60 ish people there and this was all new to me I hadn\u2019t even had my first sip of alcohol yet. After 30 minutes Me, Michelle, Derek, Bartholomew, Bartholomias and Bartholomias\u2019 older friends are sat in the living room and the older college kids are visibly drunk and one of them pulls out a j0int. \n\nIt gets passed around and everyone has a puff including the kids in my grade. I\u2019m the last person and I\u2019m trying to act cool but I have no idea what to say or do I\u2019ve never smoked anything before. One of Bartholomias\u2019 girlfriends comes over and teaches me how to smoke and inhale. After 2 minutes me, Michelle, Derek and Bartholomew notice Bartholomias and his friends are all acting super weird apart from the 2 that didn\u2019t smoke and they are sat there dying with laughter. \n\nI was the one to ask why they were laughing and Bartholomias\u2019 Minion number one blurts out \u201cThese freshmen just straight up smoked salvia\u201d and minion number two says \u201cThey are like 12 they\u2019re gonna die\u201d I am obviously confused to I google salvia as I\u2019ve never heard of it before. \n\nAs soon as I read it and watched a video about it I felt my heart start racing. It had been about 3 minutes since I had a puff and I was freaking out. What I forgot to mention is I am severely lactose intolerant and I had a homemade cheesecake that my Grandma made for my Dads birthday which was 2 days prior. This will become relevant later.\n\nI start wondering if or when it will kick in and as soon as I close my eyes I open them back up and it\u2019s like a ringing in my ear. Nothing will ever beat this experience this is quite possibly the worst thing that can happen to a human.\n\nI opened my eyes to see I was like on the ground unable to move in a kitchen of a restaurant. I can\u2019t talk or movie it doesn\u2019t even feel like i\u2019m breathing. Sometimes I see myself in third person sometimes it\u2019s first person. The only thing I know is I am a piece of garlic bread that has been left on the floor. My trip lasted for 1 year 1/2. When I came out of this weird trance I realised that it was in fact only about 9 minutes. I thought I was still tripping because everyone in the room was staring at me there was even more than before (15 ish people). Not only are they staring but they look shocked and horrified. The only thing I can blurt out is \u201cWhy the stare?\u201d \n\nI take a glance around the room and notice there seems to be some rather large stains on the floor and couch, Even a small amount on the ceiling. I look down and to my surprised I am absolutely horrified to see that I have popped my pants. But this was not just poop. This was a whole other level. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t brown it was almost a yellow colour it was runny and watery and worst of all it was everywhere.\n\nThe smell.\n\nThe.\n\nSmell.\n\nOnce I realised what happened my eyes filled up with tears and I look at Michelle and she just looks terrified. I then take a look at Bartholomew.\n\nHe was recording and STILL recording me.\n\nI try and ask him if he could please stop recording me and delete the video and to my surprise he said no. I then hear a snicker of laughter coming from Bartholomias. And that triggered everyone else to start laughing.\n\nI was mortified. \n\nThe only thing I can do is cry. But it gets so so much worse. I asked them what was going on and explain to them that I was a garlic bread for almost 2 years and that just causes them to erupt into more laughter which causes me to cry even more. Everyone is afraid to move and get covered in my monstrous pile of poop so when Bartholomew shows me the video the only word I can think of to explain how I felt was flabbergasted. \n\nI want you to all imagine a 15 year old girl sat on a green couch with her legs crossed like a Thai Monk chanting, \u201cgarlic bread garlic bread garlic bread\u201d. And once again\u2026 It gets worse.\n\nMy lactose intolerance kicks in at this moment and I start aggressively shitting myself whilst grunting and moaning from the shit pouring out of me. So now imagine this with the shit sounds. \n\n\u201cgarlicccuhhhhhh garlic bread eee ooo garlic bread *fart sound* garlic bread garlic bread *wet fart sound* garlic bre- *Diarrhoea fart sound* bread garlic bread *shit squirting out like a machine gun* garlic bread *belly rumbling sound* garlic *pause* *earthquake sounding shit that lasted exactly 12 seconds*\u201d \n\nThat is the only recreation I can think of to make. Just as I thought this nightmare was nearly over everyone starts laughing even harder whilst also shouting \u201cewwww\u201d I then get informed that Bartholomew has put this on his snapchat story. \n\nKill me now.\n\nEventually a very kind girl I think her name was Ava or Eva she deserves a shout out she sacrifices herself to try and help me up. Unfortunately, My confused and lowkey still tripping self stands up for exactly 2 seconds and passes out. As I pass out I slip on my own shit and land in a pile/puddle of my own wet and somehow solid shit. The shit splatters everywhere. Including into a dudes mouth as he was yawning.\n\nBefore you all start asking how this happened again someone was recording it wasn\u2019t Bartholomew but some random frat guy. \n\nEveryone starts laughing as yawning guy starts screaming and he eventually throws up. The combined smell and sight of the shit and vomit causes another guy to throw up. Which eventually creates a domino effect and exactly 9 people throw up and 6 leave the room from feeling nauseous. Ava/Eva Picks up my phone and uses face ID to get in and call my parents to pick me up. \n\nAs you can imagine they were not pleased with me.\n\nI have a long shower and bath and then sleep for about 16 hours and have a long and serious talk with my parents. Not only did I absolutely embarrass myself at my first ever party BUT\u2026\n\nThe frat boy who lived in the party house lived there with his parents and he threw the party when they were out of town. Apparently the family was already having problems but when they returned home to see that their house was absolutely destroyed and also cover in bodily fluids, His parents decide to get a divorce as this is their last straw. \n\nUnfortunately I\u2019m not done. Neither of the parents want him so he goes to live with his Grandpa. \n\nHis Grandpa died 3 weeks later and he became homeless for 7 months.\n\nI also gained the nickname garlic poop vomino effect chick. (vomit+domino=vomino if you didn\u2019t get it) \n\nI never went back to that school and I will never live it down.\n\n(Also apologies for any misspellings or poor grammar i\u2019ve been awake for 38 hours)",

      "selftext": "Edit: sorry I forgot the TWs - self harm, depression, SA\n\nToo tired to do the song and dance, so if you want the rundown, it's on my account.\n\nI think I just desperately need to write this out. We went NC with the whole of my side of the family about a month and a half ago aside from my other sister (not Clara).\n\nDecker has been in therapy, and frankly, so have I and Honey both individually and a bi-weekly couples therapy session. A lot has changed.\n\nI didn't realize how much the abuse I suffered at the hands of my uncle really affected me. His reaction to Decker never bothered me or really had a stake in my emotional or mental state, but more that my mother made me forgive him and be polite when he was around. It's always been that way. I was the eldest, so I turned the other cheek until I had no cheeks, then I turned the old ones. I was never really permitted to have negative emotions or get angry. \n\nThis situation with Clara blew a lot of dust up, and Honey and I started to have issues. She noted how reserved I tend to be, and even with her, I struggle with asking for what I want or expression displeasure. I shut down or deflect. It sucks to learn this about yourself when the rest of your world is falling apart.\n\nClara was arrested for my assault and ended up doing a mental health program for a month rather than getting a conviction - as such, her record is clean of that from what I  understand. It was hard cutting her and the others off. My other sister was the one keeping me up to date on everything. Clara got out a while ago.\n\nShe's been trying to get in touch every way she can. She got a new number, email, Facebook, even tiktok. She's written and mailed numerous letters. I am exhausted because I hate cutting everyone off. It's so isolating always having my siblings around and now only really having one sister so suddenly is really lonely.\n\nI focus on Decker and Honey. Honey seems happier overall. She's dancing in the kitchen again, is more affectionate with me, and is more excited to go out and do things. And Decker is also happier. We've focused less on her grades and praise her more for her sense of kindness, her stick-to-it attitude, and more. She's more open with me in particular. \n\nShe talks about crushes and friends more now, shares about the intricate life of a teen. lol it's really very cute.\n\nI'm not so okay, but my family is safe and happy, which is what matters.\n\nClara's fiance Kevin reached out to me 2 days ago. Clara has been released and has been out for a week or so it sounds like, but she still has outpatient rehab to do. It's encouraged for her to have family and to be supported, Kevin says. And he says she isn't doing well. She's started talking about self-harm. And she confided in him that the same uncle that abused me, abused her.\n\nHe's begging me to talk to her and help her through this. He keeps reminded me of how she was before all this and how close we were. Calling what we were close may be incorrect, because based on what I'm learning, our relationship was toxic from the start. I was an enabling sister to a manipulative and narcissistic one. I held my ground and spoke to Honey, who agrees I should keep NC and block Kevin and simply rely on my other sister for info. \n\nBut I can't help but feel guilty. I wish Clara well. But I can't risk cracking the door open and risk the well-being of my family. I think I just feel alone. I know I can't have her in my life anymore. It just hurts. \n\nSorry for the delay in update. And to those who have been gentle or at least firm but fair with me in my private messages, I thank you. There was never a manual on how to be a good wife or mother, and I have lived an existence of feeling so out of my depth. I appreciate the support.",

But when I give the advice they seek for, oh I\u2019m wrong for telling the truth. Exactly like my sister, my sister marriage isn\u2019t perfect. Op(25F)\n\nMy sister (34F) is someone you would call who has no sense of mind, she\u2019s been with her husband (40F) for 11 years now and it\u2019s been pretty rough. They have two girls together and one on the way, they don\u2019t get along but they\u2019re still together. My bil cheated on my sister many times but she took him back because his sweet nothings did something to her, he cheated on her with a 19 year old(gross man) she found away to blame the women. \n\nAnytime he would cheat she would call crying asking me what should she do and I didn\u2019t beat around the bush. I told her the truth, she needs to leave him and don\u2019t stay for the kids. \n\n\nShe finds a way to get mad at me and hangs up, from that I told myself to not engage with her business anymore. With anyone, if anyone came to me for advice I would just mind my business. Now here we are dealing with the same problem again, my sister called to tell me her husband was talking to another woman and she doesn\u2019t know what to do. This was a cycle and I need in the end she would blame me and take him back, I told her to stop calling me about his cheating if she won\u2019t leave. Aita?",

      "selftext": "UPDATE: I cancelled the internet as it was in my name. My mother called my father today, and asked to speak to me. She has been begging my father to convince me to come back home. My father told her off for being a shitty mother. I told her that I want coming back. She is also angry that I cancelled the internet. She was also begging me for more money. I told her no. My mothers side of the family called me an ungrateful daughter and that I should be blessed my mothers only life. I am NC with most of my mom\u2019s family for a reason. \n\n\nMY OTHER POST IS DOWN HERE FOR ANYONE TO READ INCASE OF CONFUSION: \n\nI 18(F) graduated Highschool last year. I have a good job now as a CNA. I graduated highschool early at age 17! I was living with my mother until this situation yesterday. I am now staying with my real dad until I am able to move in to my new apartment. The apartment isn\u2019t available until December 21st of 2024.\n\nI have four siblings who are 15, 13, 11, and 9. My mother married my stepfather then I was 1. My younger siblings are from her and her stepfathers relationship. My mother is a neglectful mom. She allows her husband to mistreat me. Her husband has hit me, spat on me, shoved me, and stolen from me time and time again. \n\nThe rules in the house are that I pay 400 a month in rent, for a small bedroom. I have to buy and eat my own food, I have to pay the internet bill, which is 100$. Even though I PAY RENT, I am not allowed to lock my doors, I\u2019m not allowed to lock the door in the bathroom, I\u2019m not allowed to use the internet after 6 pm, EVEN THOUGH ITS IN MY NAME, and I pay the bill. I\u2019ve been respecting their rules. Recently I bought a new computer, I am containing my studies. I am starting school for medication aide. When I finish school I\u2019ll have a medication aide certification, on top of the CNA liscense I have, after medication aide courses are complete for me, I am going to take phlebotomy. The laptop I bought was 350$, and that was because it was on sale! \n\nYesterday my stepfather demanded more money from me after I paid all the bills required of me! He is a drunk, he has a drinking problem and my mother enables him. They neglect the kids they have. They always go out to eat, drink, and my mother always has her nails and hair done but \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the money\u201d to take care of her kids. As a result I\u2019ve been taking care of them. I told him that I wasn\u2019t giving him anymore money! \n\nThis was early yesterday morning. I went to work and came back later in the day. I went into my room and noticed my door was open, and my room got trashed. My laptop was gone. I asked my siblings if they had seen my laptop. They said no. I went upstairs and asked my mother if she\u2019d seen it. She said, \u201cWell (stepdads name) sold it to the pawn shop because he needed money for household expenses.\u201d\n\nAt this point I was livid because I needed that laptop for school. I said, \u201cI paid all of my required expenses for the house. He had no right to take that laptop that I had.\u201d Basically she said that it\u2019s their house their rules, and that if I didn\u2019t like it I could leave. I called my father, and asked him if I could stay with him until December 21st. My dad, being the rockstar he is, let me stay with him. He\u2019s not charging me rent or utilities! \n\nEarly in the morning today. I went down to the magistrate to press charges. I reported him to the police for his past violent behavior, and for the theft. I blocked my mother and stepfather on everything! I reported my mother and stepfather to CPS for neglect and to report a dangerous environment! A few hours after, my mother called my dad furious, she said, \u201cShe reported my husband for simply needing money. The police came to our house and arrested him\u201d The area I live in my country, they take theft or any crime for that matter, very seriously. I\u2019m surprised they arrested him so fast! I\u2019m wondering if CPS is as quick. \n\nAlso for clarity: My mother was stupid enough to admit his crimes through text messages. I showed the police and magistrate the messages. \n\nAITAH? I feel bad for my siblings, I don\u2019t want them to go to foster care, but at the same time they live in a dangerous environment! \n\n",

      "selftext": "AITAH for being distant from my family to avoid lice?\n\nI\u2019m 13 years old and live with my dad full time. He moved his girlfriend (Lauren, age-32) and her kid (name- Kenna Age-6) into our house 1yr into their relationship and they have been living with us for 2 years now. I really didn\u2019t mind them being around that much at first until the whole lice thing. It all started when after they moved in and Kenna asked for me to sleep in her bed with her because she was scared and did not want to be by herself. A few days after I had slept in there I noticed I had lice and told Lauren so she would treat Kenna\u2019s hair. I treated my hair and Lauren treated Kenna\u2019s and I didn\u2019t sleep in there again. After a few weeks and her second treatment I figured the lice was gone and played tag with her when she asked and surprise I have lice again. This kept going on for 2 months, Lauren would say the lice is gone, id believe her, then get lice again. Eventually I just stopped playing with Kenna and kept my distance. I would check Kenna\u2019s head every week when Lauren treated her hair and it seemed like it wasn\u2019t getting any better, there were LAYERS of nits all throughout her head and after 1 year of them living here I could see them crawling on top of her head. She has had lice for 1 whole year now. Just so you can get a visual, an example is when me, Lauren, Kenna, and my dad were on our way to the beach, Kenna was sitting on a white towel beside me in the backseat and there was what looked like black dots all over the towel and when i took a closer look IT WAS LICE and they were literally falling off of her and were all over her clothes. It stayed like this and I kept keeping my distance and wouldn\u2019t sit on any furniture except for my bed. anyways, now that u know how it started and how bad it is, Fast forward to now, we moved a few weeks ago and she STILL HAS LICE AFTER 2- GOING ON 3 YEARS. Lauren has lice, Kenna has lice, my dad most likely does since him and Lauren sleep in the same bed. Its actually so bad that when Kenna went to school one day the whole class had a lice check and when the nurse saw Kenna\u2019s head she called dss for neglect.. The only person in this house without lice is me and i have gotten it from them about 6-7 times. I wont hug anyone in my house, wont sit on any furniture in the house that isn\u2019t my bed, and wont even touch anybody. This is starting to piss them off and they think I\u2019m having an attitude when they go to hug me and I turn or when I say no every time Kenna asks to play, even though I have explained why i am doing this. I can still, to this day, see lice crawling on top of Kenna\u2019s hair and see layers of nits, it literally looks like someone sprinkled salt on her head and it freaks me out. Lauren says her and Kenna don\u2019t have lice and the eggs i\u2019m seeing are just dandruff and hatched eggs that wont come out of her hair even though they both violently scratch their heads 24/7.. like what\ud83d\ude2d I get anxious every time I accidentally get around them with my hair down and will comb my hair with a lice pick for hours to make sure i don\u2019t have lice again and go into a full panic whenever my hair does itch. My hair is about waist length and is healthy and i\u2019m tired of having to treat it continuously when i get lice because it creates so many more flyaways and split ends than i already have and all I want is a beautiful head of hair, free of lice. I\u2019m actually starting to hate it here and I\u2019m to the point where i want to shave my head. anyways, AITAH for being distant from my family to avoid lice?",

I saw 2 dogs on there that really stuck out to me, so I commented on both posts (from different posters) asking if the dogs were still available\n\nPost 1 that I commented on https://www.reddit.com/r/rescuedogs/comments/1h4ewfy/we_need_someone_to_take_this_guy_soon_found/\n\nPost 2 https://www.reddit.com/r/rescuedogs/comments/1h4nhjj/adoptionrehoming_stray_advice_tx/\n\nBoth users seemed friendly and both told me to dm them. I tried, but it wasn't working. Maybe because my account was brand new? I explained to both that I could not dm them for some reason, and they reassured me that it was fine and said they dmed me instead. However, I still could not see their messages\ud83d\ude2d during this time, I went down a sort of rabbit hole in r/rescuedogs and was saddened to see just how many dogs were being euthanized each day. I commented on a few other posts, like on one I said \"Oh no! I would take her but I'm in NC. Praying he gets a good home soon\" and on another post I asked if the dog was still alive. (luckily she was adopted before she was euthanized\u2764\ufe0f) For whatever reason, after I had made these comments, I heard back from the OP of the second post. I had just told this OP about how i still didn't see their message, they responded \" No worries, NC is too far and I don't think you are serious anyways\" I was slightly taken aback, but I understood, after all, I couldn't drive to Texas, especially during the holidays, so why should I expect them to? I deleted my comments inquiring about the dog in post 2 so the other person I had contacted in post 1 would know that I was only interested in their dog, and that the other one was not an option anymore. However, I started to get annoyed when OP of post 2 went so far as to talk to me on post 1. Post 2 OP said \"What are you trying to do here? You have commented on multiple posts, including mine, and then deleted your comments when called out\" by now I was getting a little bewildered and annoyed, so I asked them \"what did you call me out on?\" They did not respond, so I then went back to their post and under their comment saying \" No worries, NC is too far and I don't think you are serious anyways\" I asked \"why not just say that in the first place then?\" They replied saying \"What are you even replying to?\" I then tried to clarify \"I was wondering why you said \"dm me\" when I first inquired about the dog, if NC was too far. Why not just tell me you couldn't drive that far? Also, what implied that i wasn't serious?\" Post 2 OP then replied \"You need to seriously stop fucking around and quit messaging me. You know exactly what you did. Stop\" They have not said anything to me since, and I'm fine with that I tried to not take it too seriously (we are just online after all) but I feel like I am missing something about what happened. Am I really the AH? Idk what I did! Please lmk in the comments",

My dad is the only one who has a decent job; the others rely on him for their daily expenses (this is important).\n\nMy grandpa lost his battle with cancer a week ago, and the whole family is distraught and sad. I stepped up to buy all the groceries for the funeral, which cost 2.6k. My dad gave me 800 for the wet ingredients. I used 2.6k of my own money, and the 800 was from my dad. In our culture, funerals last at least seven days: three days for every relative to view the body, the burial on the fourth day, and rosary prayers on the fifth to seventh days. During this time, villagers often give donations to the family.\n\nFrom the first day to the seventh, I prepared, cleaned, and cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The other family members only did minimal chores, like cutting onions and washing dishes. I busted my ass for seven days, with no time to grieve. I felt it was my duty, as the oldest daughter and grandchild, to step up while the rest of the family grieved.\n\nYesterday, as I was relaxing in the living room, my dad brought up the topic of donations. He said the total amount collected was 10k and that he had already split it five ways among his siblings and grandma. I asked him if I could claim the 2.6k I had spent on groceries. To my surprise, my dad said, \u201cWhat for? I never asked you to buy anything.\u201d\n\nI was livid. I replied, \u201cI did that because none of your siblings tried to help with the groceries for the funeral, and I cleaned and cooked for seven days straight.\u201d He shot back, \u201cI never asked you to do any of that,\u201d and gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the night. My mom tried to intervene, but my dad dismissed everything she said.\n\nThis morning, he tried to pay me back 1k, but the way he handed it to me made me feel like a beggar. I hate being treated that way. I told him to keep the money and said I would never help with anything again.\n\nNow, we\u2019re no longer on speaking terms.

      "selftext": "hello! before I get into this I want to clarify that my English and grammar may not be the best, English is not my first language but I will try my best to  make it make sense.\n\n I know the title is a bit confusing but let me explain. I 18f have been dating my boyfriend 18m for a year and a half. \n\nfor some background, before I met my boyfriend I was dating this guy named Matthew(fake name).  I grew really insecure from my relationship with him because of multiple things he would do such as looking at other girls, liking other girls posts in bikinis, talking about how fine other girls are and how they have nice butts. Matthew would also create fake accounts to stalk his ex and was obsessing over her our entire relationship without my knowledge. I found this all out after we broke up and that he had just been using me to make his ex jealous or maybe get her attention? he wanted to post me 1 week into us talking not even dating, which is what makes me suspicious. also another factor in our relationship that may seem irrelevant but is would be the way he treated me. although he was looking at other girls all the time and obsessing over his ex, he would go through my following and snapchat to make sure I wasn't following any boys and I wasn't allowed to be friends with other guys. he wouldn't let me tutor my guy friend and got mad at me and would threaten me by breaking up then self deletion and threatening to tell my parents we were dating (I wasn't allowed to date), and he would justify his behavior by saying that his ex had cheated on him.\n\nwith all that being said, I can see those behaviors in my past relationship rubbing off on me. I am really insecure, I hate when he looks at other girls in real life or even on TV or like really pretty celebrities that he obviously will never be with. people say they don't care if their partner looks at other people and finds them attractive but I personally can't handle it. I feel terrible and will act out towards him. I don't let him look at other girls (he respects this) but he says he doesn't anyways because he thinks finding celebrities attractive is stupid. He doesn\u2019t have social media and that makes me relieved because i know he isn\u2019t looking at his previous interests or looking at other girls. I also don\u2019t let him have any girl friends which is also a mutually respected decision as i don\u2019t have any guy friends either. We feel that each others presence is enough and we don\u2019t have to be friends with people if he opposite sex because it makes us uncomfortable. he told me this morning that after dating me for so long, he doesn't look at people and think they're attractive because that factor isn't even in the equation anymore for him. he tells me Im the only girl he will ever find attractive and I'm the most beautiful woman he has met but I am always doubting myself. he tells me these things but I always have creeping thoughts that he does find other girls attractive and that hurts me because I don't think I'm the prettiest person and I am not so confident in myself. I only started being this way, super insecure after Matthew. after dating my current boyfriend for a year and a half, I feel like I haven't improved one bit in this aspect of insecurity in my relationship or within myself. he also enables me because yes he supports me when I act like this towards him and raise concern about him looking at other woman (which he never does) but I hate this thing about myself but I don't know how to fix it because I don't know if therapy will help and I haven't been able to overcome my low self esteem.\n\nI'm sorry the post got so long but can someone let me know if I'm being TAH for acting like this? I feel like I just become more insecure everyday for no reason and have no self esteem although he tells me I'm beautiful at least 15x a day. he swears he doesn't mind and even likes this behavior from me but I feel like this might push him away in the long run because people love a person who's confident and I just assume my boyfriend wants me to be that way.",

I dont understand my emotion.\n\n3.Last week, he was sending me to work. Other driver was being a jerk to him on the road. I was surprised but my mind went blank. I dont know how to react. So I just left for work without saying anything.\n\n4. When he picked me up, I said sorry for not saying anything earlier. He just ignore me. I tried again after few hours and he ignored me. When i get home, I settle my self first then i fell asleep. when i woke up, I approach him and said sorry again. He got mad and say that why do i have to say sorry at my convenience. Why cant i say it in the car? \n\n5. He said he is not speaking to me ever again and if I cannot live in such marriage, I can go back to my parents.\n\n6. I tried to open up and say that I also having a hard time understanding myself during pregnancy. I did stupid things. I hated it and i never want to hurt him with my action. He got more pissed off saying im just using my pregnancy as an excuse. He said, there are many woman in the world is pregnant but dont do stupid thing like me. He rolled his eyes when i open up like this.\n\n7. I said i want to work out. He said I do not have anything to offer anymore. He said I can go for a diviorce if I want. And even so things will be easier for me. Because my family loves me while him, he'll just be alone and die alone like his father. (he's from broken family). \n\n8. He is giving me silent treatment. I feel stuck, I feel helpless. I understand i made a mistake, and I want to work it out but he is shutting me down.\n\n\nAll in all, i feel i deserved this...I start to lose hope.

Just listening to the stories of obvious cons, scams, ripoffs and highway robbery is exhausting. They interrupt when I'm trying to reason with them. Instead of talking about what I want to talk about or positive things they might want to talk about, a large portion of time is given to intervention in obvious scams. Whether it's healers, naturopathic doctors, psychics or whomever else can see them and their wallet coming, it's always someone who they're going to, giving money to, to fix their many issues. They refuse any conversational means of addressing their issues, which is their right, but is very hard to watch and listen to because I'm a very empathetic person. I feel like it's taking over our relationship. \n\nNot long ago, we went to an event and they behaved very selfishly, kind of like a child or teenager might, focused on having fun and taking pictures instead of helping out because we were in charge of our own setup. I spent a lot of money on this and all I asked was a small contribution of materials and a helping hand. I haven't seen them in months since the event and in the interim they have struggled with their health. Whenever we speak, the focus is on their health and emotional challenges and the negative impacts on their life from these challenges. I really sympathize an empathize with them. I want to help in whatever way I can. Standing idle while they get ripped off isn't my style and certainly not helping them or their situation. It's getting to the point where I don't want to talk because I know what's coming. Personally, I'm also dealing with a lot. Even my therapist says so. Trying to address issues with my friend always ends up being more than they can easily handle. They really don't want to hear what I have to say about these things but that tough love.\n\nI do feel like the only solution is to put a lot of distance between us so that I can function without taking on their problems. It's hard because they have multiple diagnoses on top of as yet undiagnosed issues with their physical health. I feel drained and frustrated just from interacting with them and with all of my trauma, health concerns and my new found functional stability in the balance, not to mention my emotional well-being.\n\nAITAH for keeping my distance?

For background I was 21 living at home, my dad and I have always had a rough relationship.\n\nAnyways this happened on December 12, 2023\n\nMy family (my mom, my brother (age 3) my dad) made plans to go pick out or real Christmas tree after I got out of work at 4pm. I asked earlier that day if my bf (Age 20) could join, my parents have never had an issue with him. We all met at home and got in my dad\u2019s truck to go get the tree. Everything went fine, we got the tree, had some laughs. I literally no idea that the night was going to take such a turn. \n\nWe stop at Pizza Hut on the way home and got food to take home. We get home and enjoy the food. We get the tree screwed in the base and my mom is bending over to get the based screwed in and my brother keeps trying to jump on her back. I yell at him to knock it off. In turn my dad yells at me for yelling at him. I brush it off and start talking to my bf about some lady at work ( I worked in retail at the time)\n\nMy bf and I go watch a movie in my room (door open) my brother comes to join us. My dad comes in and grabs my brother from in between us. \n\nAbout 15 mins later my dad comes in and says my bf has to leave, (it was like 8pm) I hadn\u2019t  seen him for a while and I was upset. When he left as I was saying goodbye I was crying. \n\nHe leaves and as I am walking back to my room. I am stopped by my mom and dad, in the dining room. They tell me that I am not taking care of myself because I hadn\u2019t showered that day, that I was selfish ( I ate the last breadstick from when we got Pizza Hut) I need to take of myself, I\u2018m spending too much money. My dad then says that I can\u2018t yell at my brother like I did, and that I shouldn\u2019t have laughed after I did. I said I didn't laugh . He said you did. I said I didn't . He then stands, and balls his fists, I say if you hit me I will call the cops. He runs at me and punches me in the face. My glasses go flying. I\u2019m laying on the floor from the punch . My mom is in between us and my dad is screaming at me. I don\u2019t remember exactly what he said but I rush to my room and grab as much as i can. ( this all happened in about 10 mins fyi)\n\nI had planned on spending the night at a friend\u2019s the next night and so I had a bag packed I grab that bag, my stuff animal and a blanket. I grab my phone,and keys. I ran while he was screaming. He screamed things like \u201cYour bf isn\u2019t allowed here ever again, we will never financially support you again, you\u2019re an ungrateful piece of shit, etc. \n\nI got in my car and called my best friend. She lives down the road not even a mile. I called and just showed up, I would have called my bf but he was driving home still. I get to her house and i call my bf\u2019s mom. He just got home and she sends him right back to me. I\u2019m sitting on my best friends couch. Holding a ice pack to my face as my best friend tells me I have to call the cops, \n\nI do. They charge him with harassment with physical contact, I get told it is best that I stay away by my mom and the cops. That weekend I went to the er and I was diagnosed with a mild concussion. I also had bleeding from behind my ear from my earring going into my head when punched me.  \n\nI live with my best friend for a few months then live with a few others eventually. I was living in my car, then with my bf family then I finally got my own place. During all of this my own family cut me off because of me calling the cops CPS could have taken my little brother away. I got told many times that i should just let go what happened. And that my actions affect others. I wasn\u2019t invited to any holidays, and I\u2019m only invited to one this year even though there are 3 of them. \n\nI more to tell but I figured I would start here. Just for reference this isn\u2019t the first time my dad has hit me. ",

Since then, my mom has had to work a lot to keep us afloat, and I\u2019ve always tried to help out when I can\u2014cooking dinner, watching my brother, cleaning, etc. I didn\u2019t mind because I know she\u2019s doing her best, and I love my brother.\n\nLast weekend, my mom told me I couldn\u2019t go to my best friend\u2019s birthday party because she needed me to babysit. This wasn\u2019t the first time plans got canceled last minute because of babysitting, so I was frustrated and told her I had been looking forward to this for weeks. She said, \u201cToo bad, family comes first.\u201d\n\nSo, I ended up staying home, but I was upset and made it clear I wasn\u2019t happy about it. I still watched my brother and did everything I was supposed to, but I was kind of short with her for the next couple of days.\n\nFast forward to this week: I got invited to hang out with friends after school. My mom said no because I was \u201cbeing disrespectful\u201d last weekend. She grounded me and told me I needed an \u201cattitude adjustment.\u201d\n\nNow here\u2019s where it gets messy. Yesterday, my mom said she needed me to babysit again because her work schedule changed. I told her no. I said, \u201cIf I\u2019m grounded, then I shouldn\u2019t be trusted with babysitting either.\u201d She got really mad and said I was being selfish. She argued that watching my brother isn\u2019t a punishment, it\u2019s a responsibility, and I can\u2019t just pick and choose when to help out.\n\nI told her I feel like I\u2019m being treated like a second parent, and I\u2019m tired of always having to drop everything for her. She told me that\u2019s what family does and accused me of being ungrateful for everything she\u2019s done for me.\n\nNow she\u2019s barely talking to me, and I feel like the worst sister/daughter ever. My friends say I\u2019m not wrong for standing up for myself, but my mom thinks I\u2019m a brat. I get that she\u2019s under a lot of pressure, but I feel like I deserve to have some independence.\n\nSo, AITAH for refusing to babysit after getting grounded?",

      "selftext": "I was with my ex for 7 years. For 7 years I learnt his language, his culture, his religion and I went above and beyond for everything related to his family. I was the main earner so I had no problem paying the rent, helping his family financially during the pandemic and co signing for his car etc because his credit was terrible. I was completely in love with him and I could not have done more to be a perfect girlfriend. I even learnt to fucking cook.\n\nMain earner and home cooked meals.\n\nHis mother moved in with us and he worked long hours (so I thought) so I was often left with her because she was new to the area and knew no one. And again, emotionally and financially I did everything for her as well as everything for her dickhead son. \n\nWith his new car (that he had because of me) he wanted to go on a road trip around the country. He had never travelled much and I couldn't get the time off approved from work so he went alone. \n\nOn my birthday, he worked overtime. Christmas day he had to work. \n\nOne of his colleagues often stalked my Instagram and he told me he hardly knew her, she was just a nosy kid. My instincts told me that didn't sound right so I spent 6 months paranoid with him telling me I was crazy and jealous and that I needed therapy. Then his insults got worse and then the physical abuse started.\n\nMy friend was aware of my suspicions and she was keeping an eye on this girl's posts for me. \n\nBoxing day arrived and I was absolutely miserable after spending yet another holiday alone with his mother ( my family live in a different state) and my friend sent me a screenshot of this girl's story and in the background I could see his car. \n\nI confronted him and found out that they had been together for almost a year. She had known about me the entire time and didn't care. They went on holiday together. The money I gave him for various fines/clothes/random shit he was giving to her. His mother had known and had met her several times. He was never working long hours or overtime. He had been fired 3 months earlier and all those long days he was 'working' and I was with his mother he was actually with his other girlfriend.\n\nThis is where I'm an AH. I saw red.\n\nWhen I left,  I took his car keys, his motorbike keys, his Xbox, his games, all his ID, his comic collection (worth a lot), his clothes, every lightbulb, every shoe, every pan, every remote control, every pair of jeans and every cable in the house. \n\nSome of those things I bought, some of them I didn't. \n\nWhen he was calling me afterwards begging me to go back to him and to tell him where his things where I could only reply that I've got no idea what he's talking about, he's going crazy and he should consider therapy, exactly like he always told me.\n\nAbout a month later in a nightclub I bumped into some of his friends. That night I slept with his childhood best friend.\n\nA couple of months later I bumped into his other girlfriend. She actually tried to be nice to me and she seemed extremely interested in what I was doing/how i was doing. Obviously I had blocked them both but I was still obsessing over them on my friends account so I knew they had stayed together. As subtle as possible I said that I was doing great, we had been in therapy and we were working it out, I couldn't stay long though because I was late to meet ***  and I left before she could reply.\n\nShe thought he was now cheating on her with me and from a bit of online stalking, I knew they had split up a couple of days later. \n\nHe's now single, comic bookless with no clothes, no way of cooking, no income, with friends he cant trust, living in the dark and with no way of proving who he is\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nIf your going to reply with a negative opinion then don't bother. Like I said in the beginning I have 0 regrets.\ud83d\ude43\n",

In the beginning he was excited and wanted to be involved but during the middle of my pregnancy he switched up and turned really mean and switched up. He decided to stop helping all together and not be involved. My baby was born a week ago and he asked to be involved again and so I let him be there for the birth, and he was, but now he hasn\u2019t really asked about her or been involved. He asks about her sometimes. He just texts how\u2019s the baby? and i respond and he doesn\u2019t really show her much interest after that. He hasn\u2019t brought her anything or done much to really be involved. The thing is I don\u2019t really care anymore or care to fight to have him involved. Would I be TA if I just stop replying to his messages and keeping him involved? I still have him on social media and all he posts about is going on dates with multiple girls and spoiling them with gifts and money, but doesn\u2019t for his own daughter. I myself had a dad who was there but wasn\u2019t really there if that makes sense and i don\u2019t want her to go through the same thing. I rather her not grow up with him at all if he\u2019s just going to be coming in and out of her life whenever he feels like it and not showing much interest when he is involved. it feels like he regrets being a father and doesn\u2019t want to be one so i\u2019d rather let him off the hook and just raise her myself and let him find someone he actually wants to be a family with than fight for him to be involved in my babies life.

Now I've asked my gf multiple times to distance herself from this guy - but the issue is she's worried as, he's always part of the group and if she doesn't meet them, they'll start distancing her out of the group.

      "selftext": "My (m30) ex gf (f27) and I had been together for a year and a half officially. It was amazing in the beginning. I legitimately thought I had met my soulmate. We had moved in together with plans for the future, and I started to realize a lot of the things she had talked about were actually either not true or only half true. \n\nShe started going through my phone, finding nothing as I was undyingly loyal to this woman. She lied about it profusely until she couldn\u2019t deny it any longer. She claimed I had emotionally cheated on her (I didn\u2019t, had I she would have absolutely confronted me about it). \n\nThe week she moved in she got drunk and was being sad and I tried many ways to pick her up. She wouldn\u2019t do it, and was being avoidant. I told her she might want to just stay with her mom for the night. This caused her to get up and start screaming, she came at me and punched me in the chest multiple times. I extended my arm to get her away from me, grabbing her neck which I immediately let go of because I didn\u2019t want to hurt her. She responded by saying I was trying to kill her and three pieced me in the face busting my lip and hurting my jaw. She proceeded to go into the kitchen and absolutely destroy it. I wouldn\u2019t let her leave at that point because she was both drunk and in complete emotional disarray. \n\nI cleaned it all up. She apologized the next day and I told her that was her first and only strike. I have never been violent with my partners and don\u2019t even like raising my voice.\n\nSome months went by and then we had gone out shopping one day. She said she didn\u2019t like the store we were in, and we left. I was irritated but chose not to talk the whole way home. We get home and I mentioned I thought it was silly, and she became very angry, slamming our bedroom door multiple times until I pushed it open to get her to stop. She pulled my painting (about 4 foot tall) off the wall and swung it at the wall as hard she could breaking it into a million pieces. I told her she needed to leave for the night, which she wouldn\u2019t. Had to call the cops, they gave me the option to send her to jail and I decided not to press charges because I loved her and thought we could work it out. \n\nShe eventually said that she was \u201cjust trying to get away from me\u201d and it was \u201creactionary abuse\u201d which, to me, sounded a lot like \u201cit\u2019s your fault I hit you/destroyed your shit.\u201d She moved out the next two days while I was gone at work. I had changed the locks (she took a bag of stuff with her when she left that morning) because I didn\u2019t want her to take my shit or break anything else, and she snuck in the house thru a window and did exactly what I thought she would do. \n\nImmediately (within 3 days) after we broke up she started seeing someone I used to be close to and a colleague of sorts in my line of work. I ended up finding out she had said some pretty defamatory things on social media about me that were not true the day after we split. I have been in therapy for weeks since it happened and it\u2019s been super hard on my mental health. From her immediately finding someone else, to beating me, to breaking my things, and blaming it all on me.\n\nJust recently I started telling my side of things when I\u2019ve been approached about it. We have some friends in common, and they wanted my side of things. One of these people were that colleague. She messaged me telling me I needed to stop lying about everything and she missed me a lot. I haven\u2019t lied about anything, I also have kept pretty good track of everything that happened. \n\nA lot of the people I have told have been kind of blown away by my side of things. Some have really questioned their friendship with her. The worst part, to me, is the double standard. Had roles been reversed there would be no trial or \u201chearing me out\u201d, I would be an outcast in the community immediately. It\u2019s insane to me that people have needed to take a minute to gather their thoughts on this situation. To me, it seems pretty cut and dry this person is a danger to themselves and to those around them. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling people my side of the story? Should I just hope she does better and gets passed this behavior? I have it on good authority that she has done this to multiple other partners, and she had me block all of her exes as they were \u201ccrazy.\u201d",

      "selftext": "EDIT: meant to put slap, not hit in the title and reddit won\u2019t let me edit that part for some reason.\n\nMy husband (25M) has always had this habit of poking, grabbing, slapping, or hitting my butt or private area. (Never too hard or painfully though). I usually do not mind it nor care because I know that\u2019s how he displays his affection sometimes. However 6 days ago, I gave birth to our first child. Long story short, I had a 2nd degree tear and needed stitches and I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s incredibly painful as is. Sitting down, peeing, wiping etc feels like burning torture and I\u2019m still very sore. After 4 long nights of barely any sleep and finally getting our daughter to sleep and stop crying at a normal hour, I was totally exhausted and planned to go to sleep myself. My husband offered to have sex, I told him we can\u2019t have sex until 6 weeks. He thought it was 6 DAYS after birth that you can have sex so he got really annoyed and kept trying to tell me it\u2019s \u201cunnecessary\u201d and I don\u2019t need to wait that long. I kept telling him no over and over and once he finally let it go, he kissed me and then he did his signature vagina grab-and-slap that he does every time. I absolutely jumped and screamed and almost fell to my knees from the burning pain after. He asked what was wrong with me and I told him he can\u2019t do that anymore because I have literal stitches there. \n\nI never realized how naive and sheltered my husband was when it comes to knowing anything about childbirth because he literally had the nerve to say \u201cyou\u2019re lying, why would you have stitches there\u201d. I then had to explain to him, while I\u2019m sitting there is agonizing, soring pain that my vagina literally tore apart from our daughter\u2019s head trying to come out. He literally standed there, seeing me crouched on my knees, holding my cooch, sobbing in pain and instead of deciding to help me or AT LEAST apologize, went on to say \u201cWhat do you mean it tore apart? How is that possible? It\u2019s literally made for babies to come out of\u201d. I screamed at him and called him an idiot and told him to go away. He left without helping me up or checking on me and was just mad that I called him an idiot and screamed at him.\n\nIt has now been 4 hours and I iced myself down there, laid down for a little and I feel slightly better now. However he\u2019s ignoring me, giving me dirty looks and told me I am being overdramatic and that \u201cthe whole world has had babies, why is it his fault my p***y doesn\u2019t work right\u201d. I told him almost every first time mom tears during child birth and he\u2019s not having it. He thinks I\u2019m just lying and being dramatic and selfish so I can take out my stress on him and have an excuse to not have to have sex with him (Like\u2026.what?). He can\u2019t comprehend that he caused me awful pain and didn\u2019t even bother to at least say \u201csorry I hurt you\u201d. He then asked ME to apologize for screaming at him and calling him an idiot which I refused to do.\n\n\nI need to know if I\u2019m actually being overdramatic and should apologize. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt his feelings and call him an idiot, but It hurt REALLY, REALLY bad. But AITA?",

I was already annoyed this weekend by him instinctively closing the bathroom door which caused it lock on the other side and not being able to open it which made me stay late to the night while im supposed to sleep early for the SAT test on Dec 7th. He was laughing and took a picture for snapchat when it happened as i was struggling to open it because the toilet had all my toilet equipment from toothbrush to my deodrant and perfume which made me stink and and uncomfortable going to the SAT because i had to wait till tomorrow for a locksmith to open it for me and the landlord didnt gave us keys for the bathroom.\n\nSo today on my way back from the library he asked me to get the cash for his part of the rent, I asked him to transfer the money to my account then i will do it. He didn't transfer all of the money and told me to pay the rest in which he would give me later. I was concerned that i might forget or he won't pay the remaining dollars back. The ATM was closed on Sunday so i had to walk back to the apartment and i transferred back the money he gave me. Later today as i was making lunch for myself, he said that im the greediest person he ever saw and that he wanted to slap me. It irritates me because i had my suspicion and didn't want to be used and asked the question just as an assurance and because of the bathroom door issue having concerns about him. I have to stay with him till May 1 when i come back to my home country.\n\nAITA for being suspicious of him not giving me the full amount which made him mad? was there a better way to approach this situation because i find weird that him calling me a greedy person is taking that toll on me and feeling bad.",

I want a relationship, but Jack has made it clear he\u2019s not ready.\n\nWhen we hang out, it\u2019s usually at night because of my late work hours. I don\u2019t mind that he mostly drives us around or works on his truck or bikes\u2014I value quality time. Now we just park and make out, but I\u2019ve told him I only want further intimacy in a committed relationship. Jack brushes this off, saying it\u2019s \u201cexpensive to drive into town\u201d and he wants to \u201cmake the most of it.\u201d (meaning, while he's in town\"\n\nAbout two weeks ago, I told him I didn\u2019t want to see him unless we were officially dating. He called that unfair and said I should respect his decision not to be in a relationship. He\u2019s also very emotionally closed off and won\u2019t share how he feels or what he wants, which makes communication one-sided.\n\nWhat bothers me most is that he often messages me wanting sexual content. He doesn\u2019t ask for explicit photos\u2014but videos of me moving my tongue or sticking it out.\n\nI was finally done and asked to speak in person, which meant me driving out to where he lives. I was with my friends at the time as we were going on a walk and I was going to meet with him after. He said \"OK, i'll come I just need to help my friend first.\" Anyways, 30 minutes later he says he got his truck stuck on a mountain and that he probably can't make it. We walk about a mile and half down this trail when he comes riding down in his truck and drives right past me without stopping. After he was back on the road and I'm walking back down the trail annoyed, he says \"give me a minute I'm getting gas.\" I'm at my car at this point and respond \"Don't bother, I'm leaving.\" So my friends and I drive back into town.\n\nAfter that I blocked him on everything for a few days, but I gave in and unblocked him. We later talked after he drove me home from the airport. I told him he was hurting me, and he finally explained why he didn\u2019t want a relationship. He said he\u2019s seen friends w/ gfs fail to follow through on commitments, and he just wants to do his own thing. But still wanted to be friends. I agreed but told him we couldn\u2019t be intimate anymore.\n\nA week later, he started up with sexual innuendos again. I admit I played along a little because I\u2019m attracted to him and hoped he might eventually see me as worth committing to. When he asked for new videos, I reminded him we were supposed to be \u201cjust friends,\u201d and he responded, \u201cFriends with benefits? Lol.\u201d\n\nLast night, he hinted again about wanting videos. I told him I was busy, and he said, \u201cSorry, I can\u2019t help myself, you\u2019re just so pretty.\u201d This kind of flattery often makes me give in, but this time, I called him a manipulator.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for calling him a manipulator? Or am I not respecting his choice not to be in a relationship?\n\n",

      "selftext": "I (18F) am from India, and like many here, my parents had my entire life planned out for me from the moment I could talk. I\u2019ve always loved literature and dreamed of studying it\u2014reading, writing, storytelling\u2014it\u2019s my passion. But to my parents, that was never an option. They were set on one thing: I was going to be a doctor. No debate.\n\nIn 11th grade, I begged them to let me take humanities and pursue my interests, but they outright refused. Instead, they forced me to take Biology and Math, claiming it was \u201cthe only respectable choice\u201d and that I\u2019d \u201cthank them later.\u201d The next two years were hell. Between coaching classes, relentless pressure to top my exams, and constant reminders that I was \u201ccarrying the family\u2019s honor,\u201d I was miserable. Every time I tried to tell them how unhappy I was, they dismissed me, saying I was \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cjust going through a phase.\u201d\n\nWhen I finished 12th grade, I turned 18, but I hadn\u2019t cleared NEET (the medical entrance exam). Honestly, I didn\u2019t even want to clear it. Medicine was never my dream, and they knew it. I thought this might finally make them realize that this path wasn\u2019t for me. Instead, they escalated.\n\nOne evening, they sat me down and, out of nowhere, brought up marriage.\n\nTheir reasoning? Since I wasn\u2019t becoming a doctor and, in their words, \u201cclearly wasn\u2019t serious about my life,\u201d I should marry someone who could \u201cstabilize\u201d me. They had even lined up a potential groom\u2014an older guy from a \u201cgood family\u201d who was well-off and supposedly \u201cresponsible enough\u201d to handle me.\n\nI was stunned. I couldn\u2019t believe they were giving up on my education altogether just because I didn\u2019t fit their mold. When I protested, they accused me of being \u201cungrateful\u201d and \u201crebellious.\u201d My dad said something like, \u201cIf you can\u2019t bring pride to this family, you can at least bring security by marrying well.\u201d\n\nThat was my breaking point.\n\nAfter that conversation, I secretly reached out to my maternal grandparents, who have always been more understanding. I told them everything, and to my surprise, they offered to help. They didn\u2019t have much, but they sent me enough money to get started. I also started doing online side hustles\u2014freelance writing, tutoring, and design work\u2014to support myself.\n\n\n I applied to a reputed institution for a BA in Literature, got accepted, and moved far away without telling my parents. Although this has been difficult, it\u2019s been the best decision of my life. For the first time, I feel free. I\u2019m studying what I love, meeting like-minded people, and finally building a future I can be proud of.\n\nMy parents, however, didn\u2019t take this lightly. When they realized I was gone, they freaked out. They called me dozens of times, showed up at my grandparents\u2019 house (who refused to tell them anything), and even tried to file a police report claiming I was \u201cmissing\u201d or \u201ckidnapped.\u201d The police couldn\u2019t do anything since I\u2019m legally an adult.\n\nBut last week, they found me.\n\nThey showed up at my place unannounced, furious. My mom cried and said I\u2019d \u201cruined the family\u2019s reputation,\u201d while my dad demanded that I pack my things and come home immediately. When I refused, they tried to guilt-trip me, saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re abandoning your family for a stupid hobby,\u201d and \u201cDo you even know what people are saying about us?\u201d My dad even threatened to disown me if I didn\u2019t comply.\n\nI stood my ground and told them this was my life and my decision. That\u2019s when my mom said something that\u2019s been stuck in my head ever since:\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t come back now, don\u2019t bother calling us ever again.\u201d\n\nThey left after hours of arguing, and I haven\u2019t heard from them since. My grandparents fully support me, but they\u2019re worried about the family fallout. I feel torn. On one hand, I\u2019m finally living the life I\u2019ve always wanted. On the other, I can\u2019t shake the guilt of walking away from my parents, even if they\u2019ve been controlling and unsupportive.\nThis is a burner account, my relatives know about my primary account, have seen and sent some of my posts to my parents.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to go back home and live the life my parents want for me?\n\nTL;DR: My parents forced me into a science stream and planned to marry me off when I didn\u2019t clear NEET. I left at 18 with help from my grandparents and now study literature. They found me and demanded I return, threatening to cut ties if I don\u2019t. Am I wrong for standing my ground?\n\n",

      "selftext": "Title: AITA for refusing to meet my daughter\u2019s new boyfriend and missing her secret wedding?\n\nI have a daughter who has been through an incredibly rough time with severe depression and mental health Over the past 18 months, she has attempted suicide twice. The second attempt was so severe that she ended up in intensive care on a ventilator. After that, she moved back home with us for 8 months, needing constant financial and emotional support to recover and stabilize.\n\nEventually, she managed to get a work-from-home job, found her own apartment, and started to rebuild her independence. I was so proud of her for taking those steps forward. But within a month of moving out, she met a guy. She told me he was \u201cthe ONE\u201d almost immediately.\n\nGiven everything she had been through, I wasn\u2019t thrilled about her rushing into a new relationship so soon. She has had many boyfriends in the past, and it seemed too quick for her to make such a big claim after only a month of knowing him. I told her I wasn\u2019t ready to meet him yet and suggested she give it six months. I wanted to make sure this relationship was stable and that she was in a good place emotionally before getting involved.\n\nToday, she dropped a bombshell: she secretly married this guy two months ago, after knowing him for just one month. She told me they had a private ceremony with no one else there. As her only parent (and she\u2019s my only daughter), I felt completely blindsided and heartbroken.\n\nTo make things worse, I called my own mother for support, and she told me she already knew about the wedding! She claimed she didn\u2019t tell me because she didn\u2019t want to betray my daughter\u2019s trust. But I feel so betrayed myself. If I\u2019d known, I absolutely would\u2019ve been there to support my daughter and see her get married.\n\nWhen I told my daughter how disappointed I was, she said it\u2019s my fault I missed out because I didn\u2019t want to meet her boyfriend early on. She made it seem like my hesitation to meet him meant I didn\u2019t care, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I just wanted her to take things slow and focus on herself before jumping into something new.\n\nAfter all we\u2019ve been through\u2014supporting her emotionally, financially, and in every other way\u2014this feels like such a slap in the face.\n\nTo top it off, I\u2019m also really upset with my mother for not sticking up for me or encouraging my daughter to tell me about the wedding. I feel like she should\u2019ve had my back instead of keeping such a huge secret from me.\n\nSo, AITA for setting boundaries and saying I didn\u2019t want to meet her boyfriend right away? And am I wrong to be pissed at my own mother for not encouraging my daughter to tell me about the wedding?",

I told him I was overwhelmed from doing almost all the cooking and housework on top of my freelance work, and that it wasn\u2019t fair for me to carry the bulk of everything just because I work from home.\n\nHe didn\u2019t take it well. He got defensive and said things like, \u201cYou\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing,\u201d and, \u201cI work harder, so it makes sense you\u2019d handle the rest.\u201d That really hurt because it made me realize he doesn\u2019t respect the work I do, whether it\u2019s my job or taking care of our apartment.\n\nI tried explaining that I didn\u2019t mind helping more but that I wasn\u2019t willing to keep doing everything. Instead of meeting me halfway, he doubled down, saying he shouldn\u2019t have to change anything because he\u2019s the one who \u201cpays more of the bills.\u201d That was the final straw for me.\n\nI realized I deserve a partner who sees us as equals and who\u2019s willing to put in the effort to make things fair.

Over the years, I\u2019ve adapted, made excuses, and convinced myself it\u2019s just a phase. But the past year has pushed me to my limits.\n\nWe transitioned into a long-distance relationship (LDR) as she\u2019s finishing her studies and I\u2019m working a demanding job. Despite my packed schedule, I\u2019ve been there for her, especially during her placement season. I stayed up late, helping her through the stress, even though I had my own challenges\u2014my job and exams.\n\nWhen she finally got placed, I playfully asked if she\u2019d introduce me to her parents. Her response shook me. She said I wasn\u2019t \u201cpresentable enough\u201d because I earn less and has fewer qualifications than her. She apologized later, but it stayed with me.\n\nThe next day, I went on a short trip\u2014a rare thing for me. She bombarded me with calls, accusing me of being unavailable and saying she was \u201cbetter off single.\u201d It hurt, but I let it slide because that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been.\n\nThen, something happened that broke me. I called her later that day to share devastating news about a serious medical condition one of my parents is facing. Instead of support, she lashed out\u2014abusing me while I was at my most vulnerable. That was it. I broke down.\n\nThe moment she realized I wasn\u2019t my usual \u201cchill guy\u201d self, she switched. She begged me not to leave, apologized profusely, and promised to change. But this isn\u2019t the first time. It\u2019s a pattern\u2014anger, guilt, promises, repeat.\n\nI\u2019m torn. I\u2019ve loved this woman unconditionally, but I\u2019m exhausted. Every part of me wants to believe she\u2019ll change, but how many more chances can I give without losing myself?\n\nShould I leave and prioritize my peace, or should I give her one last chance?\n\nEdit:\nAs many of you have pointed it out, it\u2019s high time to end this relationship. I will end it once I speak to her\n\n",

G has another friend, K, who joined my old school after i left. ive met K before, but they havent been very good times. the first time, G poured water all over me to make K laugh. its a pattern i have noticed: G will meet someone new, and will turn me into the butt of every joke to impress them(?). G moved to another town in May, meaning it became more difficult for me to see her (my mom works 2 jobs and my dad is disabled). although ive tried many times, the plans we make fall through. but on the days that we were supposed to hang out, i end up finding out that G is with K. \n\nin around august/september, things got very hard for me. im in all honors classes this year + precal + AP Lit Comp, as well as having to deal with losses in my family in such close times together. during this time, G made no effort to reach out. i texted her and told her that i did want to see her, but she then blew up at me stating \"i wake up at 6 for school, go to college from 1 to 4, and then go to work until 10. i feel like everyone just expects me to drop everything to talk to them.\" for a little more context, she does cosmetology for her college course. i told her i didnt expect that, but at the same time, i didnt understand how she could make time for everyone but me. she also began completely ignoring me. for hours she would leave me on delivered, while changing her notes on instagram (you literally have to go to dms to change your note, which made me know this was intentional.) she would also make tiktoks about how bad of a friend i was for not seeing her side, but i do. G has a problem with not communicating, and instead throwing subtle shade through what she posts, but yet she preaches communication. her biggest ick in her last relationship was that her ex didnt communicate, but what she doesnt realize is that she is the exact same way.\n\nin october, she finally started talking to me again, but it wasnt the same. she is colder now and our bond isnt the same. she still calls me to talk about her boy struggles and her work problems, but never really asks about me. i havent heard a \"how are you?\" from her in such a long time. now, ive started leaving her on delivered and opened, and not responding to her calls. she hasnt received it well though, and is taking offense to it. its annoying to me how she has these double standards, but it seems to me that she doesnt recognize that the double standards are there.\n\ni dont want to not be friends with her, because she practically knows everything about me starting from 1st grade. i just wished she saw my side of things and its making me want to pull away.\n\nAITA?",

Betty and Jim are married and like many, they hit some rough patches during and after covid. About a year or two ago Betty started spending a lot of time with a male friend, Carlos. So much so, that it almost felt like they were dating. Carlos would hold Betty's hand, put his arm around, and always tough her - like if they sit next to each other his leg or hand is always on her. When I asked what that was all about, she laughed it off and said he was just a really good friend that she would tell him to cool it. \n\nThis weirdness continued and about 3 months later she proceeds to tell me that her relationship with Carlos is not physical, just emotional and that she's in a QRP. And I was quickly informed that it was not a throupple. Betty said Jim was supportive of it, but I have my doubts. Jim is a really nice guy and wouldn't want to lose Betty. Betty has a history of taking on \"projects\". In many ways it is great - because she helps people during difficult times when they have no one else, like divorces and job losses. So, I figured Carlos was just another project. Betty gets very defensive when I point that out.  \n\nWhen I talked to Jim about it, he said he was cool with Carlos. But I see Jim bristle when the guy is in the room.\n\nSo, Betty, Carlos, and I are working on a show together and now I have to watch this behavior up close. I've noticed it doesn't happen when Jim is around, but I do see it in front of her kids and other people - LOTS of other people.\n\nAITA if I tell her again to stop with the PDA if she's still married to someone else? Maybe I am too traditional, but this feels shady and makes me feel gross whenever I have to watch Betty and Carlos cavort like a bunch of teenagers in school. ",

About 2 weeks ago I saw this really cool Hot-wheels racing track at a flea market for $3. It was in great condition and I cleaned it up very well to the point you wouldn't even realize where it came from. I got it because my Niece loves hot wheels cars but doesn't have any good 'racing track' as she calls it. Well when she opened her gift from me she was ecstatic. She finally had a figure 8 racing track for her cars. I was so happy that she liked the gift. Well towards the end of the party my sister approached me and asked me where I got the track and if I had a receipt for it. (She knows my situation and knows I don't have much money at the moment). I told her I got it from a flea market and tried to explain myself but she insisted that I should not have gotten her daughter anything if it wasn't brand new, because \"A second hand toy is not a gift, it's a burden\". This blew my mind as we grew up below the median income line but she has been fortunate to have a well off husband and good career. Anyways I guess I'm wondering if that is the case now?

      "selftext": "I (39F) have 2 kids with my ex husband (45M) who cheated on me. I found out about the almost 1-year long affair in April of 2018. He was never really apologetic but played the part of pretending to try to reconcile for an extra 6 months. During that time, he continued his affair with his co-worker who was also married. \n\nI started suspecting there was something going on in January 2018 when I noticed my ex was hiding his phone, going to work early, coming home late, and talking about this woman a lot. He claimed they were good friends from work and they were in a workout group together. When I asked him about the relationship he told me I was paranoid, crazy, etc, etc. The two of them also planned family outings for us. We got our kids together to have a picnic in the park, we went to a hockey game together, she invited to me to a Saved by the Bell trivia night. The two of them worked really hard to make our families seem like family friends. But I never liked her. The first time I met her, my ex asked what I thought and I said something to the affect of \"she talks a lot.\" \n\nWe got divorced in 2019. I had to do all the work in getting a lawyer, filing the papers, and finalizing the decree. He refused to do anything. He didn't fight me on much, which is good, but only because he's incredibly lazy and fighting would have been effort. During the separation, he lived in an extended stay motel and didn't have a single overnight with the kids unless I offered to leave my home and sleep elsewhere. I was doing 100% of work after he walked out. Once we sold our marital home and finalized the divorce, he started keeping the kids on his regularly scheduled visitation which ended up being roughly 60/40. \n\nDuring the \"reconciliation\" period, separation, and divorce, she would send me long messages about how sorry she was and how she was a really good person, blah, blah, blah. I will be honest, I was not very nice to her in my responses. She blamed me for people at work finding out about the affair and accusing her of sleeping her way to a promotion (he was the hiring manager). She texted me, emailed my personal email, and emailed my work email. She was everywhere and it was annoying.\n\nThe ex and his AP got married and I am remarried. We've moved past the whole affair but I don't like either one of them. I talk to my ex about the kids and that's it. I don't speak to her at all. She's been showing up to more things and trying to start conversations. She came to my daughter's party and insisted on helping with clean up and trying to talk to me. But I don't want her help. The way I see it, her and the ex can come to the party and interact with the kids. But I don't want to have to deal with them. \n\nI had to drop something for my son off at the ex's and she was down the street walking her dog. I said \"I'm just dropping this off on the porch\" and walked to the door. I heard her and the person walking with her snickering about me when I got back in my car. \n\nThe kids have thanked me for being \"friends\" with their dad which makes me laugh because I think he's one of the biggest pieces of shit to ever walk this earth. But I know I'm not overtly rude. Just standoff-ish. But watching those two women mutter about how rude I am bothered me. As long as I'm not affecting the kids' relationship with their dad, I don't think I should be required to chat it up with two people who made my life a living hell. But is that the expectation? \n\nAITA for not speaking to the affair partner and trying to be her friend?",

So he's just staring at me as if to say \"You gonna buy them\" and I was like \"Jake, I can't I've gotta get plushies\" his faces dropped and he become irritated, his entire vibe shifted and out of no where he literally just starts going off, saying things like \"Why do you waste your money on useless shit\" and \"I'm fucking done with this stupid obsession\".\n\nI was speechless because up until now he's a sweetheart and even had encouraged my Sanrio \"obsession\", and it's not an obsession because I'm actually autistic, which he knows as well so it just adds salt to the wound.\n\nI ended up buying them because I was on the verge of having a panic attack with everyone watching, and then the second we walk out he gives me a side hug, kisses my head and tells me he loves me. I didn't know what to do or how to approach this but when we got home I asked what happened, very nicely might I add and he just started what felt like gaslighting and deflecting the situation kind of saying I was blowing it out of proportion. \n\nAnyway, his mother who I am extremely close to I sent a long message expressing my feelings over what happened and she called him later that night and tore him a new one. Now he's pissed at me, saying what I did was childish and we could've just spoken about it like adults. AITAH?",

I immediately noticed that she was sitting with a lot of other people around her, but I asked if she was alone and she said yes.  I didn't care so I started talking but it was clear that she wasn't listening and after 1.5 minutes she just hung up without saying anything. I was of course sad at first but after a little while I felt better than before so I stopped thinking about her.\n\nafter about 2 weeks I met a girl who is in her class and started talking to her. after a while we started talking about my ex and she told me that my ex had talked shit about me. I was a little annoyed by this and said that it was so childish to continue like that and that it would be better to just move on. then the girl I talked to said that my ex had been very childish and difficult in their PE class. So I said without really thinking that she had talked to me about how her friends were so annoyingly childish. but she was the same as her friends. \nafter this I didn't think about this conversation again until the next weekend when\nI met the girl in her class again. She told me that she had said what my ex had said to her friends and they had all started ignoring her. and after only a couple of days everyone knew what she had said and that no one talked to her anymore and that she was completely alone. that she cried in class because no one wanted to talk to her anymore. She is not very social or popular so she has no one else to be with anymore  \n\nI have to say that I don't like my ex and I don't want to talk to her anymore, but I don't want her to get hurt like that so when she told me this, I felt so guilty because I know that if I had just not said anything, none of this would have happened and she would be fine \n\n     ",

      "selftext": "Hello, im new to reddit and I just wanted peoples insights on my situation, so please bare with me and feel free to judge and be raw with your wordings.\n\nSo, me and my ex dated for 1 year and 4 months, but we've been talking/we've known each other for 2 years and those 2 years, we were already flirting with each other and basically committed to one another. Let's call her Blue (19) for this story since I want to keep it anonymous cs she might have reddit, (I'm 19 as well btw).\n\nFor more context, our love story ended 2 months ago mostly due to her moving to another country, we're WLW, and she's my first gf irl but not my first relationship becauce I've messed around online with people (edate) but never really irl so I'm sort of experienced with dating. We dated irl, and 6 months ago she moved to California, I'm in the Philippines and she didn't really have a choice but to go since that was her family.\n\nBefore we even became official, I was already aware that she was gonna move since she told me early on (1st month we talked) but I just never expected that time would fly by so fast and that 2 years would come by as a blur. The day she told me she was about to leave in a few days, we've already had a discussion that I might break up with her due to my trauma from LDR (Basically while I was in an ldr with my first love/the first person I committed to, she lied abt still having feelings for me and loving me even tho that wasn't what she felt and she reassured me that she did even tho she didn't so that was the reason I broke up with her, this made me develop trust issues with ldr hence why I stopped with the edating and moved to rl dating.) I even told Blue that me and her should break up while she was still here bcs I genuinely couldn't handle if she moved, but still I pushed on because the guilt of breaking up with her while she's in a new country with a new school and new sorroundings got me. I didn't want to abandon her during that situation so I pushed my trauma aside and stayed strong for Blue.\n\nIn those first few months, 1st-2nd month, I cried every night because I genuinely had the biggest trust issues I was overthinking every minute but I didn't let it affect me from loving her, and FYI I did communicate to her about all of this and she was aware the whole time.\nI stayed with her, stayed strong for her and us during those tough times, I also wanted this to be proof that I loved her. That despite me being traumatized with LDR, I still pushed on. \n\nThe LDR began to get VERY rocky, specially in the 3rd month, we broke up like 4 or 3 times because of it but got back together, my mental health was starting to get worse and I was the one initiating the break ups. I was telling her that I was overthinking more and I felt as if I don't belong in her world anymore, I didn't get reassurance for that. It honestly felt so unfair that  I kept my composure for her and stayed strong despite what I was feeling towards the situation, I was really drained but I wanted us to work so most of the time I pushed it aside. Blue was my first everything. On the 4th break up, I told her I wanted a mental health break, but realized that us not together made it worse. We were still talking atp and honestly I was relying on her for strength because I had none in me, It all got drained from trying in those first few months of the LDR. \n\nEventually, she started changing, she started pushing me away, began acting cold, distant, and all of that stuff. Despite that treatment, she said she still wanted a future with me but treated me worse than a stranger would. \n\nShe said she was acting like that in order for me to move on, and I told her that what she was doing was something I only thought of doing but never did so because I knew how badly it would hurt her and me. Yet she did it for what? \"My sake\" fucking bullshit. I told her that that's not how you love someone and she blamed her inexperience with relationships, I replied with it's common sense and doesn't require experience. I begged for her to stop and to stay because I needed her and I loved her. \n\nHonestly, it feels as if she only used me to settle in first, it felt as if she only kept me close in order not to feel alone in those first few months. Like, how can one move on so fast? (Yes she did mention that she doesn't want to try again but has said \"she still wants a future with me\") No, she's not seeing anyone else I believe. \n\nThere was the time my health was really getting worse due to staying up all night crying my eyes off, frequent headaches and I barely ate. I vomitted blood and I told her about it, I vented to her about how my health was getting worse because she said \"I could always run to her whenever something was wrong and that she would always listen\" and I did vent and rant to her twice about some family problem and other problems stacking up with led me to hurting myself, and she said I was guilt tripping her and that she wasn't my mom and that she didn't have any responsibility over me (which is true I guess ;/) so I stopped relying, messaging and stuff. But occasionally I'd lose to the desire to be with her and beg her to come back again. \n\nAnyway, we don't talk anymore, I stopped messaging her and had a 6 day streak when she suddenly apologized yesterday morning, (she never gave me a proper apology and never honestly apologized for treating me like shit) and stated it was her last message, honestly she just wanted to be in \"good terms\" because of the guilt she carried \ud83d\ude07 lol. I told her that im not gonna consider that we're in good terms and that I'd always be bitter over her but I wouldn't act on my emotions anymore. I told her I'd be waiting for her if ever decides to come back and she said to stop hoping because she's not coming back lmfao that honestly hurt but I didn't cry cs im lowkey tired of feeling things for her, but despite that I still do love her since she is my greatest love and everything, but im not hoping anymore, sure I'm still waiting but it doesn't mean I'd do bad without her, with or without her im ok. Honestly I've been doing better, I don't have the urge to message her but I still long for her and will be waiting. It might never happen and that's okay. \n\nIt ends here, If you have questions feel free to ask, and also idk if the story sounds cringe, I do acknowledge my faults like I'm the one that broke up with her and shit but it was tbh just my strength fading away and at those times I needed her to be strong for us because I was tired from fighting and she never fought for us.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: I also do need advice on how to move on she did it in under a week ",

My sis will have more people around her in the nursing home, she won't be alone.  Plus, I forgot to mention that sis, because of her disabilities is very hard to move around and get her into our house.  MIL is very frail. We'd like to have them over Xmas Eve, so we can have Xmas Day to ourselves.  My husband & I feel the same way, no problem there.

He thinks I\u2019m being selfish and says it\u2019s just a tree and it\u2019s for our son anyways and not for them. I know it\u2019s just a tree but it to me it holds a lot of memories and I don\u2019t want my son to get the wrong idea if I just give it to them to put up in their house with all of the decorations we hand picked out over the years.(yes he wants all the decorations as well he\u2019s not negotiating on just the tree) ",

      "selftext": "My (37F) husband (39M) and I have been married for 8 years. We\u2019ve always had a pretty good relationship, but we come from different religious backgrounds. I was raised in a secular household, while he comes from a Christian family. We agreed early in our relationship that spirituality was something we could discuss openly without it impacting our relationship. I respected his beliefs, and he respected my lack thereof, and we built a life together based on love, honesty, and mutual support.\n\nRecently, however, he began attending church with a couple of his friends, and I didn\u2019t think much of it at first; it seemed like a phase. But then he started changing. He became more fervent in his beliefs, and I\u2019ve noticed he\u2019s started pushing those ideas onto me. He constantly talks about his \u201cfaith journey\u201d and tries to engage me in discussions about the Bible and prayer, which I find uncomfortable. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to support him while maintaining my own views, but the more he dives into this, the more it feels like he's trying to convert me. He even suggested that we should raise future children in the church, which I vehemently opposed. I feel like a stranger in my own home, and our discussions often end in arguments. It\u2019s creating a rift between us that I\u2019m not sure can be repaired.\n\nI spoke to him about how I felt. I told him that while I respect his beliefs, I can\u2019t be part of a life that revolves around religion, especially one I don\u2019t believe in. His response was that he feels called to share the love of Christ with me, and he can\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t want to explore this with him. This conversation ended up with both of us hurt and frustrated.\n\nNow, I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m seriously considering divorce. I feel like I\u2019m losing the person I married, and I\u2019m scared of where this is heading. It feels like we\u2019re on two different paths, and the more he immerses himself in Christianity, the more I feel I\u2019ll have to suppress who I am and what I believe. \n\nI know divorce is a big step, and I don\u2019t want to be hasty, but I\u2019m also trying to look out for my own well-being. A part of me feels guilty for wanting to end it over his faith, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that this is driving a wedge between us that might be impossible to fix.",

      "selftext": "Well I (23F) and my friend let\u2019s say Emma (20F) were friends since 8-9 years ago, we were really close and we would tell each other everything, we would hangout everyday, solve each others problems together etc. So since she started dating, she would always fuck up with them and get heart broken because she liked \u201cbad boys\u201d.  She started dating someone before 2 years and she thought they would have a happy ever after relationship until the guy started abusing her verbally and kicking her out the house when he got bored of her. After they broke up, she started speaking to the current guy, they started dating by secret so the ex doesn\u2019t find out (they started dating after 2 months \ud83d\ude02) and they are still together even now. Now that\u2019s not the problem.. the problem is she pushed everyone including me and her mom for this guy, moved with him and she would only call me when she needed something or when she was home alone (cause he works and she doesn\u2019t) and whenever we disagree about something or even fight over something, she wouldn\u2019t try to make up with me and always runs to her boyfriend. So when I started noticing, I too have a long relationship, I told my boyfriend, and he told me that it\u2019s not normal to always run to your boyfriend and not make up with your friends or even stop talking to them suddenly. That\u2019s when I realised that she doesn\u2019t see me as a friend, just as a person she hangs out when she\u2019s alone. Because we stopped doing things together like before, when she visits me at home, she stays like 30 mins or 1h and then leaves cause her boyfriend is coming home, and I\u2019m always at the bottom of the list. I hated these type of girls that once hooked up with a guy, they forget their friends. So AITAH for stopping talking to her?",

      "selftext": "My brother (18m) and I (16f) have a blended family. Our mom died when we were little and our dad married our stepmom when we were 5 and 7. We have three stepsiblings (15f, 14m and 12m) and two half siblings. My brother and I are the only ones who say stepmom and stepsibling or half sibling. My stepsiblings say mom and dad for our parents and they call us their brother and sister. They also don't like to mention the half part for our younger siblings.\n\nI always used it and so has my brother. My brother doesn't have much said to him, but I do. It wasn't always true but for the last year-ish, since it was around Christmas last year this first came up, it's been an issue that I don't say mom/sibling without step before them. I asked my stepmom why it bothers her after all this time when I always had a good relationship with her and always said stepmom. She said it's the fact I don't remember my mom but I have her in a higher spot even without that relationship being present. That she understands it from my brother because he remembers mom a little bit. She said she knows we have mom's family and she loves that for us, but she wanted to hear me call her mom. She had hoped I'd want to be adopted before now and I have never shown any interest in that. She said she figured my siblings would all be full siblings. She blames my mom's family for spending time with my brother and me and never including our step and half siblings. She said if they had treated us all the same it might be different.\n\nDad told me after I talked to my stepmom that my stepmom and stepsiblings feelings are hurt. My half siblings don't care. They seem to get it better because it was always how it was for them and they hear half as a term used among some of their friends. But he said my stepsiblings feel abandoned and it's not so much about me and my brother but that it doesn't help them either. They don't have their bio dad in their life or his family and dad's family aren't a big part of our lives because they didn't want to treat my stepsiblings the same. Then my brother and I have mom's family and they never get a look in with them. He said everyone had hoped it would become more of a united family unit. He said he was a little disappointed it didn't happen for me that my stepmom became 'mom' over time and my stepsiblings would become just siblings.\n\nMy stepsiblings told me a few times they don't see me and my brother different than they see each other. That we're all equal siblings and they feel equally close to all of us. I guess I don't. I love them but my brother is the sibling I'm closest  to and we have a bond I don't have with my other siblings, step or half. \n\nMy stepmom got mad at me a couple of days ago because she found this old school project I did with a family tree and she said it sucked to be on the side of the three and to see her kids on the side, and my parents taking priority even mom who I don't remember. She said it's hard to be a stepmom who stays a stepmom even when the kid doesn't remember and can never have a relationship with the \"birth mom\". She said it's worse to think I love her but not that much.\n\nAITA?",

      "selftext": "I (31f) and my fiance (34m) have been together for a year and a half, engaged for 6 months. I have a daughter (14f), he has no kids and we don\u2019t plan on having any together. We agreed very early on in our relationship on our compromises and non-negotiables. He refuses to leave our area and his family who he has always lived near, he literally bought his grandmas house right down the street from his mom and sister. I love and respect his dedication to his family and I didn\u2019t want to be in the way of that. \nSo, we decided we would stay here and prioritize visiting my family and our time with them when they visited us. I grew up moving a lot and in/near big cities. I moved to where we are now (very rural) to take care of my grandparents until they ultimately passed and planned on leaving. The country was not somewhere I ever wanted to settle down. But I love him and I felt this was a fair compromise. I love our life and the father role he has taken with my daughter. He calls her his daughter and he has been truly wonderful with her and she loves him. \nNow, this weekend my daughter was in her schools musical and my dad, his wife, my mom and her husband drove in from where they live to see it. My mom\u2019s drive is a 20 hour drive round trip. This has been the plan for months, since the dates were announced. Last week, his nephew tells him he\u2019s stepped in to a role for a Christmas play last minute to play Jesus and asked him to come. He said yes. Originally, I didn\u2019t say anything because I thought ok, we\u2019ll just spend the morning and afternoon with my mom (dad has already left) before the play Sunday, then he\u2019ll go to the nephews play and I\u2019ll stay with my mom for my daughters last show and hang out with them after. Annoyed, but ultimately I decided to pick my battles.\nThen this morning, he tells me he has to go to his moms to bring in her dog food for her. They have no food left and he has to go asap. (He always does this, she buys the huge bags but can\u2019t carry them in because of her knees)\nSorry more context- he sold his home and moved in with me, about 30 minutes from family farm.\nI\u2019m frustrated because he\u2019s known this since Saturday and didn\u2019t tell me, and he didn\u2019t think about how that would affect time with my mom today. He slept in, and when it was time to go he\u2019s just like \u201cope nevermind, gonna spend the day up there instead\u201d. Had he told me, I would have suggested he wake up earlier to go do that so we could still spend the day with my mom before he left for the play. \nSo, I ask him to of course feed the starving dogs, but come back and spend the evening with us before my mom leaves. He says no, I told my nephew I\u2019d go so I\u2019m going. I remind him that this is extremely important to me, we see my mom a handful of times a year or less and we see his family several times a week. The kid is 15, doesn\u2019t actually care about the play he\u2019s just a last minute stand in for his friend. We start arguing and we both leave very angry with each other. Both said things we shouldn\u2019t have and we\u2019ve never gotten in a fight like this before. \nQuick facts- \nSister and nephew were driving from a night away and wouldn\u2019t be there until later in the afternoon so they couldn\u2019t take care of the dogs.\nThis is not the first time my family has been here and he\u2019s gone and spent practically a whole day with his instead \nHis mom and sister are wonderful and I am positive they would understand if he explained\n\nThis was a compromise that we agreed to and I made very clear was a hard line for me from the beginning. I feel like he is breaking his word with me and it hurts me deeply. Now I\u2019m questioning everything. Then at the same time, he sold his family home to be with me. We couldn\u2019t live there because my grandfather is disabled, plus my home is just newer and a higher value. His was very old and costing more than it was worth tbh. And then I question if I\u2019m being dramatic and overthinking. I don\u2019t know. AITA?",

      "selftext": "For honesty, my boyfriend and I are not actually married, we\u2019ve been together for about a year and a half. We both have adult children. I will be using fake names. The relevant people here are me 51F, my boyfriend Jay 47M, his daughter Emma 23F, and her boyfriend Levi 23M. Levi and Emma have been together for a year.\n\nI really like Emma, I think she\u2019s smart, pretty, kind, and confident. Her and I get along well. Levi has always been polite to me and gets on well with Jay to the point where they have spent time together without Emma.\n\nEmma and Levi just have a certain energy about them, like a power couple thing. It\u2019s clear that these are cool people, music plays when they walk in in slow motion wearing all black. I make jokes about this to Emma and she usually laughs every time, I just really think they're fun and compliments like that have never been an issue before.\n\nOn thanksgiving Levi came over, he pulled up on his motorcycle and I made a joke to Emma about how her bad boy was here. She just giggled but it didn\u2019t seem like she was upset. When he came in he looked really good, I had never seen him dressed up before and he was wearing like slacks and a nice shirt, like he just looked nice, so I told him he looked amazing and they both thanked me. We were all pretty busy all day so it wasn\u2019t until near the end of the night that I really got to talk to them, and this is where things got bad.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve been told by Jay, these are the examples of my inappropriate behavior: \n\n-Levi has the most beautiful hair I\u2019ve ever seen, and as a woman with thin, wiry hair, I am super jealous. I told him how pretty it was and I did play with it a little. \n\n-Near the end of the night I talked like an old lady about how we had so many handsome young men around this year (I listed Jay\u2019s sons, my sons, my sister\u2019s sons, and Levi) and I just so happened to be standing next to Jay and I squeezed his arm.\n\n-I sat next to Levi on the crowded couch. Him and Emma ended up switching spots anyway.\n\n-I \u201cfollowed\u201d Levi into the kitchen. I did go into the kitchen shortly after he did to get myself a drink, he had his sleeves rolled up and I made a comment about his strong arms and then I left.\n\n-I asked Levi about his tattoos.\n\n-I hugged Levi too long.\n\nEmma ended up going to stay the night with Levi, and Jay and I got into it that night because he said I was acting weird towards Levi. I did compliment him, he\u2019s a handsome young man, but I did not mean to make it weird. The next day I sent Emma a message apologizing if it seemed like I was being weird. She did not respond to the message and two days later Jay and I got into another fight about it. Over the last like week we\u2019ve been getting in a lot of arguments over it and he told me that Levi and Emma weren\u2019t the only ones that felt weird about how I treated Levi, and this is not the first time he or Emma have felt this way. Finally yesterday, I saw Emma and Levi for the first time since thanksgiving. I tried to apologize to Levi, but Emma jumped in and told me to stop, that she was tired of me being inappropriate.\n\nAfter a fight I ended up leaving, and now Jay told me he thinks we need to talk and I think it might not be a good talk. I really didn\u2019t mean to come off as I was trying to hit on him, I really thought it was coming off as more of a mom figure giving innocent compliments.",

      "selftext": "I (29F) still live at home with my parents and 2 out of 3 of my adult sisters due to low paychecks and the state of the world keeping us from moving on with our lives. I have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 6 years old, and self harm and suicidal ideation since 12. Growing up it was really hard to talk about my feelings and experiences because first of all I just couldn\u2019t put it into the right words as a child unknowing of mental health, but also being a middle child in a family of 6 I always felt talked over, invisible, or put down, primarily by my oldest sister always calling me stupid and annoying, etc. I was shy in school as well, so incredibly anxious that I didn\u2019t really start speaking in class and making real friends until I was in 11th grade. I have made so much progress in my mental health journey, and I am actually a social worker now providing counseling to K-12 students, and despite some low self esteem, it\u2019s the first time I can say that I am really good at something (it helps to have been a troubled kid in order to help troubled kids). I generally am doing fine, I of course am not in a fully comfortable place in my finances or romantically, and like any of us with life long clinical depression, I can at times feel things so much more deeply than i\u2019d like to, but most days I am quite well and committed to myself and my recovery. My issue is that when I do have momentary dips into a depressive state, I struggle so much trying to communicate with my family and it ends up making me feel so much more isolated than I\u2019d even been feeling to start. I know my parents went through hell getting me through surviving my teenage years and I owe them my life and I am extremely grateful to them and do everything I can always to help them out and be present with them, which I know they would agree with. But when my mood starts to fall in these more significant moments, it feels I am somehow doing it wrong. If I appear around the dinner table with a flat affect, despite my best efforts, everyone gets awkward and avoids me, making me shrink farther into myself and go back to being the invisible kid I was. I know many people in my family prefer to be left alone when not in a good mood, but I do prefer to be acknowledged in a compassionate way, like being pulled aside naturally and told, \u201chey it looks like you\u2019ve been going through something would you like to talk about? or just like a hug?\u201d I have had conversations letting my mother know this but I feel we are still getting it wrong someone. \n\n\nSorry this is so long winded but let me get to the example most recent to get the best advice on. I have been very depressed this past week and spent many days crying my eyes out in my room alone, avoiding more \u201cfamily time\u201d out of fear of the rejection of saying the wrong thing or being avoided. I also got too drunk on a night out recently which was very dumb as I was already depressed, and had a major breakdown that did shake my feelings of where I truly was in healing and recovery. My mom had asked at one point what was wrong and I just didn\u2019t know what to say at the moment, just depressed. Today at dinner she snapped at me for a silly mistake of throwing out the cranberry sauce and I just couldn\u2019t feign anything to hide the flat affect after that point because I just am so exhausted of being wrong. I tired to slide away and finish some washing up when she came to me and said, \u201cdo you want to talk about whatever is going on?\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say exactly, didn\u2019t want to say well I\u2019ve been crying my eyes out all week, or dive right into the most intimate of my feelings in the middle of the kitchen of how I have a crippling loneliness I fear will never end, so I thought the safest answer was, \u201cI\u2019ve just been having a sad week.\u201d She took this more accusatorially I guess and said, \u201cwell I have asked if you wanted to talk about it multiple times and you said no.\u201d Normally I go back to shrinking into myself because that felt so confrontational and that I\u2019ve fucked up again. But instead I said, \u201chow do you think that makes me feel? I am so tired of everything I do and say somehow being wrong.\u201d She said, \u201cwell how do you think it feels to hear you\u2019ve been sad all week?\u201d I wasn\u2019t meaning to be accusatory or had any ill attention in what I\u2019d said. But honestly I don\u2019t remember her giving me such an opening to really talk anyway. I tend to reply to questions like \u201chi how are you?\u201d with just \u201cfine\u201d because it doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re inquiring further, and I don\u2019t like to be asked in front of people I\u2019m not as comfortable with (such as older sister).\n\nAm I too picky and too stand offish at this point, too guarded, too presuming I will be judged that I am potentially unknowingly rejecting help I am being offered and not realizing? Am I waiting for the perfect circumstances to be heard and understood and truly seen and thus missing other opportunity? I feel so burned from having reached out for help and in fact being judged or put down or the family burden or the problem child that somewhat of a guard I feel is necessary. I like to handle absolutely everything myself to avoid being a burden and I go out of my way to help other people, especially my parents, but sometimes you do just need to reach out, but it always feels like it backfires for me. Am I giving my mom a fair enough chance to be there for me? How else can I approach her to ask for support in a way that doesn\u2019t make either of us feel ashamed or resentful. Or is my mom burnt out from having a depressed kid in her life for 29 years? Does she feel she did her time and this angst should be long gone? I promise I really do try to solve everything on my own and only reach out for help in these very bad moments, but I just need to know how I can fix this because I would love to have a relationship with my mom and my family where I can actually feel safe enough to confide in my depression and receive the support I really need sometimes. \n\nAm I doing something wrong? Am I being an asshole for being upset that no one seems to understand me still and show up for me in the way that I feel would help? Am I overly sensitive and misreading everything? \n\nMy depression is loneliness - the loneliness of rejections, being left out, never being chosen, not being good enough, always being too much but not enough, always making a mistake and failing others, always being wrong, the fear of never being truly loved because I will/have never been truly understood. Even my sadness being wrong to others hurts bad. \n\nAny advice is appreciated. I love my mom more than anything and we\u2019ve got a great relationship most of the time. Our miscommunication like this is what hurts us most, and it kills me to think we miss out on any time together even just hours by being upset. Please help me understand how I might be able to fix this. ",

      "selftext": "So sorry for the essay, I just really need to know if AITAH. My Dad\u2019s in hospital after a crush injury, he\u2019s 60 however is healthy. He broke his pelvis and shoulder, nothing else apart from bruising. He\u2019s mentally absolutely fine. \n\nThe hospital is unfortunately nearly a 2 hour drive away but we have been visiting nearly every day, I don\u2019t have much holiday left in work (half a day) so I am now going to struggle to see him. My Dad\u2019s phone was crushed in the accident however was due a new one as his contract ended, so one of my first priorities was get him a new contract, which was the plan before this happened, just didn\u2019t get round to it yet. \n\nAnyway, we sorted his phone out 3 days ago and I was relieved, my Dad was excited to have his phone soon so he can then play his games and talk to people as he isn\u2019t getting many visitors at all due to how far away the hospital is. I was excited to be able to talk to him to get updates on how he\u2019s doing rather than having to go there every single day as he\u2019s now on the mend and feeling a lot better. I would obviously still see him every other day but just takes a little bit of pressure off. \n\nSo phone is sorted, phone is delivered to his girlfriends house the next day and I was shortly going to set up his phone (as I usually always set up his phones). However, when I messaged his girlfriend to ask if the phone had been delivered, she ignored me. \n\nThe next morning, I called the hospital for an update on Dad\u2019s condition, another reason why I want him to have his phone is so I can stop pestering the nurses.. and following that I called his girlfriend to let her know what they said (he was doing well). We chatted for abit and then she goes on to say (without me asking) \u2018oh the phone has come by the way, but I don\u2019t think he should have it until he\u2019s a little bit better\u2019, straight away I got my back up. \n\nBecause why on earth wouldn\u2019t you want him to have his phone? I\u2019m trying to think of reasons on the spot why it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea and I just can\u2019t think of anything, but then I said \u2018is it because you don\u2019t want people to pester him, asking him how he is etc\u2019 because I can understand that, and if that\u2019s the case we can just tell people to leave him alone for now (although i don\u2019t think it is that, she said it wasn\u2019t that anyway\u2026) and she said \u2018no it\u2019s not that, I just think it will confuse him and I just think we should wait until he\u2019s a little bit better first\u2019\u2026 \n\nnow pause for a moment, because she was there when we were visiting him and he\u2019s asked me to sort his phone out for him, she was there when I was on the phone to his phone contract company and knew the phone would be delivered to her and I would set it up, I was there with her after, not with my Dad, on the journey home and she knows I set up the phone for my Dad for every new phone he has and not once did she mention about it being a good idea if he didn\u2019t have his phone. \n\nIt completely took me by surprise that she thought he shouldn\u2019t have this new phone yet, it\u2019s an iphone and only one up from the one he had so it\u2019s not like that would be confusing. He is completely mentally sound so I just don\u2019t understand why she is trying to control him like this. \n\nI am furious and all she kept saying on the phone was \u2018I hope you think the same as me and you understand why, I think he should set up the phone as well\u2019.. when I said \u2018I want to be able to speak to him though whilst he\u2019s in hospital\u2019, she said \u2018maybe you can get him a cheap one for now\u2019\u2026 but why! He has a brand new contract phone right there!!!!!! I just don\u2019t understand.\n\nI went to see him today and he was asking where his new phone was, I said \u2018*girlfriends name* has got it, she\u2019s coming soon so she should have it with her\u2019\u2026 they arrived and my Dad asked straight her away, \u2018did you bring my phone?\u2019 And she said\u2026.. I forgot it. And he\u2019s like \u2018you\u2026 forgot it? Awww \u2639\ufe0f\u2019. \n\nI feel awful I haven\u2019t told my Dad the truth of what\u2019s happened. I just said she has the phone, I will set it up when I have it, which isn\u2019t a lie, however she lied straight to his face. I feel like I am a weak idiot who should stand up for him and myself\u2026\u2026. But I am just lost for words to be honest. \n\nAITAH?!?!? ",

      "selftext": "My 15-year-old son recently sustained a metacarpal fracture. It\u2019s his dominant hand, too, so it\u2019s been a tough adjustment. He stayed home for a few days to recover, but after some time, he decided he wanted to go back to school. Before he did, I spoke to the school to make sure accommodations were in place. They assured me that he could type out any written work since handwriting would obviously be an issue.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEverything went smoothly with his teachers\u2014except for his maths teacher.\n\n\u00a0\n\nApparently, during class, she was writing formulas on the board and expected everyone to copy them down. My son explained that he couldn\u2019t write comfortably with his injured hand and needed to use the classroom computer. (Every classroom has one, so access wasn\u2019t an issue.) She refused. Her reasoning? \u201cYour fingers aren\u2019t in a cast, so there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t use them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, it\u2019s true\u2014he doesn\u2019t have a full plaster cast. Instead, his ring and pinkie fingers are bandaged together, and he wears a velcro wrist support. But moving his hand causes pain and he needs to rest it as much as possible. He explained this to her, but she stood her ground. She claimed that letting him use a computer would be unfair to the other pupils who were writing by hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer next suggestion? He should write with his left hand. But his left-handed writing is illegible, so that wouldn\u2019t help either. He tried to explain why these weren\u2019t realistic options, but she kept refusing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was going to need these notes when revising for his exams. At this point, a friend offered to let my son borrow his maths book after school so he could type up his notes. It seemed like a practical solution, but the teacher wasn\u2019t having it. She got angry at my son for just sitting there, even though he literally couldn\u2019t do the task the way she demanded.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe ended up giving him a detention for \u201cnot participating.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI was livid when I found out. I called the school and explained the situation to the headteacher. To their credit, they sided with me and agreed the detention was unfair. The headteacher spoke to the maths teacher and had the detention cancelled.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLater, I mentioned what happened to my sister, expecting her to agree that the situation was absurd. Instead, she said I was in the wrong. She thinks my son deserved the detention for \u201cnot following the teacher\u2019s instructions\u201d and that I was undermining authority by going straight to the headteacher. She even went as far as to say I\u2019m setting him up for failure by \u201cshielding him from consequences.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, but now I\u2019m second-guessing myself. Was I out of line for stepping in and getting the headteacher involved? Should I have made my son serve the detention?",

      "selftext": "Today I (24f) received a text from my best friend (24f) that she wanted to make a pros and cons list of her long term boyfriend and wanted my input. I was at work so it was a while before I texted back. I asked if I could call her because this was a sensitive topic that required nuance. She texted back that she couldn\u2019t call and that she already brought it up to her boyfriend. This really confused me because (in my mind at least) you don\u2019t share a pros and cons list with the person you made one of. I asked her a few clarifying questions and gathered this: she wants them both to make a pros and cons lists of each other and talk about them for self improvement and to strengthen the relationship. I see where she\u2019s coming from but still think it\u2019s a bad idea. I told her to be careful because that conversation could be really hurtful and would only work if no one took those constructive criticisms personally. Here\u2019s where I may be TA I specifically singled out her bf as the one getting hurt/defensive and asked if she thought he could handle it. I honestly don\u2019t think he\u2019s mature enough for what she\u2019s asking for and that making a pros and cons list is a way of justifying few reasons to stay in the relationship when you have too many reasons to leave. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s really ready for that conversation yet and she\u2019s not responding to my texts anymore. Even though I tried to be nice about it, I\u2019m afraid I overstepped\u2026should I have gone about this a different way? ",

      "selftext": "Before anything else, I'd like to warn anyone who happens to stumble upon this post that English is not my first languages, so I apologise for any mistake. English is a Safe language for me, to do venting.\nI made the account for this.\n\nThere's more details which I'm willing to give some if asked, but I didn't want to write a lot because I actually want to get advice.\n\nI (15F), have been mad at my father for around the last 3 years.\nThrough the start of my teenage years have came the realization that one of the things that had been fucking me up, was my father himself.\n\nFor context, I've had a few mental struggles practically since I have memory. Going from thing as subtle as moving, to Bullying and the grief of losing a close loved one. I have been working through all of this, mostly by myself. I started going to the school Therapist not so long ago. I've had just 2 sessions. But the point I'm doing my best to get better.\n\nOne of the things, as I said, fucking up this progress is My father himself. For example, through my Journey to be Clean from S.H Which is the reason I go to therapy for. He would say rude comments in a honey manner about my body hair, my weight (I'm not fat, I'm 1,55 m and weight 55 kg. But I'm still ashamed of my physical state). And I would cut over it. He would generate insecurities on me through cruel 'jokes', and then laugh about it when I got upset, stating that I was already mad. (I wasn't, I was sad). \n\nThis keeps happening and it's really taking a toll into my mental health.\n\nBut two years ago it was worse. As I said, I've faced Bullying my entire life, for different reasons. At 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 years old. Three separate cases. But this one takes place through my ages 12 and 13.\nMy father was jobless. Since he never completed middle School and he works in something we call \"Zafra\" and \"Changas\". I don't know the Word for it, but basically it's and unstable job that happens only a certain part of the year and only if an employer calls him. So, he was home ALL day. By that year, he caught a Call of Duty. . . Maybe even addiction? Let's just say he's played for hours everyday, almost every single day, for the last 3 years. Staying up late to play.\n\nNow, that year was the worst of it. He was home ALL day. He would wake up, play, only drop it to cook, and then keep playing. Mom would be working. I suspect that Game, and poor sleeping habit was the cause of him being so stressed up all the time. Because that year, he yelled at me every single day, multiple times a day, for the dumbest things ever. Now, I remind you, I was getting bullied at School. And I came back Home, only to get yelled at for everything I did and didn't do. \n\nI was never Safe. Not a School, not at Home. I started singning into a lot of extracurriculars. Now, I liked the activities, but being away from Home? Hell yeah, sign me up.\n\nEvery single scold, started developing a small fire in me. Burning with hate towards him, that he kept on making grown bigger with every cruel joke, with every favouritism detail, with every insult while he was mad, and everytime he yelled or complained to or about me.\n\nNow I can't ignore it. I feel uncomfortbale every time he touches me. He put his arm around my shoulder the other day and I felt a disgusting feeling. I ignore him as much as I can and it makes him mad. He feels entitled to my love.\nOne time he hugged me, and told me he loved me, thing which he hadn't done in YEARS, and I mean YEARS, not just 2 but about 5 or 6 years. I said I love you back, simply to end it and not be mean. Yet I felt no love, I only felt uncomfortable.\n\nI am a very loving person towards those I care about, and it shows with my mom. I constantly hug her, tell her I love her, do my best treat her with respect, listen to her, answer her texts which I almost don't do with my father, share candy with her because I know she likes it, etc, etc. And he hates that he doesn't get the same treatment. But I just. . . don't feel any love towards him. \n\nAITA for this? ",

      "selftext": "First of all, Please forgive me for bad English. English isn't my first language.\n\nSo I (28F) and my husband (36M) got married last year.\n\nOriginally, I wasn't even wanting to do a wedding. However, wedding is really important in his culture so I agreed to have one small reception and religious ceremony for marriage just with our direct family members. (He is from South Asia and I'm from Eastern Asia)\n\nWe had a destination wedding so everyone took flight from their own countries. Here's the first drama. I worked as a flight attendant so I issued discounted tickets for everyone. This is basically standby tickets. If airline has empty seats, you can get a seat. Most of time you need to wait until the last moment to get to know if you'll get seat or not but the deal is 90% off so we just quietly wait. Other than waiting, there's some other conditions to use the tickets, one of which was to be polite with the airline stuffs. If the person who use my ticket misbehaved, I will be the one responsible and worst case, I can get fired. I already told everyone about the condition. Everyone seemed understanding but brother in law (45M, I'll call him James) was making comments like \"Why can I not get a confirmation?\" etc but I just blushed off as I was really busy that time.\n\nFast forward to the day we all left. I got a call from sister in law (33F, she is a wife of James and sister of my husband. I'll call her Susan) crying on the phone. They went to the airport but they're coming from the destination which is always busy so ground stuff told them to wait until most of customers finish checkin. Somewhat that made James upset and started to fight with ground stuff so now the stuff is threatening them to report this to the company. I immediately asked her to let me speak with the stuff and I explained them a situation and apologized. The stuff understood the situation so they didn't make it big of deal and gave them a seats in the end. This was the first drama.\n\nSecond drama happened the day before my reception day. Each one of families had their own plans to stay in the destination. Some of them just stay for few days but others stayed for over a week. James decided to stay for a week which wasn\u2019t bad if he would've just attended the wedding and a little sightseeing nearby. But he somewhat booked 3 days trip with Susan to another city of the country. The city he tried to visit is really far from the convention that they need to take a flight to go. He dropped this bomb and we all were mad. But he insisted to go and won't cancel it since it's non refundable. And what even worse is they have 2 children (2 years old and 4 years old) but he refused to take them since it's a child free trip. Susan claimed she didn't know about it and began crying. After hours of back and forth fight, my mother in law took decisions to babysit the children meanwhile they go on the trip just for the sake of finishing the drama. Apparently that makes hard for James to stay in the room with us, so he left. I was wondering what about Susan cancel the trip and take care of the children since it's her own children and was claiming she was unaware of the trip. But she insisted that if she won't come with him, he'll divorce her so she needs to come with him. I felt weird about it but everyone treated her as victim so I didn't push.\n\nNext day was our reception. Besides James drama, I had a huge problem with my makeup artist and driver so before even reaching to convention, I was already tired. But once I entered, I noticed something is wrong. I saw Susan was crying again. So the reason of her tears this time was her children were fussy and James weren't helpful so she can't enjoy the wedding. Everyone from in law side gave her an attention including my husband. At that point, I detached myself from the reality. I just focused on the food and ate like pig to distract myself from the mess. I wish I could cry but I didn't want my parents to worried about me, so I held tears. (My family wasn't there when James drama was happening and I didn't tell them to save my husband\u2019s faces)\n\nWe had religious wedding ceremony on the next day. It called nikkah which is Islamic marriage. We went to mosque to complete it. It required to have 2 witnesses for both bride and groom. And this mosque had a regulations that besides witnesses, only 2 guests can be there. So that makes excluding Susan. But James, mother in law, brother in law couple (husband's brother) and all of nephews and nieces were excluded as well. Yes, you guessed right. She started to cry again and even after we finish nikkah, she was crying.\n\nJames and Susan went on the lovely trip the next day and came back after 3 days. They supposed to land around 9 AM but no one got contact from them. We just thought maybe their flight delays or something. NO! We got a call few hours later from them saying they haven't seeing tourists area nearby convention yet so they've joined tour so they won't come back until night. Honestly, I was too tired to react this nonsense. Thinking nothing makes me surprised about them. Until we got an another call from Susan later on that day. Apparently police asked James to show ID and he stupidly refused. And shouting at police that he's American and he can do anything so he was about to sent police station. My nephew is native to the language of the country so he convinced police to let him go and somewhat they managed to not to get arrested.\n\nAt this point, I did not want to do anything with James and Susan. I told James that i don't want him to use discounted tickets under my name since he almost took my job away. But he started to cry and beg me to not to do it and as you can imagine Susan joined so I felt pressure from my in law family to not to do it. So I ended up letting him use it.\n\nMy husband's family bond are strong in both good way and bad way. After all these drama, they blindly believe Susan is the victim of the situation and James is the only villain here. I strongly disagree with it but I keep it in my heart since we all live in different countries so I don't expect to see them next anytime soon. That's what I thought. But nowadays, in laws are asking me to visit Susan and James since I'm still flight attendant and also has passport which doesn't required visa to enter US. I used my husband not having US visa as an excuse, but he got visa now so I don't have much excuse anymore. Honestly, if I need to see them again any time soon, I'd be end up in jail lol\n\nI told my husband that I wasn't mentally ready to see them but he seems like thinking I wasn't serious.\n\nI feel like I'm holding a grudge too long now.\n\nSo AITAH?\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "I've asked her multiple times to please not share information about me\n(excluding sick) to my family. She has broke this boundary many times. \nI sent her texts in a gc with my partner to feel more safe since she dismisses me and I was hoping with my partner in the chat she'd listen.\nI'm tired of going to chat gpt to help me make an\nemotionally mature text to send her for her to not improve and I blew up.\n\nSince I cant include screen shots, heres copy and paste of the texts:\n\nMe: Mom stop telling my fucking buisness to abuelo. He tells abuela everything and now all the family knows. STOP. They\u2019re all asking me about the wedding\nHer: What business \nMe: To you it may be just a wedding but to me I have NOTHING private NOTHING\nHer: ok\nMe: Please just please stop telling them where I go. I want privacy. I dont want to share that with them\nHer: ok\nMe: Jesus fuck I cant talk to anyone in the family. Bc all of yall constantly make me feel violated by telling everyone any and everything about me. I get if im sick but where im going, i just want ONE THING ANYTHING private to me, ANYWAY. like -name- told you(-name- assistant) that he has zero fucking privacy and its the reason the he if ores his family now or whatever. Bc in going to do that when I move out. If it doesnt stop bc it makes me feel crazy. Ive told yall multiple times. And I\u2019m never listened to so the family is getting completely cut off when I move out if they continue that crap bc I need to be treated like a human not a show dog. Think of me as overrating all you want but take a moment to try to see from my shoes. I know you meant no harm and were excited or just want something to talk about but why not ask me first at the least???? But then even if I say no youll prob srill tell him anyway bc this family has 40+ yrs history of not respecting others \u201cno\u201d\nHer: Sorry I just got excited cause I love weddings and receptions \nMe: Ik I\u2019m being over sensitive to things these last few days but ppl reach breaking points. Was me talking to you about it not enough. It makes me feel so uncomfortable bc then abuela and everyone gives their two whatever the wuote is. Or abuela will make me feel uncomfortable about it. It makes me feel deeply uncomfortable that they all get to know EVERYTHING about me EVERYTHING. Plus I dont even get a chance to tell ppl shit like you stole that opportunity from me if I DID want to share stuff.\nHer: Ok -my name-\nMe: I dont go around saying everything you do that day. I just lie to them and say work no matter what bc its not my place. Yall get mad at ME for calling yall out.\nHer: I don\u2019t care if you tell them about me \nMe: Well I care and I told u why\nHer: I know now \n\nHer now in private chat to me: I understand but your texts are coming off as\nabusively silencing me which trigger me because -ex husband name- did that to me\nMe: -face palm emoji-  -my partners name- said theres nothing abusive about it\nHer: I FEEL IT IS\nABUSIVE AND I HAVE THR RIGHT TO FEEL THAT WAY\nMY FEELINGS MATTER ALSO\nNOT JUST YOURS\nI understand what you are saying\nMe: I FEEL\nDEHUMANIZED\nBY YOU AND YOU NEVER LISTEN OR EVEN APOLOGIZE OR TAKE ACOUNTABILITY. ^ Thats me copying your energy\nher: I did apologize\n\ud83d\udea8Me: You dont truly understand why im hurt donyou? \nHer: I understand\nMe: Then explain to me why im upset\nHer: I understand and apologized.\nStop treating me like I'm 5 years old\nI feel like I'm constantly your whipping boy\nYou treat me like shit\nI'm always walking on eggshells around you\nMe: What in the projecting\nHer: -my name- im done\nMe: If you really\nunderstand then explain to me why\nIM upset\nYou cant\nAnd thats bc you dont care and dont listen. You not being able to explain why in upset proves that\nBc then youd realize \"my daughter is really hurt and trying to ask for help\"\nHer: You wanted that moment to tell them where you went if you in fact wanted to share that information w them\nI am also very hurt -my name- and have been\nBut I don't matter to anyone\nMe: This isnt about you right now\nAnd no thats bot why im upset\nHer: It you need help then ask me and l'll help anyway I can but I feel like you push me away\nMe: Be you try to force things on me\nHer: You don't want them in your business\nMe: And when I ask for help you play victim. Its exhausting And drainingn\nHer: -my name- its always about you\nMe: No shit\nBc if I have a problem, the problem is about me\nJesus you're narcissistic and I wish youd just listen\n-1 Reply-\nJust listen\n\ud83d\udea8Her: Give me an example   [of when she plays victim]\nI feel that way about you.   [to me calling her narcissist]\nYou blame me for everything horrible under the Sun\nI feel like my\ndaughter hates me and it seriously the worst feeling in the world to feel that\nIn your eyes I never do anything right and never have\nMe: You told me I made u feel humiliated and such about when I told you if you can change the subject when you were talking about\n-step brother- family \nwhen I accidentally brought him up.\nWhen I was feeling scared with really bad chest pain, you ASKED ME why l felt scared, and you cut me off when l was not even a full sentence in to tell me how god forbid everything isnt about me and what a victim you are.\nWhen ever ive tried to tell you when I hurt and you immediately\ndismiss me call me selfish and all the like then play victim and call me abusive for getting upset.\nHer: Try talking to me like you talk to someone you like and are friends with because you talk to me like I'm a villain\nMe: I get mad at you bc you rarely listen then play victim when youre the one who pulls emotionally\nabusive things on me\nIts the weirdest fucking thing ever\nI talk to u \"like youre a villain\" bc you dont listen and dont understand\nHer: I feel you shut me up and love to do it with an audience like -my partners name-\nMe: Ive told you this since middle school\nHer: Well maybe we should go to counseling\ntogether to resolve our issues\nBecause I want us to have a good relationship but we aren't seeing eye to eye\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve watched videos about covert narcissists and cried bc it sounds just like her. I know when she brought up her therapy, this it isn\u2019t serious because last time she called the therapist a narcissist and immediately pulled me out of therapy.\n\nEdit 2: maybe we\u2019re both the ah since I will share with her about my day or plans even though she has consistently disrespected my boundaries. I mean that is my fault.. I can\u2019t do the same thing and expect different results. At the same time she is also the ah for rarely respecting boundaries and not being emotionally intelligent or available.",

      "selftext": "My husband (32M) is upset that I didn\u2019t pick him up from the airport tonight. He\u2019s been away on a work trip for 8 days, and while I\u2019m happy he\u2019s coming home, these 8 days have been... challenging.\n\nWe have two kids (10 and 5), who I absolutely adore, but let\u2019s be honest they\u2019re energy bombs. On top of that, I work full-time in a stressful job that often requires overtime. During this week, their school was closed for two days, so I had to juggle being a full-time mom and employee simultaneously (I work from home).\n\nTo make things harder, we recently moved to a new town. We don\u2019t have family nearby, no trusted babysitter yet, and only a few new friends. So, yeah, these 8 days have been exhausting, but I managed.\n\nMy husband\u2019s original flight was supposed to land at 8 PM, and the airport is about 2 hours away one way. That\u2019s already a 4-hour round trip with the kids, which I wasn\u2019t thrilled about, but I was willing to do it. However, his flight got delayed, and instead of landing at 8 PM, it wasn\u2019t due to arrive until 11\u201311:30 PM.\n\nAt that point, I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable driving that late with the kids (poorly lit highways and all). I suggested he either:\n\n1. Stay overnight at a hotel near the airport, and I could pick him up tomorrow after work (6\u20137 PM).\n2. Take a train the next day at 4 PM, which would get him into town by 5 PM, and I could pick him up (a short 10-minute drive).\n\nHe didn\u2019t take it well. I could tell he was annoyed short replies, ignoring my texts, and just the overall vibe of someone upset but not saying it directly. Now, I\u2019m feeling a little guilty. Maybe I should\u2019ve just gone to get him? But I also feel bad for the kids and honestly a bit for myself too.\n\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA for sticking to my decision? Or should I have just sucked it up and driven out to get him?\n\n**TL;DR:** Husband (32M) upset I didn\u2019t pick him up from the airport after his flight got delayed to 11:30 PM. I\u2019ve been solo parenting two kids (10 and 5) for 8 days while working a stressful full-time job. Suggested he stay in a hotel or take a train the next day because the 4-hour late-night drive wasn\u2019t ideal. He\u2019s annoyed, and now I feel guilty. AITA?",

      "selftext": "My 9 year old son suffers from severe epilepsy, and flashing lights often trigger him into seizure. It\u2019s usually really hard around christmas time because everybody\u2019s house has flashing lights, but our street is small and a tightly knit community so everyone has come together to make suitable adjustments i.e lights that stay solid/fading rather than flashing/dim settings etc. My family has been super grateful and it has made things so much easier for us during December. Recently we had a new neighbour move in right on the corner of the street, meaning her house front is in direct view of the rest of the street. She recently put up an abnormally large amount of lights and light up decorations that, while pretty, flash a lot and stay on during the day. My son has to walk down the street to his school, and usually we let him go alone or with a buddy, but the other day one of the neighbours caught him as he had a seizure because of the neighbours lights. I won\u2019t go into detail, but the neighbour did come out to help. My son is thankfully well now, and I went to speak to my neighbour the next day to talk about the incident and ask if there was any way she could turn down the intensity of the flashing and/or turn off the lights during the day. This way my son would not be exposed to the flashing because he is usually at home after dark, and the lights can still be on and beautiful at night. Plus, it\u2019s kind of pointless to have lights on during the day. My neighbour seemed a little down at having been told to turn it off, but mostly seemed okay with it. The first day she kept it off, but by the second day the lights were on again. I thought maybe she had just forgot, so I went to ask her a second time and maybe remind her before my son left, but she said that after keeping them off for one day her house just didn\u2019t look right so she turned them on again. Then she suggested that maybe I just drive my son the other way down the street to school (which would add ten minutes onto his journey, and also impossible because my husband and I both work). My whole street has found out and they are split so I\u2019m wondering AITA?\n\nEdit/update: People seem to have gotten confused by the 10 minutes bit. It would add ten minutes for driving, maybe an extra half an hour if my son was to walk. His school starts at 9:30 and the gates only open at 9. My husband leaves for work at 8, and I work from home with a major online meeting every morning at 9 which is why I say it\u2019s impossible.\n\nA lot of people suggested councils; not much in our area that would care too much. Also light timers were a good idea except when I say she has a lot of lights up I mean probably eight or nine different outlets.\n\nA few hours ago the mother of one of my son\u2019s friends came to visit and offered to drive my son to school for the next few weeks which I greatly appreciated and agreed to. We live in a semi regional area of Australia so there\u2019s only two or so weeks of school left until February (I assume the lights will be gone by then haha). Thanks for all the support!\n",

After we had our first kid I decided to leave the military on her constant arguing and fighting of me being in. Shortly after she got pregnant with our second and my family became more toxic against her. I ended up cutting them off.  Few years later we buy a house and have our 3rd child. In 2019 weeks sell our house and move. Then Covid hits we fall on hard times we rack up a debt. Now it\u2019s constant berating I don\u2019t do enough I\u2019m not a real man why can\u2019t I be more like this person or more like that person. She doesn\u2019t work at all she does do a lot of the house work but not all. We both take turns cooking. I bring in all the money that keeps everything going but we are barely  making enough to pay down our debt. Now recently I find out she has an old fling she talks to from before we were together. She swears it\u2019s only as a friend. There is no likely hood of them ever doing anything because he lives on the other side of the United States. But when ever I ask her to stop talking to him she gets defensive. If he was a child hood friend i would have no problem with it but this is an ex sexual partner and when ever we get in a fight she is sure to remind me of that. I have no female friends at all she would loose it if I did. And lately it seems we are constantly fighting and when we do she gets really toxic with it lately talking about my childhood being raised by an addict and I\u2019m useless. I\u2019m reaching my breaking point. She refuses for us to see counseling. I see individual counseling for my military time and think therapy is good. I love my children and no matter what happens I\u2019ll be the best dad possible and I feel that\u2019s the only reason I haven\u2019t gone through the divorce along with if I did I would literally be on the streets. I would never ask her to leave the home with the kids but I literally have no one I can stay with or turn to for help. Once again I\u2019m at my breaking point and don\u2019t know what to do. Divorce seems more and more like a reality .\n\nThanks in advance for advice or thoughts.",

      "selftext": "1.5 years ago my significant other (M32) and myself (F32) went through a rough patch and I decided we should separate. We share a child  (M7) and a house. He wanted to keep the house which was fine because I wanted my son to still have his home. I needed to start over on my own so I needed him to buy me out. He initially wanted to take over payments and keep me on the mortgage. That wasn\u2019t going to work because I needed to get a place of my own and didn\u2019t want my credit tied up into that property. We sat down with his mom to discuss options on how to proceed with the split. For a little background, he is a mommas boy and she is aware of his business from his perceptive. His parents are wealthy and at one point it was shared to me that they were interested in buying our house from us and putting it in their trust for us to live in it eventually. This idea never sat well with me, because I don\u2019t like to feel like I owe someone something and I didn\u2019t want to worry about being asked to leave for whatever reason and no say. Let\u2019s just say that this conversation about us splitting didn\u2019t go well when it was brought up if it would be a possibility for them to be interested in doing that for their son and grandson and buy the home them since my sons father doesn\u2019t have the credit to buy me out himself. In no way was I telling her what to do, we were simply discussing options. His mother got offended, said a few words that were not so nice and asked for me to return an engagement ring her son had given me. Conversation ended. The tension escalated between myself and him/his mother as expected with divided property and assets. I lawyered up because I wanted someone in my corner against him/his parents/his parents lawyer. She has called me a disgusting human being amongst other things, criticized my parenting and tried to tell me what I can post on my social media. I blocked her. In the end, she bought the house exactly how I guessed it would happen and I got bought out of my half. My significant other and myself have since reconciled, had a baby, and got married. He tried to get me to move back into the house his parents purchased but like hell that would happen. We have since moved into a new home and his parents remodeled and moved his sister into our old home. There is still bad blood between myself and his mother but agree to disagree for the sake of the grandkids. However, I chose to still have a boundary and keep her blocked on social media. My now husband has asked me to unblock her so that she can see pictures of the kids that he is tagged in, saying that it will cause problems between us if I don\u2019t. He personally doesn\u2019t share family pictures on social media because he says that those who are close to us are present and he doesn\u2019t need to. I am thinking that it is because I am the one sharing enough so he doesn\u2019t have to. I\u2019m set on keeping her blocked for personal reasons and told him to post the pictures himself or send them directly to her. I feel like he doesn\u2019t respect my boundaries and crossing the line for the sake of making his life easier dealing with his mother. AITAH",

I wanted to add screenshots of some texts but this community doesn\u2019t allow that, but if you could please not accuse me of lying for no reason I\u2019d really appreciate it! \n\nMy best friend since fourth grade (\u201cAllison\u201d) called me last Monday in a panic telling me that she was going to be evicted from her apartment if she couldn\u2019t come up with the $200 she was short on rent for the month, as she was already a month behind so she asked to borrow it until she gets paid this past Friday. She said her landlords wouldn\u2019t wait til Fri, begged me for the money. \n\nI do not have money to lend. I\u2019m a single mom and I work as a bartender so I don\u2019t even live paycheck to paycheck, it\u2019s day to day for me & my 2 kids (8m & 6f). I know that Allison\u2019s rent problems are real, though, and I\u2019ve lost both of my parents, only child, so I\u2019m not exaggerating in saying that she\u2019s my only family. \n\nI had her come over and explained to her that I could let her borrow this money, but it\u2019s what I had saved up for my son\u2019s birthday party coming up this weekend and I NEED it back by this week to get his gift and everything ready for his party. Invitations are already out to kids at school, etc. \n\nSince his birthday is so close to Christmas, I always make sure to have some type of celebration because I remember kids growing up & stories from people I\u2019ve met whose birthdays were also close to Christmas saying how much they always hated it cause their birthday would get overshadowed. \n\nSo I explained all of this to her and she says she understands and how I should know she\u2019d never do anything to jeopardize the party, she\u2019s literally both of my kids\u2019 Godmother, etc. I know that you shouldn\u2019t lend out money that you can\u2019t afford to lose but I\u2019ve already explained how close we are, and I moronically went against this and gave her the money anyway. \n\nI\u2019m sure you can guess the rest. Friday has come and gone and she said that she had some bill autopay from her account that she\u2019d forgotten about and she just doesn\u2019t have the money to pay me back now. \n\nI\u2019m beyond devastated, like I haven\u2019t even told my son yet and I\u2019m starting to cry even thinking about how that\u2019s gonna go. But what has me pissed off now is how she\u2019s acting towards me, like annoyed that I\u2019m upset and I feel like she\u2019s minimizing how upsetting this is gonna be for my son. I understand that to her it\u2019s her rent vs a kid\u2019s birthday party, but my son isn\u2019t gonna see it that way and he shouldn\u2019t have to. I planned very carefully to be able to pull this party together for him and I explained all of that to her face to face and she swore that this exact thing would not happen. And *she\u2019s* annoyed somehow? I honestly feel like going no contact over this like that\u2019s how upset I am. But again, she\u2019s literally one of the only people I have in my life, so I don\u2019t wanna say something I\u2019ll regret. But AITAH here??",

      "selftext": "How do i even start. Yesterday was the one of if not the worst day i have ever expirienced. For context me and my girl have a history of going back and forth together or separate. She had multiple partners not serious thou and one semi serious. We are thogether for over 5 years. Yesterday she hung out with her college classmates and then we had a plan that i will pick her up and we will go for a ride with the car. We also got condoms. Well we initially intended to have sex and we were searching for a spot. Until we had sex everything was perfect. We had a great time and a lot of fun. However when we started having intercourse i initially got it up but when we started i couldnt hod it for long. Them she told me \"u cant hold your erection\". And as you might imagine this was the end of what we were doing. Then we gpt to the ride home. This was the worst part. We were silent a bit then she started to ask what was wrong with me because i was obviously hit by a truck. It never happened to me before. I told her that what happened deeply disturbed me. And at some point during the ride i got stopped by a cop for a routine chekup(i didnt even get tested for alcohol) and after the check she just started going on how i would have done something for them to stop me. Them we got in an argument about it and she hit me with \"why werent you able to keep it hard\". And i told her it was probbably bevause i jerk off too much(like 2 3 times a day)(i also jerked the same day 1 time). Then she was silent and stared comparing me to a college classmate of hers with the words(maybe he isnt the loser maybe you are). And this was it. I yelled at her once to shut up. And she did. I immedietly appologised and she was not talking to me. So i stopped the car and apologised to her extensively. Eventually she started talking again. I never raise my voicd to her. Never in out 5 year history i have never done anything violent like that. I was just really emotional at the moment. Them we got to her apartment i was driving her to. She forgot something in the car so i shouted but she didnt hear. Then i got out of the car but instead of stepping on the floor of the car i stepped on the pedal and the car went into a bench inront of the apartment building. Then she got back when she heard this. She stayed for a while while i tried getting out the board from the bench that was stuck in my car. She proposed calling her dad but i refused. She even started calling him but i begged her not to. Then she told me that she is cold and she is getting home. Then i told her \"I will get it done myself alone like everything else\". And thats it.\nFor clarification the day before this she went on about how she wanted to be free and how her mother told her to have fun while she is young and stuff like that. I just want het to be my wife. I love her a lot. She broke me up during the summer and always tells me that we broke up back then but when we go out she still tells me that we are \"married\" (we arent officially). She also told me about a college of hers that told her he losves her or smt like that. Ant to this moment i still feel a hole in me. Like a bug lump in my throat. I event started to stutter again(i did when i was 10 years old).\nSo do you think its worth pursuing a serious relationship with this woman?\nI thougth of it a lot and i really love her.\nAnd can i even forget this memory when we had intimacy? What do i do now with my trauma? Would i ever be able to perform during such activities? Can u suggest me any was that i solve this?",

      "selftext": "So I work at Target and it may not be the most stressful job out there it is hard to get through the day without an energy drink. During my break I was drinking my energy drink and realized I only had a minute left and proceeded to dump out the energy drink into the sink and drinking a little bit of the remaining drink before going back to my shift. Then when I finished my shift at work, after talking to customers for five and a half hours with a small break in-between, I am looking forward to eating my leftover Chinese food from the day and excited about the DNA kit I was prepping the night before that my best friend got me for my Christmas gift since it was on sale on Amazon. After arriving home I see my Christmas gift (a 23 and Me DNA kit) open on the table ripped to pieces, making it so I cannot mail it without buying a whole other DNA kit. I could tell it was my dad who did it because he is very impatient and has a bit of a \"this is my home so any mail that I get regardless of name should be checked by me\" attitude. Additionally, they could have also texted me or called me and ask about the package and ask if they should open it because I always leave my phone notifications on and check my phone on my small break, especially since my dad is unemployed and is constantly on his phone while my mom is the only one who works besides me and my part time Target job. Back to when I saw the DNA kit ripped open, my mom said she was confused what the box was and told me she opened at it and I went off on her. Keep in my mind I told my dad to drop this said DNA kit package at USPS on Monday when he got the chance if he didn't mind but I didn't tell him what was in it because that is my business and I didn't think he would open it without my permission. My mom was therefore angry for me screaming at her (rightfully so) and asked my dad if he knew about the DNA kit package that I wanted him to drop off at USPS and he said he didn\u2019t remember. Convenient of course... then when he said he did not remember I screamed at him for opening the box because 1. it was not his business 2. he claimed it did not have my name on it but that is because it is a DNA kit that is registered under my name so when they scan the barcode on the package they can tell it is my spit in the tube 3. he screamed at me when I was looking for some batteries in his room not too long ago saying that it is his private area and to not go through his things\n\nSo basically, am I the a-hole for screaming at them after a shift with little caffeine and my privacy being invaded for no reason other than he had the \"right\" to since it was his house (even though technically its under my mom's name)?\n\nP.S. I threw out the energy drink because at Target you cannot drink anything besides water in front of the customers so I couldn\u2019t keep it with me while I worked and I had two hours left in my shift so it would gone flat by then\nAlso I threw that detail in there to possibly explain why I potentially may have went off on them because I wasn\u2019t as caffeinated and energetic as I usually was. Not sure if that makes any sense but that\u2019s why I talked about the energy drink (did not think it was that important)",

Every person I have ran into or surrounded myself with began to have this cup in their right hands. Decorated with a backpack or even now a new collab with a makeup and face brand. I always mentioned how much I couldn\u2019t stand this particular brand cups to any person I seen and always said I like a competitor brand that had a mixed color bottle. Anyways, they finally meet up with me to do a gift unwrapping. Lo and behold my arch nemesis cup and another pricey gift in a color (I do not like and have never worn a day in my life) were received for my birthday gifts. At first I was very happy when I received my gifts since as stated before no one usually cares.

      "selftext": "I\u2019ve read a few posts about girls receiving body washes and soaps and loving them, but I don\u2019t feel like that. I received my first body wash set at 16 and basically gave it back because I said I wasn\u2019t going to use it, my cousin ended up using it. I\u2019ve never like the scents they use, and besides that I already suffered with body acne and sensitive skin. Fast forward to last year, my 21st, I had sent out a list of things I liked and shared it with my family, they were all reasonably priced. I only did this because I\u2019ve had a history of people gifting me things and actually giving them away because it\u2019s not anywhere close to what I like or use. But when I opened them, I had at least 7-10 body wash sets. I was beyond disappointed, because it was why I sent the list. But my mum said I should be grateful, and I was, it\u2019s the thought that counts right. But I was also sad, they spend their money on me and I just give it away. It also makes me feel like no one knows anything about me. Like there are so many things I talk about that interest me. And a year later I receive another body wash set, and all the feelings flood in. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m grateful for the thought, but now I just feel like they\u2019ve wasted their hard earned money. I\u2019m okay with even just a birthday card. That\u2019s how simple I am. My hygiene routine is also quite set and I don\u2019t chop and change things. Am I the asshole for being disappointed and complaining about getting bath sets as a gift?\n\n\nThank you everyone for the advice <3",

      "selftext": "Hello f 21! I recently turned 21 and for my 21st birthday I decided to get an air bnb with a few friends! I paid for the air bnb itself and my friends just had to pay for food and drinks. That being said my best friend really ruined it for me and honestly made me extremely uncomfortable. \n\nThe first night there I had told everyone that I didn\u2019t what to share a room and wanted to be alone! ( all the girls had their own beds) once we get situated we go out to grab breakfast for tomorrow and food for that night so we can cook and eat at home- once we get back we all start drinking, cooking, smoking, and overall having fun! Throughout that night I had wayyyy way way to much to drink and got sooo messed up that I apparently had stripped out of my clothes. My homegirl Pam was putting pajamas on me and helped me get into bed ( this is what I was told my two other friends) when I woke up the next morning my closest friend Rebecca was in the bed with me and I was fully nude. I was a bit uncomfortable especially because I was naked but also because I had told everyone I didn\u2019t what to share a bed with anyone! So I wake up grab my clothes and go get some water. Everyone slowly starts to awake and so yada yada yada..\n I go to check my phone and I saw that Rebecca had posted a video of me on her close friends - I was obviously naked and Pam was putting clothes on me. She had to censor half the video out that\u2019s how I knew I was naked. Soo I automatically exit out of the app and walk out the room ( I didn\u2019t confront her right away because she doesn\u2019t take well to being confronted as well as just wanting to keep the peace. There was already a bit of attitude coming from her before we even got to the air bnb) on top of that as soon as we get to the air bnb she is crying and isolating herself ( I had to step away and ask her why and she just refused to answer me; which also dampened my mood because i mean who wants to have fun when their friend is crying yk?) \nSo I just left the video alone and continued on with my day. That same day we were supposed to go to downtown Disney, out to eat, and get piercings, then come back home and eat and drink again. I wanted to be at downtown Disney at 11:30 am- ( we all knew what time to be ready by and what the plan was as this is something that was spoken about numerous times in the group chat) Rebecca caught an attitude with me because I said everyone has 90 minutes to get ready. She was mad and said I was rushing her. She ended up taking about 4 hours to get ready\u2026 while everyone was ready in under 90 minutes. We didn\u2019t get to downtown Disney until 2:30. Once we get to downtown Disney we walk around do a bit of shopping and Rebecca and my other friend yemi start bickering. I had to change my shoes because my feet were hurting. So Rebecca and yemi are bickering over which ones are better the white or black ones. I end up getting the black ones and Rebecca gave 2 snarky remarks. It was very tense after that. So we all decide to grab some margaritas but Rebecca was hungry so we tried to look for something to SNACK on! We had food at the air bnb ( a lot of it- dip, chips, cake, cookies, eggs, gravy, etc) so we found a little ice cream and as we are there Rebecca decides to leave and look for food ( I was already pissed off because she took forever to get ready, then she was passive aggressive to one of my friends, as well as was giving snarky remarks towards me and talking about yemi to me) so once she leaves I decide to continue walking around and doing my own thing. As we are walking I step away to catch a breath and calm down. Once I was away another one of the girls name Marsha decided to go look for Rebecca- so Rebecca and Marsha come back and she ( Rebecca) is like oh I found a place to eat! ( mind you everyone agreed that we weren\u2019t hungry\u2026 we also would be cooking and eating very heavy that night) so we walk to the restaurant that rebacca wanted to go to only for me to realize her and Marsha are eating by themselves.  I was in the back so once I caught up they were already walking into the restaurant just by themselves. We walked for a little over an hour before I texted Rebecca asking where she was at- she had told me that her and Marsha were waiting and just now got their food. So I texted her asking her to package their food up because we have to start leaving. She ignored me. So I ended up texting Marsha and she\u2019s like \u201c we are already done\u201d so Rebecca had lied to me ( I also knew she lied because she had posted pictures that Marsha had took over her on her instagram) Also to add on I wanted to take pictures because I loved my outfit and had asked Rebecca to take pictures of me. She usually does very well but that day she was doing TERRIBLE! She was literally not listening and just felt like she was trying to sabotage my pics\u2026 and so afterwards I ended up taking her pics but I tried to do a different angle because the way she had mine the sunlight was ruining it. So she ( Rebecca) gets mad and goes \u201c take them right like I did yours\u201d very aggressively\u2026 so anyway that day I had made the decision that I was going to cut her off. The last month and a half I had already gotten bad vibes and have been feeling like this friendship was very one sided. That being said I am an early bird! I am usually asleep by 10. Everytime I was falling asleep she was screaming and shaking my head to keep me up. And she was doing this to just me nobody else. So needless to say Sunday comes me and a few of the girls age sitting outside talking- yemi tells me how Rebecca was trying to get into my room last night around 2-3 am ( I had locked my door because of the previous night) which yemi wasn\u2019t lying because around 2 am I woke up to someone trying to get into my room. I just didn\u2019t know it was her. So I also asked them why they didn\u2019t put pajamas on me and that\u2019s when they had told me they did put pajamas on\u2026 we all collectively agreed that it\u2019s weird I went to sleep with clothes then woke up naked next to Rebecca. So we ate chit chatting and then decide to start cleaning up to leave. Rebecca and Marsha didn\u2019t help clean anything at all the entire trip- they also spent most of their time on their phones and not trying to be part of the group. So when it\u2019s time to leave I have to take Marsha and Rebecca home. It\u2019s very quiet on the ride and obviously tense. I am a person where my feelings show on my face. So a few minutes before I drop Marsha off Rebecca asked me if I was mad at her- I simply told her we\u2019d talk later. As soon as I dropped Marsha off Rebecca went in to use the bathroom. About 35 minted later we were at Rebecca\u2019s house. I couldn\u2019t even look Rebecca in the eye as I had felt uncomfortable and disappointed in our friendship. Me and Rebecca had been inseparable since March. We\u2019ve done everything together so seeing how she acted towards me this previous weekend was very disheartening. As soon as I got home I texted Rebecca saying I wanted to stay in low contact. After that I went to Instagram to remove her off my accounts only to realize she had blocked me. After that I made the decision to send her a message expressing how I felt uncomfortable, how I don\u2019t think this is a friendship I want, and how her behavior was unacceptable. As soon as I sent that message I blocked her.  Now almost 12 hours later she has sent me 5 messages off two fake accounts on TikTok. She hasn\u2019t taken accountability but instead has tried to gaslight me, manipulate me, and make it seem she is the victim. I just need to know am I in the wrong for this? Everyone I\u2019ve talked to has said no and what she did was not okay. But they are my friends so I need an outside POV- I also have not responded to anything she has said but instead have just continued blocking accounts. I\u2019ve said what I needed to say and the fact she would rather have the last word ( which this is what she said to start off with \u201c you got to say your piece so I am saying mine\u201d than to see that her actions have made me feel uncomfortable is just really crazy to me. I\u2019ve explained how she didn\u2019t take them with my consent and she still doesn\u2019t see an issue. So am I just being over dramatic? Should I respond to her text? I just don\u2019t know what to do and if blocking her was right. I know a boundary of mine was crossed but am I being irrational? ",

They argued that I was being entitled and ungrateful because our parents have sacrificed a lot for us. While I do appreciate that, I lost my temper and exploded, saying I\u2019m allowed to feel how I feel or not care about it.\n\nGrowing up, I was subjected to both physical and verbal abuse, and as the oldest, I got the worst of it. When I was around 13 or 14, I failed my exams terribly. I also have dyslexia, which was diagnosed but never properly addressed. The next day, I had to stay in the school hostel because my parents\u2019 punishment was so severe, and I had marks on my body. I still carry the emotional scars from that experience, and even though it\u2019s been 8+ years, I still hold a grudge.\n\nWhen I recently tried to talk to my dad about how that treatment made me feel, he brushed it off, saying it \u201cwasn\u2019t even that bad\u201d and that I was \u201cdancing around like a monkey\u201d at the time. That response made me feel like my pain wasn\u2019t taken seriously and that I was being mocked.\n\nEven till this day my mom has continued to be verbally abusive, and I\u2019ve essentially given up on having a normal relationship with her. But my brothers and the rest of the family continue to suck up to her. I feel like everyone has their breaking point, and I\u2019ve reached mine.\n",

I just accepted her apology like any other person would forgive when someone told them sorry, but the matter is she behaves like nothing had happened and just seems to be like a friend though she posts snippets of her other friends and says \"Best Friends\". But when we hangout she doesn't seem to be enthusiastic enough and keeps ranting about her new friends and keeps talking to them on the phone. And during my birthday,she deletes all her socials and gives some reason for it which makes me feel like she doesn't want others to know that we're still friends. I just sometimes feel that maybe I forgave her because I don't have any other friends but it just makes me feel so uncomfortable to be her friend. Added to all these, she texts my crush with a heart emoji and says that she doesn't like him at all. \nAm I literally being an asshole here???",

She started dating one of my son\u2019s best friends 17M two months ago.\n\nThey seem happy and they get along great, but the problem is that my son feels like he has to do everything with his cousin now. My son and my niece have always been more like brother and sister than cousins, so they\u2019re close but they get on each other\u2019s nerves. My son and his friends like to do things and just bring their girlfriends or whatever, but now that means my niece has entered my son\u2019s friend circle. \n\nHe complained about it a little, but it was silly complaints. It was mostly that his friend never wants to hang out anymore, and I told him it happens when people date, I even reminded him of how he was with his last girlfriend when they started dating. He accepted it after that but I\u2019ve gotten a little more concerned. I\u2019ve just seen him not hang out with his friends as much, even when they invite him, staying home more, and just generally seeming sort of down. He's changed since he's stopped hanging out with friends.\n\nI knew this was because of my niece and her dating situation, so I asked her if she\u2019d be open to stop dating his friend to get his mental health back on track. I didn\u2019t tell her, I didn\u2019t demand, I didn\u2019t say she needed to, I simply asked her if she would stop. She cried, she was frustrated and upset and I understand, I told her she doesn\u2019t have to, maybe just encourage her boyfriend to spend less time with her and more time with my son or something like that but either way it wasn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\nThat night her dad, my brother, was really upset that I\u2019d even ask that. My husband was too, he said they\u2019ll all get over it eventually, it\u2019s teenager stuff. I agree, but I still worry. My brother told other family members and now most of my family are saying it was wrong of me to stick my nose in their business.\n\nI\u2019m just getting a lot of crap from different directions because I\u2019m being told it was wrong to try to intervene in something that will likely blow over anyway. I don\u2019t know if it will blow over, but I\u2019m familiar with how teenage relationships go. I honestly just want my son to be okay. I didn\u2019t want to hurt my niece, I just wanted to see if that was even a viable solution to the problem at hand. Now that I know my niece is serious about this, I\u2019m not pushing, but I\u2019m still being told I\u2019m an AH.",

He said he was a dick for saying that. \n\nSo I asked him what he knew about the break up. My ex told him I was being stroppy and I wasn\u2019t interested in sex anymore. So I told him the actual reasons we broke up, the fact I was SA and he didn\u2019t like another man put his hands on me and he was sexting other girls which is true, but considering what happened is it really surprising I\u2019d lost interest in sex. His face completely changed. He looked horrified. Told me how sorry he was I went through all that. He gave me a hug. Just before we parted ways he said he was going to reconsider his friendship with the ex. If he couldn\u2019t stand by the side and support the woman he supposedly loved after the SA and then wonder why I\u2019d lost interest in sex then he\u2019s probably not the best to be friends with. I thanked him for being understanding and wished him a lovely Christmas if I didn\u2019t see him before. He apologised again for being a dick. \n\nSo at least the friend apologised and the ex is a even bigger dick than I thought before talking to him. \n\nOriginal post. \n\nFor context I 42f and my ex 42m were close after we split up. We split up about 6 years ago. We split up due to a lot of things. I got really depressed after I was SA and that mixed with him sexting other women put a strain on our relationship. After 5 years together he broke up with me via text. He told me couldn\u2019t deal with my depression and the fact another man put his hands on me. \n\nHis new gf who\u2019s 8 years younger, she hated the fact we were still friends, she was very jealous. So me and the ex drifted apart. I respect that he wanted to put the new relationship with her first before our relationship and I was happy for him. \n\nAnyway. Both of my parents died in the space of a year of each other. He definitely knew as our mutual friend told him he confirmed that he\u2019d seen on Facebook about the funeral arrangements. I didn\u2019t get a text or call of condolences from him which again is fine. I didn\u2019t expect a call or text from him as we\u2019ve drifted apart. \n\nI recently saw on Facebook he\u2019s had a baby with his gf. I\u2019m happy for him. But as we haven\u2019t spoken or text or wanted to rock the boat with his gf I didn\u2019t text him or say anything on his Facebook announcement. I saw a mutual friend who told me that I was being babyish and jealous by not texting him or saying anything on Facebook. So told our mutual friend while I\u2019m very happy for him that things worked out for him and he has a baby, as he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to text after both my parents died, why should I feel obligated to congratulate him on his new baby and that I didn\u2019t want to cause any issues as being new parents is a very difficult time. \n\nSo am I being babyish? \n\nEdit: \nThank you all for your feedback. I\u2019m glad that you all helped me realise I\u2019m not being \u201cbabyish\u201d. After my parents dying I\u2019m second guessing everything and all my decisions. Looking back  over the years he gaslighted me a lot, made me believe his BS, made me insecure. All reasons why I stopped texting him and we drifted apart. \n\nI don\u2019t know if the friend actually knows what the ex is really like and the reasons why we split up. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he lied about it. If he lied to me about so many things, who knows what he tells others about the relationship. The friend was his bestie while we were together. He even tried to get us to get back together as he thought we made a good couple. \n\nWhile I\u2019m happy for him I\u2019m also glad he\u2019s out of my life. After the split my Dad told me he never really liked him anyway. Dad always did know best \ud83e\udd72. \n\nEDIT 2 To clarify I missed the part where the ex thinks I\u2019m a AH for not getting in touch with him apparently to him I didn\u2019t coz I\u2019m jealous. Like others here have pointed out it was always about him. The \u201cfriend\u201dthinks I\u2019m babyish. I couldn\u2019t give a flying F what the ex think. Was just more concerned about how others saw me like the \u201cfriend\u201d ",

      "selftext": "I work at a small food and beverage venue. After the owner, I am second in command. One manager, and then me. The manager (Greg) has started sleeping with and dating a lower level employee (Alisha). \n\nAlisha is a day dreamer, gets tired on the job easily, and even after working there for a few months, needs guidance on alot of tasks and often makes mistakes if not supervised. \n\nEven the owner has mentioned to me that they feel Alisha has the skill level of a junior worker.\n\nAnyway, the owner has been away lately, and the manager has been in charge. \n\nI am often pushing Alisha to get tasks done because if they are not done in time, she has to stay later than the allotted time, or someone else will complete them. \n\nOne day in particular, I didn't have alot of patience left for her as from the beginning of the shift she didn't know what tasks to complete or what to do. She has done that same shift  multiple times so I expected by now she would have at least some idea.\n\nIt really bothers me because she has a simple job, however, still makes mistakes (though she has been explained and done everything multiple times), takes up a lot of space (like standing in the way and taking a long time to move out), and takes a long time to do all the tasks. \n\nKeep In mind I am happy for both Greg and Alisha to be dating. I am friends with each of them outside of work. However, I am annoyed because I feel like Greg isn't pushing Alisha to work very hard at all and dismisses the stupid things that she does solely because they're an item. \n\nAnyway the other day she told me she didn't like the way I speak to her at work, and that it felt very condisending. \n\nTo be honest she is right I was condisending, and I do feel bad that I have upset her. \n\nI responded to her and apologised sincerely, but I dread working with her as I find she creates more work than help.\n\nI really feel she lacks a good work ethic, it doesn't seem like she pushes herself and I don't want her to think she can continue doing all of her tasks slowly and flirting in the middle of work just because she is in a relationship to the manager. \n\nIt's quite frustrating. \n\n I try to keep it to myself as they are friends of mine, but I find it very annoying when they flirt and get close at work. \n1. Everything at work should be kept professional \n2. Because she doesn't seem to push herself at all, but then has time for flirting??\n3. Because it's cringe worthy. She is clearly emotionally attached, he is a caring type, however I suspect he is in it for the sex and temporary companionship more than anything. (I am speculating of course but it makes me feel bad for her, and makes me think she is naive) \n\nI wish I didn't speak so condisendingly to her because I realised now she is a  really sensitive person. \n\nBut I can't get rid of this feeling of, if you can't do your job properly, and you can't handle the real world, where people will sometimes speak to you condisendingly, then thats your problem, you can't expect everyone to tiptoe around you, thats not how the world works.\n(I'm not saying the way I spoke was warranted here but it is a common occurrence, in life, and the industry) \n\nI could tell I had upset her because I asked her to do a few things and she would just pretend to not hear me. This sort of attitude just adds to my annoyance. I get it that her anxious personality may be holding her back and maybe I am being harsh but that's something she needs to work through. \n\nAITAH for pushing her too hard and expecting more? \n\nI also don't feel like I can speak honestly with the manager about it, because they are in a relationship. \n\nSo I'm not really sure where to go from here, I apologised and I'm going to be really careful with how I speak to her as I really do not want to upset her again. However, I am still frustrated by the things I have mentioned above and I don't want to accept them because I simply don't think it is helpful or fair to the rest of the team.\n ",

      "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, and I am unsure how to handle it. In 2021 my father died and 8 months later his mother, my grandmother passed also. My grandmother was really set financially, the house paid off, retirement, I am sure there was a will even though I am being told there was none. My grandmother only had 2 sons . My father had 3 kids, myself (40) being the eldest, my sister (39) and my brother(36), along with her second son my Uncle (65) who has no children and will not. My sister and I live a few states away from the rest of our family, my Grandmother lives in Fresno, CA. When my grandmother died, my uncle didn't tell anyone he posted it on FB, I found out from a family friend calling me to tell me she was sorry. Uncle would not answer the phone to anyone and would not talk to us for over a week after she died, when he did it was to tell my sister and me we needed to get to her house if we wanted anything from her because he was selling the house and it all needed to go. So, we traveled to Fresno to get the few things he would let us have, like end tables, a couple of chairs, and a box of what he said was her jewelry. We opened it later on our way home and found that it was not her jewelry but most likely picked up from a thrift store. We were pretty mad, but we just let it go . We got a few things and luckily, I had gotten a few items of jewelry years before. My sister and I figured there was a will, and the house went to Uncle. Our uncle did not live with my grandmother in all the years she lived in that house, in 2022 he started remodeling the house and sent pics to my mother, late 2022 he moved in with his partner. He sent texts explaining that he decided not to sell but to move in and how much money was spent making it livable. It was a beautiful house, and he ruined it. The problem with this is I know he didn't have the money to remodel a house unless he was using his mother's retirement, before her death she got upset with Uncle because he used the money, she sent him to help pay rent to buy a puppy. Fast forward to 2023, I get court papers in the mail, the house is going through probate. I called Uncle to ask what was going on, and he says as his brother's kids we have to be notified about the change of ownership, here's the kicker on the paperwork, my brother is not on it, and they have my name wrong. I let Uncle know all this and he was like it's not a big deal you guys are just there as family members. Ok, whatever, I probably would have been nosier and more found out as much as I could at that time if I hadn't had so much going on in my life at that time. For the next year we hear nothing again, don't really think much of it, probably all done and over with. It's not,  mid-Oct this year I got a call from Uncle again, well it seems in the state of CA all the hires have to be in the house, him with half because he was her son and the 3 grandkids splitting the other half, which would have been my father's half. Now he is saying the house is part of our inheritance, but he needs us to sign off on the house. Giving up our part is, by doing this the taxes would be the same and would not go up to 20,000 dollars a year and he wouldn't want us to have to pay that for the house because it's in our name. Also, as his only living family, the house would go to us kids when he dies because we are his heirs. That attorney wanted another $15,000 put in an escrow account to keep going in court, that they are fighting, and his attorney thinks that the house should just be sold. Uncle told me to call his attorney if I had questions and get the paperwork to sign off. I told him I would think about it, do some research and get back to him. I did a bit I know my grandmother bought the house in 1998 for $68,000, a steal, it was reassessed at $98,00. Fresno property tax is 1.37% which makes it about $1,500 a year. How did he get $20,000? It's possible that the property tax in Fresno County to jump to 5.0% which is only $5,000 a year. Still not $20,000 but the law says the house has to be reassessed when changing ownership, which would put it closer to $300,000 and 5% of that is $15,000 a year with homeowners' insurance $20,000 makes sense. I looked into the law it says that the only way for the house not to have a reassessment is to go to the child of the owner and it has to be the child's permanent resident. It was not my uncle's permanent residence until 6 months to a year after she passed away, I am pretty sure that makes it still have to go through reassessment even if all 3 of the grandkids sign off. It's been a few weeks, and I really did nothing because I am busy and out of sight, out of mind for me sadly. So I got a text asking me if I was going to sign off like my brother and sister ( my sister is not so I have no clue where that came from ) I told him I had been trying to get a hold of his attorney but he wouldn't call me back, which I have and he hasn't because I wanted to make an informed decision. After that, he went on a whole tirade that he didn't want me messing up his case this late and didn't want me asking his attorney questions and bringing up stuff and how his mother wanted him to have the house. If I was going to push this, he expected a check for $10,000 for the past 2 years of proprty  taxes. I said since you lived in the house rent-free for 2 years, we should fix that also, rent in that area is about $2,000 a month but his family and we will give him a brake so $1,700, x 24 is $40,800. Take away property taxes he paid ( from my grandmother's money no less but I'll give him that) so $35,000 half that is $17,900 divided by 3 is about $6,000 so he should probably have a check in the mail to myself, sister, and brother for that. What I know is that there are things that could happen if we do sign off, we sign off and he dies the next day and we have to go through the next 3 years of probate like he just did, and that even if he willed it to us. Or he sells the house in which we get nothing because we signed off, or he adds his partner to the house and when he dies it goes to whoever he puts on the house, and we still get nothing. I don't want to kick him out, what I want is reassurance that the house will go to the 3 grandkids after he dies, he will not sell it, and if he does it split as it should be half to him and half split 3 ways to the grandkids. He is not in good health and my grandmother worried that the state would come to take the house if it ever went in his name because he has so many states medical bills.  We are not talking now; I am calling a probate attorney in Fresno tomorrow. Also, my name is still wrong on that paperwork, but they did finally add my brothers.",

Over vacations he'd most always get a 5 o'clock shadow and a beard within a week or so (he grows a beard quickly). It was never an issue because he'd have to be clean shaven for work. I like the shadow and think he grows a great beard.  Fast forward to the last maybe 3 years- he switched careers and now works from home- so hasn't needed to be clean shaven. Three years ago it started slow- beard was definitely around and shaving sporadic. But things turned when he started shaving the beard but keeping a mustache. And I absolutely detest a mustache. He had it for a few months and then shave it off (after me begging), last year he had it for probably 6 months before finally shaving it off. This year, he had it from January until October (I rejoiced when it was finally gone). But I just lost it when I went into the bathroom and he was shaving his beard-- and leaving the dang mustache. I got 3 months without a mustache. 3. I'm frustrated, hurt, and honestly repulsed. He knows I can't stand it. No one likes it, not the kids, not his mom, nor his sister. He looks older and the biggest thing-- it's completely unkempt. Food gets in it, water literally dribbles out when he drinks. It hangs over his lip. It's horrible. I've begged, I've stayed quiet, I've yelled, I've reminded him- numerous times- I didn't marry someone with a mustache, I've asked him why he likes it, tried to compromise on time. Nothing. He won't shave it. Absolutely does not care I hate it. Says its his body and he can do what he wants-- great, but really? If he asked me to do something/not do something, I would. Because why not. Would really like to know if I'm being too much. Thanks.",

We are there for about a week, within this time we learn a lot. Including that our landlord is on probation and has had over 45+ roommates in n out in the past year (red flag), the oven does not work and his microwave was infested.

I asked if I could paint and fix the giant whole in our wall from previous roommates and he said yes! \"I will take it out of rent\" so of course I buy the plaster and paint, not ever a day after I fifinish the plaster he tells me the paint will not benefit him so he will not be taking it out of rent. I was so frustrated i still have not painted that room and honestly ddon't plan on it.\n\nOne day I finally broke down about the bugs and he just goes off on me. Saying he can just evict me because I'm starting problems aka me asking him to take care of his roach problem. And no the roaches are not from us, he told us he's been living with them for years. He also randomly told us he found bedbugs, HUGE no no because my boyfriend is allergic! Of course we were not told about those either when we moved in.\n\nA month goes by, he gets another roommate, doesn't mention anything to me or my boyfriend. Starts asking her for the same things but she did buy him a new microwave that is of course infested like his original one.  He also never mentioned anything to the new roommate about the bugs. The new roommate is starting to realize that all his shit talk on us isn't true and now knows why we are in our room almost 24/7, which she has now also started to do.\n\nI literally just want this man to get pest control so I can make food without 10 damn roaches falling in it.\n\nI live in michigan, don't know if that helps. I'd honestly appreciate any help on this because I'm at a loss. I do have pictures of him threatening eviction over ne asking him about the roaches.\n\n\n\nI do also want to mention me and my boyfriend moved in two months ago, our landlord JUST got a job like today.",

      "selftext": "I\u2019m a 24-year-old female living in India, and today, I had to call out my ex-crush. It's been months since we stopped talking, and I was the one who ended the friendship. He was constantly gaslighting me, guilt-tripping me, and making me feel worthless. He also took advantage of the fact that I had a crush on him. I was completely done with his hot-and-cold behavior and his refusal to ever admit his mistakes.\n\nTo make matters worse, he dumped his ex, who was a genuinely sweet girl, by saying, \u201cI still don\u2019t have feelings for you,\u201d after dating her for a year. It was her first relationship, and she was devastated\u2014so much so that she needed therapy for a month. Despite this, they stayed friends because he didn\u2019t want to break the bond (ugh, what an ahole). Even his best friend eventually distanced himself from him because he constantly meddled in his relationship, telling him things like, \u201cYou should dump her before she leaves you.\u201d His best friend also went through a lot emotionally because of him and faced a situation similar to mine.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets worse. His best friend was the first person I confided in about my crush, and, of course, he told him. After that, my ex-crush became even more flirty, despite already having a girlfriend. I told him multiple times to respect boundaries and not touch me, reminding him that he was in a relationship. Do you know what he had the audacity to say? \u201cMy girlfriend doesn\u2019t have a problem, so why should you?\u201d\n\nI was so close to slapping him that day, but instead, I calmly said, \u201cIt\u2019s my body, my choice.\u201d That incident happened a long time ago, but it stuck with me.\n\nYesterday, his ex-girlfriend (who knows nothing about why our friendship ended) confronted me, asking why we had stopped talking. I finally told her the truth. She was, understandably, pissed off, especially when I shared how he had been flirty while they were together. To be fair, his flirty nature was tolerable when he was single, but it was absolutely inappropriate in a relationship.\n\nThis morning, he called me, furious, demanding to know what I had told his ex. I responded, \u201cSo, you\u2019re angry because you\u2019ve been exposed?\u201d He didn\u2019t even bother to hear me out. Instead, he hung up and blocked me on all platforms. I was left thinking, The fvcking audacity of this guy!",

      "selftext": "My best mate and I bought a house together in 2019. Both of us male and 20 at the time. I put in 20k to the deposit and him 5k. I cared about him at the time and still do so I wanted to give him a good deal. As a result I said when it comes to selling the house we would take our deposits and split all further proceeds 50:50. \n\nWhen I arranged this I wasn't expecting the UK housing market to go quite as mad as it did but anyway, 5 years have passed and the house has appreciated about 50k-60k in value. 40% increase in 5 years. \n\nI should point out that at the time I was living with my parents and being bullied by my older brother, so I was really desperate to leave.\nAbout a year after we bought the place my mate asked his girlfriend (same age) to move in with him. I'm sure you can guess where this is going. I think I may have to stick this on r/AITAH as well.\n\nShe had moved in while finishing her degree during COVID and then went into a training year as a teacher. During this she wasn't being paid. (Except for the student loans and grants) \n\nDuring this time I said she could live there free of charge as long as she tidied after herself given she wasn't earning. \n\nWhen she did start to earn I requested that she pay 20% of the living cost while me and Alex would split the remaining costs. This means she started paying \u00a3250 per month only after 18months of living in the house for nothing. This has increased to \u00a3350p/m giving increased cost of living in the last 5 years. This is to cover all her portion of all living costs so includes not just the house, energy bills and utilities, but also, all the groceries.\n\nAs time went on they gradually (both my mate and his girlfriend) stopped tidying up after themselves. I don't like mess, it stresses me out. Aside from basic stuff like cleaning the dishes they use, his girlfriend is also  into cosplay so often takes up the living room while making her new costumes or props and doesn't tidy up after herself. This renders the whole room unusable because there isn't enough floor the step across let alone that she leaves glass tipped sewing pins scattered about the place which I can't see in the carpet because I'm short sighted. \n\nOver the past five years, I have been desperately asking them both more and more frequently to tidy up after their mess and leave shared spaces as they find them. I hate confrontation following my relationship with my brother so just asking feels hard to do. My friend is unhappy about it but generally gets on with it when asked. His girlfriend however becomes defensive and says she too busy and doesn't have the energy for it. Tells me I'm disrespectful for asking her to tidy up after herself. Tells me it doesn't make her feel welcome.\n\nFinally, the last piece of context for you. I don't like Christmas. Not specifically Christmas itself, there is a lot to enjoy on the day. It's the prolonged lead up accompanied by the worst music available. When I was young my dad was an alcoholic and as mentioned I was bullied by brother as well. On top of this we were poor so all my presents were shared gifts. Much love to my parents, my dad no longer drinks and is doing very well but, I've got plenty of trauma in the Christmas period and Christmas decorations and music are triggering for me so I ask that we don't put any up in our house until mid December. \n\nMy mates girlfriend loves Christmas and every single year has gone behind my back and bought a tree in the first week of December. My mate has put her wants before mine every year so far. This year in February of 2024 I started being very unwell. Turns out picking up all the pressure of keeping a house of three occupants tidy, working a full time job, and trying to study for master will give you stress induced IBS so now when I'm stressed I vomit and struggle with my bowels.\n\nSo this year they once again went out and bought a tree behind my back. When they returned with it, I told them how upset I was that they were going behind my back, and how they don't seem to care about my needs at all. I told them, they're not putting the tree up until they've finished clearing up after themselves. I won't let them add stress to my life until they've subtracted the stress they've caused by never tidying up afterthem selves. \n\nAgain, my mates girlfriend got angry with me and said that I can't tell them what to do and that I'm not their parents. I told them that may be true but regardless, legally, I have no responsibility to let her live in my house at all and that I'm giving her a  remarkably good deal and that if she wants to keep living in my house then that's part of the deal because I can't have the house a mess as well as being reminded of some of my worst memories because it will make me sick. \n\nThe conversation eventually became heated and the stress of the conversation alone has made me unwell all day but, my mate did the following day begin to clear up and nothing more was said. His girlfriend just left the house.\n\n I go to my parents for a meal because my mom knows I'm stressed out and wants to make sure I'm eating properly (my brother now lives in London which is hours away so that's not a problem anymore). When I return home from dinner the tree is up in the living which has been cleared up but the kitchen is still in the same disgusting state. \n\nI just saw it, picked it up decorations and all, and put it back into the garage reminding them what I'd said the previous day that they can have it up once they were done. Of course this has upset them both my mate especially because he actually did put some effort in during the day. Ive ended up leaving and going back to my parents so I can try to calm down and not feel so sick. \n\nI feel like I'm not asking the world here and I've let them get their way for 5 of the 6 Decembers already but this one is different for me because of the IBS. They're making me feel like the worst person alive and again saying I have no respect for them. Ill be the first to admit that I'm socially awkward, thanks I think to the bullying but, I think my actions speak loudest. I've given my mate a favourble deal for equity (which gives him about 11k more than he'd have under the standard arrangement and his girlfriend only had to pay 350 a month for all her living costs. Where else can you get a deal like that no money down?\n\nMy plan tomorrow is to begin the procedures to put the house on the market so we can go separate ways. I also want to see if I can have his girlfriend moved out before then as she gives me nothing but grief. I'm devastated because I think I've lost my best mate over this. I don't regret giving him the deal. I still want the best for him, I just wish they could recognise how nice I was trying to be because now I really fell like the bad guy but Im not sure I should. \n\nTLDR: don't buy a house with a mate unless you're really desperate like I was. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "Okay. So. I have noticed that every time my boyfriend (30m) takes Sildenafil, we get into a fight. He has ADHA and takes vyvanse most days (Monday-Friday). On days he takes Sildenafil, we get into a fight about one thing or another. I literally made a joke last time I gave him one and said we couldn\u2019t fight today.  Today, I gave him a pill because it\u2019s been a good 4-6 days since we were last active. I like to have sex everyday but he is good once or twice a week. \nWe got into a fight about DoorDash tonight\u2026 like, the most trivial thing. I swear he is the kindest, most considerate, sweetest man. We hardly ever fight. He literally left and got me top ramen because I was craving it at 1:30am the other night. He left right before the store closed to get it for me. \n\nBut when he takes Sildenafil, we almost always fight. I gave it to him today after not having sex for awhile and we got into a fight around 7-8pm about ordering DoorDash. I suggested we order before things close and he said nothing so I called my mom to talk about school work and he interrupts and after awhile he said places were about to close. I immediately hung up the phone and placed my order. When I gave him his phone back, he said it was too late and they were closing. One thing lead to another and the fight processed (from his prospective it\u2019s because I made it sound urgent and then it wasn\u2019t urgent) when I told him I notice we fight when he takes the Sildenafil. He got very angry at me and said he won\u2019t stand for it. He said he never brings up my medication (Zoloft) when we fight. \n\nAITAH in this situation?? He has ADHD and when I ask him something, if he\u2019s in the middle of something else, he\u2019ll take several minutes before replying. I didn\u2019t think it would be a problem for me to call someone while I wait. \n\nTl;dr, does Sildenafil make anyone grumpy or has anyone noticed they fight with their boyfriend when they take this? Just looking for other similar stories. Any advice would be appreciated. ",

      "selftext": "this isn't really an AITA story, I guess it can kinda be though. \n\nSo, I'm posting this on an anonymous account because I really don't know what to do and don't want friends finding it.\n\nI'm not gonna drop any ages here (just for reference everyone mentioned in this story, other than parents, are high-school aged)\n\nI (they/them) have been friends with two people that I am proud enough to call my twins/brothers (no actual relation) for about a year or so, almost 2 now.\n\nWe've had our ups and downs. Me and the one older than me, we'll call him Jasper, (Trans Male), instantly got very close because of a mutual friend, similar relationships, and because of a fallout with a friend group. He's my lifeline, which is where I think the problem lies, but we'll get into that after I even explain what happened. The younger one, we'll call, Kyle (Male), originally was not as close with us, because of some mental struggles he's been having. He's relatively younger than me and Jasper, and we have had to teach him about a few boundaries and respect towards LGBTQ+ people and people with mental disabilities. This incident (if anyone wants me to after posting this, I can sum up a few of the things that happened regarding this) severely drew us away from him until late 2023, early 2024, because he was very disrespectful to me and Jasper before learning why saying certain things werent okay and coming to a happy medium with me and Jasper. Kyle is a great kid otherwise, and I see him as a little brother to me. Around mid 2024, me, Jasper, and Kyle got very close, and after calling Jasper my 'twin' for a while, and becoming his bestfriend, Kyle joined that circle, and we became 'twinsies' / triplets.  \n\nNow, some deeper details.\n\nI have had several diagnosed eating disorders in the past, and I have been diagnosed with OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), MDD (Major Depressive Disorder), and GAD (General Anxiety Disorder). I am getting tested for ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) currently. I have major problems regulating, focusing, registering information, remembering information, isolating, attaching to others, and deescalating. I know that sounds major, but for me, I'm happy that's all. \n\nI am recovering from heavy use of alcohol and weed, and I currently go to therapy bi-weekly. \n\nJasper is diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and is being tested for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). He is also taking hormone blockers. He has a rough situation at home, and his girlfriend (Trans Fem) , who we'll call Flower, has it ten times worse than him and has high-functioning autism. \n\nJasper also goes to therapy bi-weekly.\n\nMe and Jasper see Kyle as our little brother we are effortlessly trying to bring up right. We typically say that we want to bring him up better than us, and I completely get it. We did not go through the best things growing up (SA, etc), and while Kyle did too, we don't want him to be at a point where he is taking as much medication as we do, being sent away, or using substances. \n\nNow, fast forward to yesterday. \n\nI woke up around 5am to find that Jasper and Kyle were still awake (Jasper sick, Kyle not able to sleep.) We talked for a little bit, and I told them to go back to bed (I had slept for the entire day the day prior, so I was more than well-rested.) Jasper went back to bed until around 8am, and Kyle didn't (he played on the game instead). Me, Jasper, and Kyle, were planning to go to movies to watch a popular showing (I won't say it here because if they ever see this post it will be obvious that I'm talking about it here). for about a week or so prior to. Yesterday was the day that we would finally go. I was up at 5am, so I decided to get ready ahead of time (the outfit was planned out for about 5 days because I was excited to finally hang out). We were excited, and getting ready to go, when I mentioned on the phone with Kyle that all the seats in the theater were taken. \n\nAnother important note might be that Kyle's parent never booked the tickets. When we realized this we instantly started trying to figure out what we would do. We devised the plan that we would drive to a different movie theater to go see the movie, but Kyle's parent, again, refused to book ahead.\n\nWith that being said, I changed my mind on going to the different movie theater, as to where Kyle ultimately refused to still go to the original one and just hang out instead of going to the different theater to see the movie.\n\nJasper, up at this point (around 8:30 am) was indifferent and just wanted to know what we were planning to do.\n\nMy mom decided to book a different location where we'd have fun stuff to do together afterwards, however, Jasper's parents also refused, saying the location was too far. Kyle's parents also said no because they needed a babysitter for Kyle's siblings and couldn't change the time for the babysitter to be there.\n\nFor some context, the location would be 34 minutes from Jasper, and the original location was 33 minutes away from him. (Little to no difference)\n\nUltimately, we decided to just go to the original movie theater and hang out. However, Jasper's parents unexpectedly, changed their mind, going to the store and a restaurant about the same distance away instead.\n\nNow, this is where it gets bad. After Jasper's parents randomly decided to make the event, I guess, more about them than the kids, Kyle got overwhelmed, and at this point, I was already on the verge of breaking down. Kyle basically said forget it and shut down on the both of us. He left 2 of our main group chats and I followed after realizing.\nThat is where I feel bad.\n\nAfter, I had a breakdown to the point of almost vomiting and violently coughing, blaming myself for the situation and attempting to just get undressed and shut down on myself completely (didnt work because having that bad of a breakdown gets everyones attention). My friends dont know that part, but it happened, and it happened badly. That was the worst breakdown Ive had in a while, and I feel like it set me back a peg.\n\nAfterwards, Jasper basically stopped responding to me. Kyle's parents called me to address the situation, and I heard from Kyle for a while, and also Jasper for a while. However, it has been about 10 hours since I have heard from either of them. I am starting to think that I was the cause of the situation, and I have either been burdening them by venting too much, or by breaking down the way I did today. We did not hang out, and I have to see Jasper tomorrow. I don't know if he wants to see me or not, and they have read my messages several times, but no response.\n\nAITA or is there an A-hole here?? What would you do in my situation?",

I've always made sure she had a roof over her head, paid the bills, drive her to and from work while working myself. \n\nI've tried my best to always be there and always be supportive. The past month two things have now happened that maybe I'm making a bigger deal of than I should...\n\nOne is I took a week of vacation after getting a CT scan for Lymphoma, she worked literally all 7 days in a row. One of which she was off and offered to go In....\n\nNext was this morning, there's a band Slowdive, I had tickets to see them years ago in Toronto but couldn't make it, regretted it every since as I'm a massive fan. I got the notice they were playing here but it was sold out. When she asked what I wanted for Xmas it was to go to that show with her. \n\nWell 4:00am I got q notification 2 balcony seats became available, knowing I had to grab them fast I was super excited. She told me she doesn't want to go, I've been in music my whole life and sharing this kind of thing is important to me, unfortunately my best friend passed away 2 years ago and really, she's never been to anything like this, I even said I'll buy the tickets myself, I don't even care about presents, still a hard no.\n\nSo screw, I'm going alone, bought my own ticket and told her not to bother getting me anything.\n\n Am I an asshole for feeling like s*** about this.

Maddie was 14 F too and was kind of a B for some background info she would always let her friends bully me and would ghost me for no reason and whenever she was made at me would talk about a hangout or sleepover with our other friend Gabi (14 F) to make me jealous . Back to the main story we were having a sleepover when she left the room and came back 10 minutes later saying she invited Gabi over to make the sleepover less boring , I\u2019m not sure if it was bad for me to be offended by that but anyways gabi came over and her and Maddie were basically ignoring me expect for when they decided to tease me .

      "selftext": "So, I (26F) love to write. Ever since I was a kid, storytelling has been my favorite creative outlet. Recently, I started posting on Reddit, mostly on subs like AITA or relationship advice. My posts have been getting a lot of attention, which feels amazing, but here\u2019s the thing: the stories I post are fictional. They\u2019re inspired by the people in my life, but they\u2019re not real.\n\nFor example, if my sister (28F) is late to lunch, I might write a post about a fictional sibling who keeps flaking on plans. Or if my mom forgets to call me back, I might create a story about a parent who doesn\u2019t prioritize their kids. The characters are loosely based on real people, but I change all the details to make them unrecognizable. To me, it\u2019s just a way to exercise my creativity while engaging with a community that loves stories as much as I do.\n\nI never thought it was a big deal\u2014after all, they\u2019re just stories, and I didn\u2019t think anyone would take them personally. But last week, my best friend (27F) somehow stumbled upon one of my posts and recognized that the \u201cinspiration\u201d came from her, even though the events were entirely fictional. She got really upset and said I was being disrespectful by using our friendship as material for public stories, even if I wasn\u2019t naming names.\n\nShe told a couple of other friends, and now things have spiraled. My sister is upset, saying it feels like I\u2019m writing about her behind her back, even though I\u2019ve never revealed anything personal or real. My mom says she feels like I\u2019m \u201cputting words in her mouth.\u201d Some of my friends think it\u2019s inappropriate to use them as inspiration, even in a fictional context.\n\nI never meant to hurt anyone. I genuinely thought of this as harmless fun\u2014just a way to work on my writing and connect with people online. I didn\u2019t think anyone in my life would ever see these stories, let alone feel hurt by them. I feel awful, but at the same time, I\u2019m struggling to understand if what I did was really wrong.\n\nAITAH for turning bits of my life into fictional stories for Reddit, or are my friends and family overreacting?",

      "selftext": "I have never posted here before, but I have been really anxious about an interaction I had yesterday. \nFor context, I used to shop at Sephora, but I stopped because small children would be running around the store wreaking havoc. Since then, I have transferred over to Ulta for the most part. \nWhen I say \u201cSephora Kid,\u201d I am referring to the colloquial definition of a \u201cSephora Kid\u201d and do not mean that we were in Sephora.\n\nYesterday I (21) went to an Ulta to pick up some conditioner. I then got distracted and kept on trying different lip products. They only had the lip tester tools at one station in the back (which I kept going to and from). Eventually I came back to the back and saw two kids with some pink boba drinks. We were next to the Drunk Elephant section. Suddenly, I noticed a box of the Polypeptide cream (the teal one) in the trash can. I get along with all the employees at this Ulta who have met me, so I went over to let them know that I was concerned that I suddenly saw the box in the trash can (especially considering the high price of the cream and that it was the last one left as well as simple moral principles). They thanked me a million times.\nTurns out the kids had opened it to make a \u201cskincare smoothie\u201d and essentially wrecked the top. In addition to this, they misplaced the lid of the product and tried to replace it with a Tula cap. I helped the staff out with the cap situation, but then we saw the kids go past us again, so I made sure to point at them and be like \u201cyeah!! that is them!!\u201d because up until this point, they were just going off my description. Based off of what I witnessed, it seems as if the mother only took responsibility after I pointed them out in particular. \nShe had the kids apologize, but they really did not want to. Ever since this happened though, I have been worried that maybe I took it too far by vocalizing and pointing to them? I am not the best with social cues or norms or whatnot, and my pointing and vocalizing that it was those two was essentially a reflex that I didn\u2019t even think twice about until after it happened. \nPlease let me know what you think! AITAH? What would you have done in this situation?",

      "selftext": "My husband (32 M) has been having medical problems (I feel like he might be milking them) since 2019. He hasn't had a job and just gives excuses left and right about not getting one. Since 2019, I've worked multiple jobs at once and went to college at the same time. I've lost several jobs and there was a time during the pandemic where we were homeless. That year he also donated a kidney to his father and further used it as an excuse to why he couldn't help me make ends meet. After I eventually started making enough money to move into a new apartment. He swore up and down that he would help, but he never did and I relied on charities for years to pay rent. He then insisted we take in his sister's child who she abandoned at the hospital. Stating that \"children were easy to take care of\" and that he would take on the responsibility. However, the baby didn't sleep for four whole days at one point. I was forced to stay home from work and I lost my job. Now I'm back to job hopping again, hoping that something sticks. He then said that we needed to move into a bigger home since we had the baby and that he would help with rent. I am now in severe debt that I'll probably never crawl out of and I cannot keep up with rent due to this. \n\nBack in June I had gone on tiktok on our family tablet and had it suggest a random channel to me that sounded familiar. I hadn't seen it before, but the names struck me as similar to a random email my husband made. I figured out how to log into it and realized that he had been using tiktok during the pandemic to watch underage girls dance on the app. Some of them were sexually suggestive (one where a girl flashes her breasts through a reflection on a window). I brought this up to him as well as the fact that I had found him paying for porn when we're homeless too. He got angry and started throwing things at me; which included a chair. He smashed my laptop and stormed out, saying he was gonna kill himself. He then came back crying and saying he didn't remember any of it. He claims he has DID. I should mention at the this point that we haven't had sex in 4 years because he claims he's asexual and that his penis doesn't work due to his medical condition. \n\nRecently, his dad was diagnosed with leukemia and has been in and out of the hospital in the past month. I went to go use the WIC card today to get formula for the now toddler, but the card didn't work. When I called my husband (and I was reasonably upset), I was met with \"I haven't slept in two days. I can't believe that you'd expect me to be perfect and remember to renew the WIC card\". (For more context. The toddler is austic due to being born addicted to drugs thanks to my husband's sister. He doesn't eat solid food and this is almost his only form of food. The formula comes out $80/box)\n\nI really don't think I'm the asshole here, but it really feels like my husband doesn't actually care about me or the child he's forced me to take care of. \n\nSide note: I recently found a new job and I can't request a weekday off to take care of the WIC card or they'll fire me. I'm a commercial HVAC tech. This means I work very long shifts going up and down ladders all day. ",

      "selftext": "So I (21F) and my boyfriend (27) male have only been dating for 2 months but have been seeing each other for 8. Now we did not ask or disclose any sexual conditions or anything of that nature when we started being active which was a few days after we met. basically FWB turned relationship,  but he did know that I was clean from all STDs because I did get tested about 3 weeks into us seeing each other. \n\nThis week I had been sick and following me being sick I got a cold sore. \nUnfortunately I never got it from kissing or sharing anything so it was very weird on how I contracted HSV-1.  I went to a lake in the summer when I was 14 and 2 days later my lip was 3x the size to the point I was drooling over myself.  Every once in a while I get it in the same place so the sore does not move any other places on my mouth. \nWhere I\u2019m from and I\u2019m not exaggerating but everyone gets cold sores, like it\u2019s a normal thing. I was also taught that as long as you didn\u2019t share or kiss while HSV-1 is active then it was fine. Not even in health class did they teach me that cold sores were herpes. I even went to the doctor and circled it on my paperwork and the doctors told me it was not the same thing as the herpes they were asking about and that I had nothing to worry about. \n\nBack to the story though, so the morning of I felt it tingling and sometimes that happens but a  cold sore isn\u2019t coming on so I was like let me watch it throughout the day. I pecked my boyfriend on the lips before going to work and I felt a small bump later on in the day. I texted him and he flipped on me saying I gave him an STD and why wouldn\u2019t I tell him that I had herpes before being together\u2026. I got mad and went off on him because I felt it was a personal attack like I ruined his life. Which I get that Herpes is life altering and it changes you forever but none of it was intentional like he was making it sound and I wasn\u2019t trying to purposefully give it to him, I told him that he would\u2019ve already gotten it during the 8 months that we\u2019ve been together and he just didn\u2019t want to see it from where I was coming from. \n\nMy coworkers and family told me he was overreacting and that the cold sore is a thing that happens to everyone but mind you like I said, where I\u2019m from everyone has it like on the regular and I think both my family and coworkers also deal with it so maybe it\u2019s the norm for how common it is where I\u2019m from. \n\nHe talked about getting a blood test and the roommate he lives with talked about suing me because we shared a vape about 2 weeks ago and that I didn\u2019t let the roommate know. \n\nSo what I want to know from the whole thing is AITA for not letting him know? I apologized and let him know that I was uneducated about the matter but I also feel it was his lack of asking\u2026. We both didn\u2019t do our due diligence on the matter but now I feel that this is a make or break situation. ",

      "selftext": "My husband and I have been together for almost 15 years. The vast majority of that time, he\u2019s smoked pot. This wasn\u2019t a huge deal back in the day and I smoked some as well, still vape every once in a while, recreationally. But my husband has been using it all day, every day, for years. It\u2019s how he gets through his day and he\u2019s lied to me about it countless times for apparently no reason at all. When he started lying about it, I was so confused, because I would smell it on him and he would just lie to my face about it. \n\nA few months ago, he got laid off, and he\u2019s been looking for work since, but mostly because I\u2019ve monitored his job search and have made all of his resumes. Aside from a few applications here and there, I\u2019m not even sure what he\u2019s been doing with his time. We got in a huge fight a couple of weeks ago bc something I\u2019d been asking him to do for weeks never got done and it ended up costing us a lot of money. I absolutely lost it, not to mention all the stuff that needed to be fixed around the house, hadn\u2019t gotten fixed despite him having all this time off, and me being on him about the repairs every day. \n\nSomething wasn\u2019t connecting and I finally was like, look, I think it\u2019s the weed. It tricks you into thinking everything\u2019s ok and zaps your motivation. Ntm I suspect it could be the cause of his crazy mood swings. \n\nWell that lasted all of three days and he came clean about it, but seemed to think that it was ok he started back because \u201cat least he didn\u2019t lie to me about it.\u201d\n\nFF to today when, having been sick most of the weekend, I walk out to find the house a disaster, for no reason. Of all the time he has on his hands, it doesn\u2019t seem like a lot to ask to keep the house clean since I\u2019m the only one working, so I\u2019m rarely home. I reignited the conversation about pot again and he LOST IT. He even decided it would be a good idea to bring up my abusive ex who had a drug problem of his own. I had to forgive him for my own peace, but my husband has always had this weird complex about me \u201cforgiving\u201d him for myself. So tonight he asked me why I seemingly had more sympathy for someone who beat me up, than I do for him. I was like\u2026.wtf? First of all, I left that guy, and I forgave him to myself, FOR myself, YEARS before I ever even met my husband, because otherwise I wanted to die. This is all a pretty sensitive topic for me but I tend to surround myself with people who use things I tell them about myself against me, so, I probably should\u2019ve never told him in the first place, which is on me.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019d had enough. I told him if he doesn\u2019t stop smoking weed, we\u2019re over. I never thought I\u2019d be willing to throw such a long relationship out the window over marijuana but here we are. AITAH for giving him such an ultimatum? He seems to think I\u2019m not being fair to him, or empathetic to his mental state, but he\u2019s using pot as a crutch. If he was using it recreationally, I wouldn\u2019t give two fucks. But he uses it ALL DAY, every day, and I swear it fucks with his moods bc if he\u2019s not high, he can\u2019t be normal. ",

Abuse and Self Harm\n\nIf my misspelling is off, I apologize because I literally was up for 24/7 because of this nonsense of what I\u2019m about to tell you. \n\nOkay so I (21f) and Alicia (21f) have known each other since middle school. Our friendship has some ups and downs to a point that she even blocked me at one point (although we are on good terms atm). Throughout the recent years I\u2019ve discovered that she has borderline personality disorder. I now understand why she has her \u201csplit\u201d moments. \n\nNow here is the real problem tho\u2026 After when I helped her get out of an abusive relationship with her fianc\u00e9 Devyn (24M), she became extremely needy. I know it\u2019s gonna sound wrong but please hear me out. When she vents to me about when something goes wrong, she would get suicidal and threaten to harm herself. When I told her that maybe she needs to go to a mental hospital for some extra help, she started screaming at me on the phone. While she was screaming at me, I hung up the call because I\u2019ll admit, that triggered my PTSD. About 2 hours later she apologized to me sincerely, and told me that she had a split moment. She thought that I was abandoning her all because I mentioned about her going to a mental hospital. I accepted her apology after the blow out.\n\n2 months after when she got out of the relationship, her new fianc\u00e9 Kyle (30m) she is now having problems with him all because he is in prison. She literally keeps on texting me everyday, and it\u2019s driving me batshit crazy. It\u2019s so bad that I even had to mute her so I wouldn\u2019t get notifications from her. Not to mention that if I respond to her two seconds late, she\u2019ll be like \u201cSorry to bother you, I won\u2019t bother you again\u201d. Like dude, I can\u2019t even use my own bathroom in peace for like 2 seconds? I am seriously considering blocking her for good out of my life because it\u2019s all so draining to me. But then again, she told me that I was one of her longest friends and that she\u2019ll be devastated. She made serious suicidal threats before to point that it gets me scared that I don\u2019t know what to say. But if I say the wrong thing like go to a mental hospital, she\u2019ll have her split moment on me again. So please be honest with me. AITA for considering blocking her? ",

      "selftext": "Should I 31F marry my Fianc\u00e9 30M after I found he has been messaging other women?\n\n  I don\u2019t really know where to start... I am meant to be marrying my Fianc\u00e9 next year but not sure i can go through with it. I am scared of making the wrong decision. I guess I need to explain from the beginning of our relationship. I've been with my Fianc\u00e9 for just over 7 years, we have lived together for 6 of that and engaged for 3 years. I love this man more than anyone I have ever loved and don't know if I could ever love a man more. We had it really good, like crazy mad for each other and it felt like we didn't get out of the honeymoon stage. We was unseparable from the moment we first met, it was like we'd been together for years. We just knew each other Soulmates from the beginning. But there had been problems been some issues from the start, he smoked weed and i wasn't someone who was ever into it. But the longer I was with him, I started to smoke it myself and was doing it more & more. That was his thing and I like to enjoy spending time with him so it ended up being our chill thing together.  As years got on I've become more and more dependent on it. I'm aware I need to stop and said we both need to stop & support each other but always ends up going back to it. It was my way of forgetting things, we have always struggled financially as a couple.  We always have problems with work, either can't hold one down or get enough hours. I have a career and done pretty well for myself.  I'm not saying I'm well off but earn enough to have saving a do a few nice things. However because he always struggled couldn't save or just havw the drive strive better, i would always end up helping him cover his side of the bills. I would say out of our while 6 years together at least 5 years I have helped him financially some way or another.  Now I totally understand we all go through bad patches and things don't always go the way you planned. But when do you draw the line? Like don't get me wrong I am all for support to help someone better themselves.  He doesn't have like a skill or trade, his thing that strives him to a career. I, his mum and my family have offered support for training but he does nothing.  Always uses the excuse I don't have the money(each one of us has either offered to pay full or part towards it) I speak to him about it, offer words of encouragement, try to spark ideas of what he wants to do, what jobs etc. Its almost like he closes himself off or can't be bothered or even just happy for me to cover his side financially and  have it the easy way. I have ways just pushed through it hoping one day he finds it and keep saying to myself you have to.go through the bad to enjoy the good.  Trying to keep positive as I felt so lucky to be with a man who loves me so much and it's us against the world. Well until May this year. \n\nSome time in May we had been talking about for quite a while, years in fact about exploring doing threesomes. I had one previous to our relationship and my Fianc\u00e9 hadn't.  We agreed after much thought about exploring together before we marry so neither of us felt like there was things we missed out on or wanted to explore sexually. We both decided boundaries which was each try mmf & ffm once each. Including we must do both not exclusively one so it is not one sided. We both said if anyone got uncomfortable we stop and we only talk as a 3 in the same chat and not separately so we both can see the conversations. So we started to speak to another F can't remember her age. Things went well and we set a date. We both made it clear what we wanted to try and agreed to stop of not comfortable.  Things went well and we had fun. We did end up finishing a but sooner than expected as I hurt my leg and was in a lot of pain. But nevertheless he had sex with her and touched her. Now going on to mmf as I said we agreed to do both and only fair of we experienced both.  So same thing  as before we started speaking to someone and set up a group chat together. This time was a bit different,  he got a bit upset and couldn't handle another guy talking to me. He also said he wasn't sure what he wanted to explore or what he was comfortable doing from a mm side but wasn't happy doing a mmf with a straight m. The longer we was talking to another m he was getting cold feet about it. I was a bit upset he had changed his mind after we agreed if we do one then we do the other. But after thought I understood and we stopped.  At the same time I discovered something I would of never thought in a million years would happen.  One day I was going down his gallery on his phone to look at our holiday pictures from Italy in February as I knew he had some he didn't send me.(we have an open phone policy ) To find a load of explict pictures of woman,  now I've seen he has that kind of thing in his phone before as an ex work colleague sends him stuff. What Man doesn't have at least one friend who does it. Well to be sure I looked at where the source of the image was from, to find where he had been sent it. Straight away my stomach dropped, I felt sick to the bone and couldn't believe what I was seeing. He had been sending messages on different social media accounts,  i even found a fake accounts. He had been sending private messages to other woman making comments about their tits, asking for their Snapchat and had even asked & send pictures including nudes. I was totally heart broken, felt like he had ripped my heart up into a million pieces and thrown it all away. I spoke to him right away and asked why & what was going on. All he kept saying was sorry and he didn't know why he did it. That he loves me and wants to be with me. But these messages had spaned over a 18 months.  I was so hurt and asked for space. Which we both did but my head & heart was fighting each other. All he said after we had some time away was that he was lonely and that is why he did it. Even though we had a pretty decent sex life, he was lying in bed next to be messaging these girls. It made me feel so ugly and unwanted that he would rather message strangers than wake me up. I had even told him many times he could wake me up.  Well after a week I decided to move past this and try to rebuild our relationship.  We stopped with mmf exploration and just really work on our relationship.  We was due to get married in June next year and had a holiday booked for September this year. About 5 to 6 weeks went by still trying to move on even with a few disagreements. Things were really tough he was barely getting enough money to cover 2/3 of the bills and struggling to get the hours at work. At this point I really started to lose my faith and fuse with it all. Thinking nothing could get worse. Until I found more chats, I was on his tablet as mine was dead and it's my old tablet anyway so we always just share things no need to ask. I go onto the files as it had an email of my still logged it and I was hoping to see if I had a file with passwords on. Well what I found was something I most definitely thought i wouldn't find again, images of another woman. This time it was a load of screen recordings he's done from a live stream. Now I don't have a problem with him watching porn but to be watching a chat stream and screen recording videos up to 20 mins at a time knowing I'm next to him in bed, just made me feel so unwanted again and wondering what the hell I'm doing. I also find he had been joing adult groups on Facebook and been making comments about womans tits & body that he has never said to me before.  All I've done is give and support, to have him constantly throwing it back in my face. I never ask for anything but to love me and not break my trust. I don't demand for gifts,  treats or trips. I am a pretty independent woman and if I want something I will pay for it myself. We go out for dinner i often pay for it or we halfs. Just really broke me, all I want as I said to be loved but I'm now questioning is that enough. Should I be treated like a princess and not be made to feel unwanted after all that he has done to be on multiple occasions.  We are due to go away in September as its his 30th birthday, I've paid near over 2k for the holiday as I always like to make him feel special. But then I remember when it was my 30th the year before it took him 9 months after my birthday to get me a present and he did nothing only a card but not even get me a cake for it. As I've been questioning more and more what am I doing i start to feel it's been very one sided relationship.  All I do is give and he takes with little return. He says he loves me gives me hugs makes me a cup of tea and dinner now and again. But that's as far as it goes. I guess some people don't even get that, but I want more. I want to be made to feel special.  Going  back to the 2nd time I find these messages, after much thought I gave him an ultimatum that he need to sort his financial situation either get bitter job or second job or whatever to ensure he has the stability to pay the bills each month. I also said i don't ever want to find these kind of messages or him making comments like that again as I was uncomfortable with it. I gave him 2 months to start making an improvement which I thought is fair. We had also had been trying for a baby before all these messages were discovered wirh no luck. I had done some testing but needed him to do some. I had waited 10 months for him to even book the Dr's appointment.  So I said he needed to sort this out also. He agreed with all these actions and said he would prove it to me. I wanted our relationship to work so badly. I believe things don't come easy and we all have to work at things. But there does come a point where I feel the relationship is unsalvageable. But I had to give it one more shot, I mean I love him and still waited to get married to him. Although I was starting to have my doubts. \n\nHe gets a new job, a bartender which he was doing previously.  Crap hours but we both understand so we can save for the wedding and pay the bills. Things are going well, he is starting to get funds behind him. Getting regular hours and things are looking up. We have our holiday in September and have a great time with him, his Mum  & Step  Dad  and Auntie too.  Who I get on very well with. I can safely say I have a good mother in law, she is family to me and she calls me her daughter.  Last month we celebrated our 7th Anniversary we didn't do much as he didn't have loads of money due to being off work from an injury.  But nevertheless we had a nice time. Now this injury i won't skip over, he had to be off 3 weeks so we was struggling a bit.  I could cover his side but it meant I had to dig into the wedding fund which I have mostly saved for. In fact I have paid for most of it, but since his new job he had been giving bits where he could afford too. His work situation changed after his accident as legal issues had occurred which i won't go into detail but meant he needed to get legal advice. But I supported him through this as ita not his fault,  unfortunately he hasn't helped himself and not spoken to solicitor as of yet. He often doesn't do things he's not comfortable or never done before hoping I would hold his hand through the situation.  I have had enough of it and taken a step back as he needs to grow up. \n\n\nSkip forward 4 weeks to Saturday 7th December, i am on his PC as we both are paying a game currently and he let's me play on his PC as he share everything.  I done something I'm not proud of but needed a peace of mine. I went down his google photos to see if he still had those images and make sure he didn't have anymore. Well to my disappointment I find a load of screen shots from a particular nudes model. Now I start to do more digging,  end up finding he has newly set up a fake X account and set an only fans account. His excuse is that we had spoke about doing videos but I made clear I didn't want to risk my job.  Then that was that, but he made a new account at the end of last month 3 months after we discussed and shut the idea down. I then find a private message on Instagram asking to see pictures and for her Snapchat. Again this is not the first time I've seen him ask for other womans Snapchat, knowing I can't see what's been sent. I don't know what's been said or what he's done on Snapchat and dread to think about it tbh. I confronted him about it this morning and all he has done is said sorry. I asked him if he wants to be with me and why . But I'm just getting the same old crap, I've asked for space and I really don't know what to do. I feel so lost right now. Whilst writing this post I picked up the tablet to quote what he said to find he's signed out of Instagram which does says he is still hiding something from me and doesn't want me to find it again. Part of me feels like just messages and pictures as far as he went. But I really don't know anymore he could of slept with someone else, there's plenty of opportunities for him to do some. We work at different times and I do go away overnight now & again for work. I guess I need to think long and hard about what I need to do. But I know whatever it is, it will be my hardest decision ever. I do feel like a total failure and that no man wants to ever marry me. This is my 3rd engagement with someone and each & everytime it's failed. I just feel like its something I've done wrong and the world is telling me I don't deserve to be happy.  After spending too long writing this, I feel like a massive weight as been taken off. My mental health as been really effected the last year and I do feel like I've lost my spark in life. This week has been particularly hard and I have felt like it all would be easier if I wasn't here. I know I shouldn't say that and I really don't want to end it all. But the more time has gone on, the more I start to feel like it's the better outcome. Thanks for spending time out of your day to read this and i apologise for any grammar & spelling mistakes its 1am, I'm tired and head all over the place. I will try and give an update as time goes on. But now it's time for me to simmer over what is the best thing to do. I'm going to take time apart although we live in the same house, I may go over to my mums for a few days. Also to add we don't have any children but a dog which is our fur baby. I'm worried what will happen if we do part and scared he might do something silly as he had made comments about hurting himself before.  ",

      "selftext": "So, this story might be long and have a few updates. Here is what is going on right now.\n\nI am a 14-year-old who lives in a small town in Texas we moved here about 6 years ago and have been living with my stepdad a week after we arrived in Texas it all started one day when in summer when I was having a sleep over at my friend's house so this is what went down, we will call my mom Sara and my stepdad Carlos, you can tell by the names that we are Hispanics, and here is what went down somewhere in August so after i got home the next day of my sleepover i was in the car with Sara talking to her friend saying that she was mad at Carlos because the previous night he had shoved a dirty cleaning towel because she \"hadn't cleaned\" something. Then a few days later she started looking for somewhere to move out to and the day she found somewhere Carlos said that if she leaves, he will take away her phone and her car because he paid for both of them at the time so she stopped and then about a week later she found another place and she told my sister who we will call Natalie to ask Carlos if he could give her a white truck that he had and barely used and was planning to sell it, after that Sara asked my brother who we will call David, if he could give her a small black car that he didn't use anymore because he had recently gotten a motorcycle and he was fine with it after that there were a lot of tear from Sara because Carlos said that she was cheating on him and that her best friend was talking things behind her back with her brother who was also her friend because he worked for Carlos and some other things that she doesn't want to tell me and the same day that she found the other house (house #2) i think Sara told Carlos that she had found a house then since he was drinking that day he was a bit intoxicated and so the time that he got inside into the kitchen i walked in because i heard a bit of yelling and and since he had a can of beer he threw it at Sara's face while she was cooking dinner and it got in her eyes so she started crying and yelling to call the police so she went into my Natalie's room to call the police and so anfter that i got a bit emotional so i called the police and told them that i was scared because of what had just happened and the operator told me that an officer was in my area and was close to my home so when they got here Sara was still mad at Carlos and yelling at him because of what had happened and Carlos said that she was cheating on him and she said that if she really was he wouldn't find out so the police told her to stay away from him to prevent future hostility and so they talked to both Sara and Carlos in private so they took away Carlos to the police station but they had to take them to the hospital because he got really bad so David had to go pick him up and after he picked up Carlos fro the hospital he went into Natalie's room to yell at Sara and so she and Natalie called the police again so they came and to prevent more madness they told David if he could take Carlos to a hotel to stay the night so he left and then Sara and Natalie went to sleep because they wanted to move out the next day which they did and i had to come with them. After all that happened Sara talked to Carlos again and we went back to living with him and after that there were more arguments of why she was cheating on him but i am not ging to be talking about those and so fast forward to 3 weeks ago i had gone to work with Sara and she had gone intp the store to buy something when i looked into her glove compartment and found her makeup bag which was small and thin enough to fit in small spaces then the day later Sara told me to help David find something that was in her van drawers and so while i was looking for it i found some makeup remover liquid so i was like \"that's weird why would she have this in her WORK VAN?\"\n\nSo that is what is happening and why I am a bit weirded out because if we move out again I want to go with her but I also want to stay here with my stepdad who played a big role in my life as a paternal figure. So this is why I turn to you reddit for more reasurement on what decision I have to do in case we move out again.\n\nAlso something I forgot to add was that Sara would hit me on a daily basis but not David she would hit Natalie too but because she wouldn't put up food and I beacuse \"I wouldn't clean\" the house.",

      "selftext": "Okay, I\u2019m 19F and live alone with my Stepdad, who I\u2019ll refer to shorthand as SD, who\u2019s 58M. He\u2019s great most of the time, and has continued to look after me and provide for me after my mothers passing.\n\nI\u2019ve been really sick the last five weeks or so, and I\u2019ve been back and forth the doctors every week trying to figure out what\u2019s going on and trying to get help. \nLast Friday I had an appt at the optometrists to see if they would turn up any results after some issues I\u2019d had with my eyes I thought may or may not be related to the sickness.\n\nSD said he would take me down to the optometrist, go get his hair cut while I was being tested, and then pick me up and drive us home.\nThis has been done before when I have an appt in town, he\u2019ll often go do an errand or get his hair done in a shop in the same town.\n\nBecause of this, I didn\u2019t bring my house keys because I obviously thought we would be returning home together.\n\nCue us heading down to town, he asks if I\u2019ll walk home if I\u2019m done before he\u2019s done in the hairdressers (which confused me, since he\u2019s often very quick in and out.)\nI replied that I didn\u2019t bring my keys and that I\u2019ll just wait in a cafe if he is done before me, no problem.\n\nHe gets irritated and asks why I didn\u2019t bring my keys, then doesn\u2019t let me answer, suggesting that once I finish my test I catch a bus to a hairdressers he\u2019s going do which is about 10-15 minutes away. Which again, confused me. In the past he\u2019s always used the hairdressers in town.\n\nI reply, and I\u2019m positive my tone was normal and neutral and had no attitude, that I would rather not  jump around different places needlessly, especially since I only expected to go to one place today and I\u2019ve been feeling constantly exhausted with this sickness- which he knows.\n\nHe erupts, starts loudly talking about how I\u2019m stressing him out and such a bother and that he\u2019s been constantly trying to work around me lately and that he\u2019s so done with it. He then parks, gives me his house keys, and tells me to walk home when I\u2019m done (home isn\u2019t very far from town, just up a large hill.)\n\n\nIt left me confused and hurt and a bit angry. I thought we\u2019d had a really good week despite my sickness. There had been no arguments, we had gone out to eat takeaway in the car a few nights ago. And I\u2019m positive that I hadn\u2019t spoken in a snappy way. \nI know he\u2019s stressed, I know me being sick has caused him a lot of trouble, and I know I\u2019m a bother to him right now. It just really hurt my feelings.\n\nI get tested, he\u2019s done before I am, he takes us home and acts like nothing happened. He goes away for the weekend on a pre planned trip.\n\nHe came back today, we hang out for a bit, then I ask to talk. I say flat out that I don\u2019t want to argue, I just want to talk about it since it had been really bothering me all weekend.\n\nWhy was he so mean? Why did he erupt at me like that when we\u2019d had a pretty peaceful week and I hadn\u2019t done anything to provoke him? \nHe starts spewing about how it had just all built up and he\u2019d been doing so much for me, that I just need to get better and snap out of it, that he was stressed and needed me to be normal again.\n\nI feel kind of blank in the convo, and I\u2019m surprisingly really calm when I reply.\nI mention that I just want a bit of an apology since it was so out of nowhere, that I understand that he\u2019s stressed but it just hurt my feelings and I just want to know he feels at least a little bad about it. I mention that Everytime I snap because I\u2019ve had an overwhelming week or month or so on, I always, always, without fail apologise him- whether minutes or hours later. I\u2019ll always say \u2018sorry I was just irritated and didn\u2019t mean to be so mean.\u2019 This doesn\u2019t happen much, but I always make sure to say sorry when it does happen.\n\nSo I say, why can\u2019t you just do the same? A quick \u2018sorry I was stressed and just snapped, I didn\u2019t mean to be so harsh\u2019\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get it. He thinks he was right and justified in shouting at me, that everything had built up and it just happened. \nI understand the build up, but isn\u2019t that more reason to apologise? Because it was just a snap of a moment thing when stressed? \n\nHe said he\u2019s \u2019sorry I feel like I need an apology\u2019 and that he\u2019ll \u2019apologise if I really want him to\u2019\n\nBut it makes me realise he doesn\u2019t want to or see why he should apologise, and that hurts because it means he really, really feels like I deserved to be yelled at like that.\n\nI\u2019m just really upset and confused.\nAm I overthinking this? Was I the asshole? I think I just need someone else\u2019s perspective.\n\nSorry this is so long.",

      "selftext": "Just a heads up I used ai to help me write this if it\u2019s seems abit robotic. \n\nA couple of months ago, I sold a high-end hair straightener to a friend for \u20ac100. I originally bought it for \u20ac200 about a year ago, and it had only been used 15 times or less, so it was in great condition. She asked if she could pay in installments, and I agreed, telling her she could take her time. Over the next month, she only paid me \u20ac25 of the agreed amount, but I didn\u2019t pressure her because I trusted her to follow through eventually.\n\nRecently, she messaged me saying her mom had bought her another hair straightener, so now she wanted to return the one she bought from me and get a refund. I was really taken aback because it had been over a month since she bought it, and I felt like the sale was final. I explained to her that this wasn\u2019t a loan; it was a sale, and it didn\u2019t make sense for her to return it after using it.\n\nHer response was defensive and dismissive. She told me the straightener was in the exact same condition as when I sold it to her, implying that my concerns about the condition were unfair or unwarranted. She also brushed off my feelings by saying it shouldn\u2019t matter if she used it since I could still sell it for the same price. I tried to clarify that my comment about the condition wasn\u2019t meant to accuse her specifically of damaging it\u2014just that once something leaves my care, I can\u2019t know for sure how it\u2019s been handled, and that\u2019s a general concern I\u2019d have with anyone.\n\nI also pointed out that this issue ultimately stems from her mom buying her another straightener, which is outside of our agreement and not my responsibility to fix. I suggested alternative solutions: her mom could sell the new straightener, or she could sell mine and use the money to pay me back. I even said I\u2019d be willing to take the straightener back and refund her the \u20ac25 she already paid, even though I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nWhat upset me the most was how dismissive she was about my perspective. She didn\u2019t acknowledge the inconvenience this caused me and instead seemed focused on making this my problem to resolve. I was especially surprised at how quickly she mentioned the \u20ac25 I could \u201ckeep\u201d as compensation, given that I had told her there was no rush to pay me the full amount.\n\nAITA?",

Because it doesn\u2019t feel this way for me and idk if IATAH.\nMe (24F) and my BF (32 M) lived together for a 1y, but we had many arguments and I decided to break up with him and move out. After a month we reconsidered the relationship, started couples therapy and things kinda are better now. But we didnt move back in. It\u2019s been 2 months since then. I do stay over his apartment about 2-3 days a week and commute to work. But recently it feels like a burdain to go over his place. \n\nWhen we lived together it was rough for me because I had to commute daily to the office for 2h. He lives 1 min away from his workplace. Besides having to commute there are multiple other disadvantages: I am far away from parents and my old and sick grandma which I love deeply and really care about. All my friends are in my hometown. I get my much needed alone time which I dont really have access to when living together cause there is always sth i have to do (shopping, cook, clean, run errands, go to the gym with him - thats goes to the \u201chave to\u201d pile cause i hate the gym but he is a gym freak that wants his gf working out to build a ass haha). When I live alone I can stay up as much as I want to or get up as early as I want to whereas when we live together it always has to be at the same time - usually the time he decides. I miss him more and overall my feelings towards him are positive when away because he is quite clingy and suffocating. I can dress as I please when going to work, when we lived together if I was too dressy he would make comments about it until I would feel bad and change just to avoid a argument. Same with makeup. Also the home conditions at my place overall are better because we lived together in a rented apartment that he doesn't want us to move out of. I have time to read, watch my TV shows or just lay in bed when I want without announcing before that I wont be spending some time with him. \n\nThere are more but these are the ones that are most important for me atm. Our therapist suggested we set a date/period for the time we\u2019ll move back together to ensure stability and security in the relationship. He asked me a few times when I think I will be ready to move back in. I never had a response and I am starting to feel like a impostor to this relationship. I just don\u2019t want to move back in. And I don\u2019t know how to adress the reasons behind it because this will sound stupid. I feel like I sound childish and stupid. Some opinions might help me.. How do I say this to him and the therapist?\n\nAITAH for not wanting to live together with my SO? \n\n",

      "selftext": "I (20f) went on a trip with my mother and brother over thanksgiving. My mother has been emotionally and verbally abusive and manipulative for as long as I can remember in my upbringing. If I gave examples of everything she\u2019s done we\u2019d be here all day. I worked hard throughout high school to save enough money to move out as soon as I turned 18 and most of my problems were solved thereafter. Whenever I\u2019m around her she still tries to tell me what to do despite me being an adult. The trip I was on with my family prior to this incident she yelled at me \u201cyou will obey me because I\u2019m the parent and you\u2019re the child\u201d. Keep in mind I\u2019m 20 years old with my own house and job. I\u2019ve always considered cutting contact but we live in the same town and I love my dad who\u2019s married to her so I\u2019ve put up with her for the sake of not wanting more drama. However, this past thanksgiving I was invited on a trip with my parents and older brother (26yom). I originally said no but I had off of work and it was hard to come up with an excuse so I went after some convincing from my parents. This trip was the absolute worst. My brother lost his temper and cursed me out on many different occasions. My brother has always been an aggressive and violent person and growing up I was always scared of making him snap. To make a long story short, he locked himself out at some point during the trip and proceeded to put the blame on me for speaking and told me to \u201cshut the f up\u201d. He used this exact quote probably 4 more times over the course of 3 days in complete seriousness not in some joking manner. My mother on this same trip posted a picture of me online without asking me and without my knowledge that she even took the picture. I told her that I don\u2019t even have my own social media and I prefer I don\u2019t be posted but she ignored me. About 2 minutes later I said seriously can you delete it. She screamed, yes legit screamed, at me to \u201cshut up\u201d. This was in a public hotel setting and made things quite uncomfortable. The next day we were out at dinner and when everyone was talking she yet again raised her voice and told me specifically to \u201cshut it\u201d telling me to stop talking. She never treats my brother like this but I think part of that is because she\u2019s also scared of how he\u2019ll snap. I had no choice but to push through the rest of the trip and ignore them as best I could. As soon as I got home I blocked both my brother and mother. Well, my mother apparently tried calling me 8 times last night before realizing it wasn\u2019t going through and called me from a different number. Today she showed up at my house when my boyfriend was outside, when he told her I wasn\u2019t coming outside she said \u201ctell her to have a nice life then\u201d and sped off. She then proceeded to email me the following message: \u201cWhat you are doing is very hurtful and harmful. Ghosting wo cause is unjust I cannot help or fix anything if I don't know what is wrong\u201d. Life has been so much more peaceful since I haven\u2019t had to deal with her but everyone else in my life seems to think that cutting her off isn\u2019t fair and to be honest I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019d respond to that message.  My mental health has been so much better without her in my life but maybe I\u2019m not seeing the full picture? I\u2019m already stressing about if I should go to her house for Christmas for my dad\u2019s sake or if it\u2019s just not worth the fight that\u2019s sure to happen. ",

      "selftext": "AITA for responding the way I did after my former best friend ended our friendship?\n\nHi, Reddit. This is a messy situation, but here goes. My (22F) former best friend, \u201cclaire\u201d (22F), and I had been close for years. She was someone I genuinely cared about, but things between us started to fall apart after a series of misunderstandings and emotional conflicts.\n\nA few months ago, Claire\u2019s mom tragically passed away after battling cancer. I was in Texas during that time because i had some family things i had to take care of, and had no car or transportation because i was living in idaho at the time for college , and while I wasn\u2019t able to make it to the funeral, I was close enough to potentially be there for her. She asked if I could attend her mom\u2019s funeral, and I said I\u2019d ask my mom about it since I didn\u2019t have control over my transportation at the time. i was only in texas for 5 days and two of those days were flying and the other three were for some plans my family had made MONTHS ahead, and had no way of cancelling them. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work out, as i was told that i could not go. i even argued with my mom and ruined the trip over it bedauwd i desperately tried going there, and I deeply regret not being able to be there for her.\n\nClaire brought this up in a heartfelt message recently, sharing that my lack of support during her mom\u2019s passing left her feeling abandoned. She also said she felt like I prioritized my family, and was \u201cworking so much i never had time for her\u201d even though i was texting and/or calling her multiple times a day and ruining my sleep schedule because this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s accused me of prioritizing my family and life over her and neglected her emotional needs during one of the worst times of her life. any time she would see me with my other friends, i was accused of putting her on the \u201cbackburner\u201d and that i don\u2019t care about her. and when i would mention my other friends in conversation, she would shut down and try to change the subject. mind you i am a full time worker who is in college and trying to pay out of pocket. \n\nWhen I first got her message, I apologized immediately. I told her that I understood where she was coming from and that I was sorry for making her feel invalidated or unsupported. I thought we had reached some kind of resolution because she accepted my apology at the time, and I genuinely believed we were moving forward. But then, days later, she sent another message saying she had decided she couldn\u2019t move past everything and wanted to end our friendship.\n\nIn her final message, Claire expressed that she had been forgiving me for a long time, but she felt I never made meaningful changes. She accused me of being selfish, overly focused on how others perceive me, and not caring enough about her pain. She said she felt she was waiting to use her mom\u2019s passing in case of an argument after the first time we talked. now i am not trying to sway anyone\u2019s opinions because i HATE when people do that, but i do think it\u2019s a little strange she wanted to wait to use that in an argument against me if things did go south. \n\nI responded as honestly as I could, explaining that I had been dealing with a lot of stress and personal challenges at the time. I told her that my lack of presence wasn\u2019t due to a lack of care but logistical and emotional struggles I was going through. i had been having a lot of emotional stress and some very concerning thoughts constantly that i needed to get treatment for, and she was aware of this and had told me many times that it was okay and she was very supportive. i tried to communicate during these times often. I also pointed out that many of these issues hadn\u2019t been communicated to me directly\u2014at least not in the blunt, clear way they were in her final message. I wanted her to know that I genuinely cared about her, but I also wanted to provide context for why I acted the way I did.\n\nClaire didn\u2019t take my response well. She accused me of making excuses and justifying everything to make myself look better. She said I was insensitive and that my response proved I only cared about myself. She also said that me mentioning feeling like I had to walk on eggshells was insulting and untrue because she felt she had gone above and beyond to be patient with me.\n\nSince then, Claire has cut all contact with me. I\u2019ve been left reflecting on the entire situation and wondering if I\u2019m truly as selfish as she says. I feel like I\u2019ve owned up to my mistakes and tried to communicate my side of things, but maybe I could have done more.\nafter this i get a message from one of her friends, m24, and is attacking me for not being there for her all the time. i tried to defend myself, and it is a literal message in the berating comments that i received that all i can do is try to defend myself. multiple times with this friend group i tried to make everyone happy and reached out when i could, but any time i was busy or struggling, i was met with nasty messages from both Claire and David. i talked to my therapist and a couple of people that are trained in this kind of stuff, and they said that i was not the AH and did the right thing in my messages.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for how I handled this situation? Should I have responded differently, or is there no way I could have salvaged this friendship?",

      "selftext": "I've told this story in a few other subreddits, but I'm gonna tell it here.\n\nI had this friend since high school, let's call him Zero. He was one of my greatest friends. He was always there for me when I needed him, and he got along great with my family as well. We had a lot in common. We did everything together; go to each other's houses, to the mall, the movies, restaurants, anything you can think of. I thought of him as an older brother, even though I have a brother who's younger than me already. We'd be here all day with me talking about all the stuff we'd do together, but the best way I can describe it is that he was someone important to me.\n\nHowever, in October 2022 (I was 18), my mom came into my room and told me that Zero told her he has a crush on me. My mom asked me if I ever wanted to date him in the future, and I said no because I just wanted to stay as friends.\n\nFast forward six months-ish later, Zero tells me that he thinks my mom is pushing us to be a couple. I did not believe that for one minute, as I know my mom. Never has she expected me to date a guy, especially since I was barely in college at the time. He then told me he'd rather I not speak about it to my parents. I told him I had to, as I had to find out if this was true. He said, \"I wouldn't recommend it.\". I should also note that Zero had a girlfriend at that time, so I don't know why he said anything like that.\n\nOne day, I went out for a walk with my mom, and told her what Zero told me. She said, \"Seriously? I never said anything like that. He's lying. I would never force a boy on you.\". She then brought up the fact that Zero told her he has a crush on me. Apparently he texted her about it, so with mom's permission, I viewed the text messages. None of them indicated that my mom was forcing us to be a couple. She was just very open about it, saying things like, \"Oh, I don't mind if you date her. But these are the rules you need to follow. Don't be out past 10 PM, tell us where you're going when you're going out, etc.\". Just her being accepting of the fact that Zero had feelings for me, but also setting some ground rules in case we ever did become an item.\n\nFast forward a week, I tell Zero, \"Hey, I told mom about what you said. But could you at least provide me some proof about your claim? Not calling you a liar.\". He then answers, \"So let me get this straight. You ignored my feelings and now you want me to help you? Some friend you are. I'm no tool so I don't enjoy being used. Don't contact me again. Goodbye.\". I didn't want to lose him, so I immediately apologized for telling my mom. He then accepted it, and said, \"But because of what you did, you've put me in a tough position with your parents, so I'm not coming over anymore. We can only be friends virtually.\".\n\nI went with it because part of me thought he was going to eventually change his mind and see me IRL again. I've brought it back up a few times, and again, he's said he can't bring himself to see me. Try as I might, he never budged on seeing me again. I did everything you can think; assuring him there is no tension, my parents have nothing against him, we would love to welcome him again. But no. I even asked my dad to call him and talk to him, but dad told me, unsurprisngly, Zero never answered him. (To clarify, he just didn't want to see my parents, not exactly me)\n\nOne day, I got the courage to tell Zero everything I felt; I was sick of the distance, I just wanted him to understand that there is nothing wrong among us, my parents miss him and would love to see him again. I missed the way things used to be. I wanted what we had back then. He acted like he understood my feelings, but said things like, \"Well, I'm embarrassed. Normal embarrassment I can get over, but this, I can't. It's hard to explain, but it's an abstract concept lalala\". \"You just have to accept that this is something not under any of our control, at least for now\".\n\nI went along for a few more months or so, hoping he would change his mind. He got himself a few more significant others with whom he broke up with, and last year he moved in with another girlfriend (I think they're still dating today but idk). Eventually my breaking point hit. I just couldn't wait any longer. The friendship just wasn't what it used to be anymore.\n\nI sent him message saying that this kind of friendship is no longer sustainable for me, and that it's best we go our separate ways. He accepted, and we ended things with peace. At least it was much calmer than his attempt to cut me off the previous year.\n\nMy parents say that just because Zero didn't want to visit me anymore doesn't mean I had to end things with him. He was still my friend, no matter what the distance was between us. But my other friends tell me that Zero was being stupid. They say he lied about the whole \"mom pushing us to be a couple' thing just so he could make me his girlfriend. However, given the fact that he had a girlfriend himself at the time of claiming it, I don't know. He did end up breaking up with that girlfriend because she was controlling or something, but he did say at one point he gave up on the crush on me. And he got defensive when I asked him for proof on his claim, which wasn't like him at all. I don't think he wanted me to be his girlfriend, but at the same time, I really don't know why he brought it up in the first place. So I don't know. AITA?\n",

Also stating that the lunch room they had lunch in that is known for being the spot where everyone eats was completely empty that day.\n\n- didn\u2019t disclose how 2 of his closest friends in town are girls he used to have feelings for, 1 of which he asked out years ago AFTER I asked him the first time if he had any friends in his current life he used to have feelings for, but keeps around. I don\u2019t care if someone I\u2019m with has friends of the opposite gender, but if they are friends that had romantic attraction (even if it wasn\u2019t reciprocated), then that makes me uncomfortable.

      "selftext": "I (30F) have been friends with a guy (33M) for about a year. We became very close and he started to confide in me a lot, but we have exactly zero romantic or sexual interest in one another. Two months ago he got a new girlfriend. I've never met her, but she's extremely jealous of everyone and everything - so obviously, his having a close female friend is seen as a threat by her, even though 95% of our communication happens via text. Today, I fell down on my skates and my ankle was pretty swollen, so I sent him a picture telling him what happened. It was as far away from a sexual picture as it could be (just my ankle with the hematoma and swelling), but she still made several comments about it, which he told me about. Apparently, she gave him grief over it and claimed I was trying to entice him with that picture of my fucked up ankle. Tbh, I'm too old to deal with this shit. I have no interest in having someone spread negativity towards me and about me because of her insecurities. I don't even know why she's so insecure (she's a fairly attractive woman and, from what I know about him, he's strongly against cheating in general, as he's been cheated on before). I don't accept overbearing jealousy in my own relationships and certainly don't want to be forced to take it from her. I also don't want to keep \"policing\" my messages to him because god forbid I say the wrong word and it makes her freak out about me again - maybe she has issues with my sending a picture of my dog or whatever (?). If she was a reasonable person, I'd hand her my unlocked phone so she could see I've never sent anything remotely flirty to him, but I know she'll have issues with anything, if she thinks a bruised ankle is \"enticing\". So I'm thinking about telling him I'll take a step back from the friendship to avoid harming his relationship and also to, quite honestly, just avoid the stress of dealing with her negativity. AITAH? I do genuinely care about him, he's been a good friend otherwise, but her attitude made me upset all day and I don't see it getting any better.",

I used to do similar work so I guess I understand the hustle.\n\n\nAnyway recently he found out that I was visiting Sydney to see my boyfriend who is dog sitting at his parents house, Sydney is around a 14-16 hour drive from where I live and he asked if he could come along, I said sure as I wouldn\u2019t mind having someone to share the drive with as it\u2019s quite gruelling. \n\n\nThis was all fine until last week when he told me out of the blue he needed to use my car for 4 days to then travel down to Wollongong which is 3 hours south of Sydney, I didn\u2019t want him to use my car and I said no you can take the train. He wanted to use it so he could take his film gear to shoot and video and bring back a surfboard he had brought.\nWell I guess this is where the trouble begins, I asked him if maybe he would do some extra work for me for free, 4-5 hours of work, priming canvases in exchange for using the car. He said sure and came over and did about 3 canvases. Maybe half an hour of work.\n\n\nThe next day he calls me up kinda randomly and says it\u2019s fucked how much work I\u2019m getting him to do for free and that actually I should be paying him to prime these canvases as well as stretch them because it\u2019s very difficult work.\nI then later found out from a friend that he (maybe hyperbolically) said I was making him do slave labor.\n\n\nI just found this all so frustrating and immature. Not only is he getting a free trip to Sydney, he\u2019s also using my car and getting a few night of free accomodation in my boyfriend\u2019s parents house. He then sent me a weirdly cryptic message along the lines of \u2018 don\u2019t sell the lifestyle without the terms and conditions.\u2019 And has has commented on my instagram posts about \u2018paying for your art assistant\u2019.\n\n\nI am seriously considering just paying him for the work he has done and going to Sydney alone. He would then lose money on the flight back that he has already paid for.\nAm I the asshole for asking him to do this work in exchange for the Sydney trip and car?\n\n",

I've been ordering bottles for a while but since the war in Ukraine started It's been almost impossible to get a bottle here in the states. I was only able to get a small bottle recently from a guy who lives in Belarus. I admittedly payed way too much for it but i love the stuff and sometimes you just have to pay extra for what you like. I had it in the fridge and was going to enjoy it with dinner after work. When I got home I made a bowl of instant noodles and opened the fridge to grab my bottle of liquid heaven. It wasn't there. I figured maybe it got moved so I asked my girlfriend and she said she gave it to her little brother because he wanted something to drink and she couldn't find anything else. I was pretty angry so I just ate my ramen in silence and went to bed. Now my girlfriend is saying I'm being childish throwing a fit over a bottle of soda. So... am I the asshole?",

      "selftext": "All of the names have been changed and ages will be changed although close to actual ages. \n\nSo I (14 female) take drama at school. We\u2019ve recently decided to put on a parody of The Wizard of Oz. It\u2019s basically about a group of students attempting to put on The Wizard of Oz, but everything starts going wrong. I think the play is pretty funny actually and will be fun to put on, maybe scary though because it\u2019ll be my first time performing in front of an actual audience that\u2019s not my classmates. Along with performing The Wizard of Oz parody, we\u2019re also doing Anne Frank, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s relevant to the story. Anyways, our drama teacher gave us a sheet to fill out on what characters we would not want to be under any circumstances and our top three choices on what we wanted to be. For TWO (I\u2019m shortening The Wizard of Oz to this), I put that I wanted to be 3 more minor roles in the play as I have some stage fright and don\u2019t want to have a major role. I put that I didn\u2019t want to be Dorothy, Wicked Witch, and so on. When our drama teacher announced what roles we got one by one by writing on a whiteboard, I\u2019d gotten Scarecrow. For context, Scarecrow is a pretty major role in the play with it being kind of a deuteragonist role. The Scarecrow in the play is basically a boy who thinks all plays are musicals and didn\u2019t know that a play could not be a musical, so he studied the script for the musical version of TWO. The boy just randomly bursts into song as Scarecrow a bunch and is pretty funny. I did not want this role though because it is a more major role and I had chosen smaller roles for the ones I wanted to play on the sheet. I did not explicitly put that I didn\u2019t want to be Scarecrow on the audition sheet though so I was relatively fine with it although I was a little disappointed and I probably looked like it too. \n\nAfter my role was revealed, the girl next to me, let\u2019s call her Pamela, was staring at me quite a bit. I was a little put off by that, but mostly ignored it. I\u2019d didn\u2019t realize at the time why she was staring at me. Now, there\u2019s going to be a time skip to a day later, on Saturday. I had a birthday party that day that I was going to attend and at the birthday parties, a friend of mine who was close to Pamela told me something. She said that Pamela hated our drama teacher and apparently me now. Basically, Pamela had emailed the drama teacher after we had already filled out our audition sheets and said that she didn\u2019t want to be a certain character. I don\u2019t know if she put that character as one of the characters in the play she wanted to be or maybe she forgot to put that role as a character she really didn\u2019t want to be though. Anyways, she emailed the drama teacher and the drama teacher still cast her as that specific role, this might be because he head already decided the roles and didn\u2019t want to change them or he didn\u2019t see her email, I honestly don\u2019t know. My friend (well we\u2019ve been having issues and I honestly don\u2019t know if I want to be friends with her anymore) then said that Pamela hates me too because I looked disappointed and apparently let out an, \u201cAw,\u201d at getting a major role (I don\u2019t know if I did this, but maybe I did?). The friend(?) said that Pamela was angry at this and felt I was being ungrateful and said I hadn\u2019t even auditioned for Scarecrow and I got it. I actually did audition for Scarecrow and the drama teacher said he\u2019d cast me because of how I was the only one who actually sang for the audition and that it was funny.\n\n I asked if Pamela actually hated me and wasn\u2019t just angry at me and my friend(?) said that Pamela hated me. Another friend at the table said to ignore Pamela and that she was kinda erratic and she really didn\u2019t like Pamela. I\u2019m kinda worried though. I feel like my friend(?), let\u2019s call her Amy, who told me about what Pamela said kinda agreed with Pamela about how I was being ungrateful for being disappointed at getting that role because of the way she told me about what Pamela said. I don\u2019t know if I want to be friends with this friend anymore, but for some reason her opinion still matters to me since I\u2019ve been friends with her for a very long time, much longer than I\u2019ve known my other friends for. I\u2019m just worried that I\u2019m actually wrong and this situation and that even if I\u2019m not wrong, it\u2019ll be very awkward in drama class between me and Pamela and maybe she\u2019ll target me.\n\n Also, before you ask why I\u2019m even friends with Amy, Amy\u2019s kinda popular in school and she also always talks about me to her friends from what I\u2019ve observed. I used to be a huge over-sharer when I was younger too, so Amy knows basically all my secrets even though I don\u2019t think I know all of hers. I might make a separate post on this to ask for advice because I know I\u2019m doing bad things in that toxic friendship too. I know this is a pretty childish thing to post about and I really shouldn\u2019t even be on Reddit at my age and might get bashed for being on Reddit and writing this, but I\u2019m just really worried about this. Also, sorry for writing so much. Hopefully no one I know will find this because the play and role I got is the same.\n\nTLDR: I got a major role I didn\u2019t want in a play because I have some stage fright and wanted a small role. Now a girl hates me because I was acting ungrateful by looking disappointed. My friend(?) who\u2019s gotten really close to her lately probably also agrees with her so that\u2019s another reason I posted here. ",

I sat down and waited.\n\nThing is, she finished with that client and then brought *another* person to her chair, completely ignoring me.

That means she already double-booked and was just gonna do whichever one of us first, but if I took the time out to schedule the appointment, do I not get first dibs?

      "selftext": "I (30F) am currently engaged and getting married next spring. My father has spent a majority of my life being an alcoholic and my mother chose to ignore the problem until recently. If I\u2019m being completely truthful, having a parent with an addiction was challenging. It\u2019s hard to not be resentful to both my dad and my mom. I also have a sister (27F). She was impacted heavily by my dad\u2019s drinking. One of her weird behaviors coming from her childhood is needing to be the center of everything. I have many situations where she meddled way too much or got involved where she shouldn\u2019t have. Since we were teenagers, she would get herself involved with my romantic relationships, my friends, and even when I bought my first home. While I still have a relationship with my family, I do keep my distance both mentally and physically. With that being said, I ended up moving halfway across the country which does bother my family at times.\n\nRecently, my dad ended up in a hospital for a major complication with his alcohol addiction. My mom basically gave him an ultimatum and told him he needed to get sober, which he agreed. I stayed in contact with my family and asked my mom repeatedly if I needed to get on a plane and be there. She told me that it wasn\u2019t necessary, and that I needed to focus on work. My sister, who lived a few hours away, did come and help after my dad got discharged.\n\nMy sister and I both have weddings scheduled for next year, and we have extended relatives on my dad\u2019s side that are coming. I\u2019ve been trying to find a good time to tell my dad about their attendance (he is estranged from them). I talked to my mom and we both agreed to give it a few months to allow my dad to focus on his sobriety and then talk to him about it.\n\nI received a text message from my sister today informing me that she told my dad about his relatives being at my wedding. I panicked and told her that I had a plan for disclosing this myself and questioned why she felt the need to do that. She explained that our dad asked her if his relatives were attending her wedding and that she decided to \u201crip the bandaid off\u201d and tell him about my wedding too. I was livid. I got ahold of my mom and asked what happened. I reminded her of the timeline that I had to discuss this with my dad and my mom  claimed she forgotten. After some back and forth, my mom blamed me and stated that if I had come home to be there for my father, that my sister wouldn\u2019t have been in the position to talk about my wedding. Things really escalated, and my current position is that my mom and my sister are no longer invited to the wedding. This is something that I have paid for myself, and this was a personal detail that was not my sister\u2019s to share. My fianc\u00e9e thinks I am overreacting and that I should apologize to them. I think they both overstepped, and will not understand boundaries unless I set them myself. AITA? ",

      "selftext": "The following is a long ranting post so I apologize in advance for the length and it being all over the place. I'm typing on my phone so it's too difficult to edit my long stream of consciousness rant.\n\n\n\nMy dad (77m) and I (38f) rarely see each other and this was never an issue until I had kids (4 & 11months).\n\nMy dad is not a bad guy, but he's selfish and doesn't often think about how his actions and words affect others. I lived with him when I was a teenager and our relationship was really problematic with him yelling at me every day, from morning until night (literally starting the day waking me up by yelling at me to turn off my alarm). Yet he had post-it notes around the house that said \"joy\" as a reminder to experience joy in life. Yet somehow not towards me...\n\nMy dad never bonded with his parents and then never bonded with his 3 kids. We're all pretty fine with it; we don't know any other way. Our mom makes up for it since she's 100% maternal, so we are healthy when it comes to relationships and am incredibly bonded to my kids.\n\nI have lived in a different city from my dad since I was 18 and I would go back home throughout the year but as time passed I would sometimes just go back for Christmas, so maybe once a year I would see him. And this is our norm. I'm not feeling the need or want to see more of my dad. I thought that when I had kids that things would change, but they didn't and later I accepted that.\n\nBut right now I am fuming. My dad has a habit of offering things - big things - and then taking them away. For example: when our first kid was about 7 months old, he offered to loan us a down payment to buy a house. We got a broker, an agent, looked at listings, and just before our first viewing, a stock of his dropped and he took back the offer. \n\nMore recently, my step mom (his wife) called me and told me they would be setting up education accounts for our kids. I was so thankful! We had been planning on starting those accounts in the new year when my maternity leave was done, but this is so generous. I called him to thank him and he said they were just thinking about it. Okay....? (He also offered to pay for my sister's university, never did. Offered my.mom back pay for child support - nope.)\n\nAnd then a couple weeks ago they said they would be calling me the next day to talk about a time to visit us. We're an hour flight away (they get free standby flights) so that sounded great to us. We last saw them in the summer and they mentioned a few times they were planning to come visit us. We don't travel, my husband works weekends, so we're always around, and I told them this, so anytime is probably good, just need a big of warning in case we have local plans. It never happened until now, the last month of the year. They didnt call when they said they would, but a day or two later we texted and I said during the week would probably be best. My step-mom said they could come the 10th to 13th and I said great, and put it in my calendar. Then I spoke to my dad who said they may not be able to make it then because they were planning on flying standby to their winter home and the later they fly out, the busier it would be Okay...I'm not the one who picked the dates for them to visit, they did. I told him I hoped he could make it because by the time they got back in the spring, the baby would be so much older.\n\nThen I speak to my dad again and he says they actually aren't leaving for the winter but they aren't going to come visit because it's such a \"schlep\". Ouch. But they will be around for the holidays so I could visit them at their place!\n\nNow, this is where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. My sister in law has a family with 2 kids. I've been with my husband for 13 years and we spend every Christmas at my SIL's place. Now that we have kids too, it's even better because the cousins are so close and it has created a great dynamic. We go on vacation together with the 2 families and everything. Now, my husband's family is different than mine (with exception to my mom who I'm very close with). Me, my husband, and his sister are in a group chat and we talk nearly every day. My husband talks to his dad almost every day as well. His dad will even call me for tech support if my husband is working, so I speak to him fairly often as well. (My dad calls less than once a month, often going several months without us speaking.) Because of this constant communication, plans get made. After we see each other in person we are always asking when we'll see each other next and eventually plans get finalized and we make the effort to see each other again. Our place is small, but my SIL has a proper house so there's room for us to visit, so even though we have younger kids, we take the 6 hour drive (8 with stops) out to see them about twice a year. My dad lives an hour and a half from them (less time with no traffic, but there's never no traffic) but he lives in the opposite direction from us. So it would add an extra 1.5 hours to our already very long drive with 2 young kids. Plus we never stay long, 3 or 4 nights, so I'm not exactly eager to put the kids back in the car for 3 hours between 2 really long car rides. When we visited my SIL this summer, as a way to see by dad and siblings, we had a beach day with my family who then all came back to SIL's house and this was when they all met the baby for the first time. (My dad and mother in law were almost 2 hours late - something to do with the car.) To add to this, they were anti-vax during covid and we had a new baby so that created some distance and tension. I did fly out on my own with my first kid for a long weekend for my dads birthday. I came back completely exhausted because their house was a death trap for a toddler so I had to be on top of her the entire time. They even suggested a walk down by the water one night which would have been lovely except there were no railings along the water! With a 2 year old! I had to hold her in my arms the entire time.\n\nBack to the present. My sister is joining us as my SIL's on Christmas Eve so when my dad said he would be in town for the holidays, I invited them to SIL's house the same day. The conversation went like this:\n\nDad: We don't like to drive in the dark\nMe: OK, you can come for lunch and leave early\nDad: Maybe we could go for lunch at a restaurant instead \nMe: That's not the easiest thing with 2 young kids, but maybe we can find something close to SIL's place\nDad: Yeah, we'll see, I'll have to talk to MIL about it\nMe: What would YOU like to do?\nDad: *suddenly enthusiastic* well, you could come to our place the day you leave SIL's and spend the night then drive back home from here the next day!\nMe: Well, that's adding 1.5 hours to an already 8 hour drive, and extending our trip and husband needs to work when we get back so... no. That's not going to work for us.\n\nTurns out this might all be for nothing because when I asked my sister what plans she thought we should make, she told me they changed their mind and were in fact leaving for the holidays! I texted them and it's true, they changed their mind again and now the plan is to leave on the 15th (note it is after the plans they cancelled to come visit us because they might not want to leave so late).\n\nAITA? Should I be making plans to bring my kids to them since they're old even though they literally put no effort into coming to see us and hurting my feelings by offering generous things then taking them away?",

      "selftext": "When I (43M now) was 20 I met a girl (18 at the time) while working at a sandwich shop. We eventually hit it off and dated for a total of 10ish months. She was a rodeo girl and was beautiful, smart, and motivated and had a good bit of direction on her life and I fell for her pretty hard. I had no real direction at the time and I remember her taking me to check out a technical college or something, Then she tried to get me to take classes at community college. \n\nI ended up screwing things up and she stopped talking to me. Among just being an idiot when my shitty car would pass DEQ she registered it in her name to bypass DEQ. Well It was a stupid idea and probably my idea. A ball joint failed on a pizza delivery and it got towed... in her name. I couldn't get up the money to get the car out and she got the bill. Her and her parents got pissed at me. At the time I think she was cooling off on the idea of me anyways.\n\nIt was certainly entirely my fault and I knew it, afterward when I realized she wasn't taking my calls and I was persona non grata, I decided that anything I did to try and get her to talk to me again would make things worse and I worked on letting go. I decided to get my life together if I wanted her or someone like her in my life again. From this a life's work erupts. I get my GED soon after spend most of my 20'2 in and out of community college getting my associates. I was supporting myself and on my own since 16ish that's why it sook so long to finish my associates degree.\n\nI never got to thank her for being the good influence or the reason I got my life together. for the longest time, somewhere she was always the motivation pushing me to be better and be something.  Eventually I met my wife and we we had a healthy baby boy 2 years ago. So rodeo girl is now the third best thing to happen to me. Things at home are good btw.\n\nWhy the issue has come up now.\n\nA few weeks ago I was talking to a friend about how they tore down the old pizza hut I worked at. He loves to prompt me about a story concerning the rodeo girl showing up at the pizza hut. So that brought her up from no where. Then the union contract with tuition reimbursement came into effect and I'm looking to get my EE bachelors. I've been asked why I want to go for it, I have a good stable union career. After examining my motivations she comes to mind. Finally third, a few days ago I was cleaning out my office and looked at a photo album and a picture of her 19th birthday dropped onto the floor. I'm not kidding. \n\nNormally when the topic comes up I can just take the memories of her and put them back in a box and back on the shelf it goes. This time it's bothering me. \n\nI looked her up on Facebook and she's there. Just a beautiful as I remember..  married and hopefully happy. AITAH if I reach out and say hi or thank you for being the catalyst for me getting my shit together and being a better person, I'm not trying to date the woman but of all the people who have come and gone from my life, She is the one I wish I had managed to keep in my life as a friend.",

      "selftext": "Before I start, I have to say  that this is quite a long story so brace yourselves lol\n\nSo I (19F) have a very close friend, let\u2019s call her Nora (19F) who recently started dating a guy, let\u2019s call him Jack (19M) that she met at her school. Nora and Jack have been going steady for a couple of months now. When they first started getting to know each other my friend asked for my help to meet up with Jack and even invited me to come. I at first didn\u2019t want to go because I thought it was a date but she told me it was just a hang out between friends and that she wanted me to meet this guy and see how I felt about him. My friend has quite strict parents so I decided to help her plan it in a way where her parents thought it was just me and her studying. At first he seemed like an ok guy and I had no complaints about him or his personality. But then things started going downhill. We went to a store because he said he needed some things for the activity we would be doing and upon arriving he was quite rude to the employees and made Nora pay for the things he needed. I was in shock but honestly I didn\u2019t know if there was anything I could do about it. Once we arrived to the place he started acting different and was lowly being rude to me and making me carry lots of things up a hill even tho I told him I had a bad knee due to a past knee injury and an injury on my hand. My friend tried to help me out but he seemed to think it was all fun and games. During this walk he kept trying to pressure my friend to say the N word even after she said no because that wasn\u2019t right (we are Mexican) and I am not 100% sure but I thought I heard him say a slur usually directed towards Latino ppl (B***er) but I thought I may have heard wrong so I kinda just moved on but it was always in the back of my mind. During the time I spent with him I just knew he was kinda off and I just sort of tried to stay to the side and let Jack  interact with Nora. He kept on saying weird things like \u201cI could commit crazy crimes on you guys and nobody would know or find you guys because we\u2019re in such a secluded area\u201d and immediately I had a weird feeling about this guy. I ended up leaving early because we could t take it any much longer. Since Nora\u2019s mother thought she was with me after a while I told Nora to head home at a reasonable time so that she wouldn\u2019t get caught by her parents and she told me she would and she would swing back by my place to get some things she left behind and she sent me Jacks phone number saying that her phone battery was low and if I need to reach her that I should text jacks number. It was starting to get late and Nora\u2019s mother started texting me asking to speak to Nora and asking if I could tell her it was time to head back home. I didn\u2019t text back because obviously I wasn\u2019t with Nora. I texted Jack what Nora\u2019s mother has said and at first he ignored me. After about 2 more texts Nora called me from jacks phone and said she would head back soon to grab her stuff and go home. More time passes and it gets late and I\u2019m still waiting but eventually she grabs her stuff and head home but it\u2019s late so I\u2019m worried she might get caught but she didn\u2019t. The next day she called me and asked what I thought and I am honest with her and say I didn\u2019t really get a first good impression of him. She agrees that it was not good and even thinks about ghosting him but didn\u2019t. This is where things get bad. She begins lying more to her parents to go hang out with Jack and it got to a point where she wouldn\u2019t tell us that she told her parents she was with us but was actually with Jack and we would be confused when her mother would call or text us asking where she was at and we had no idea where she was at. She also starts lying to me and our other friends (we have a very tight knit friend group that consists of 3 other girls, 1 guy, and me) about when she would hang out with him, what would happen when she was with him, and even their relationship status. They started dating and she told all of our friends except me and one other girl, she lied to us and said they were still just talking and I had to find out through one of our other friends when they said something about it and they didn\u2019t know that I didn\u2019t know. We all eventually compared all the different things we were told and found out all the lies she had told us and the different versions that everyone was told about what was going on. I did being it up to her and so had my other friends but we honestly just let it slide because we figured since this was her first relationship and first everything she was still figuring things out. We agreed to not tell anymore lies regarding her relationship and that if she just didn\u2019t feel like telling us that was ok but there was no need to lie. We also agreed that she wouldn\u2019t lie to her parents about who she was with anymore because we didn\u2019t want to be part of the lies anymore. \n\nFast forward to about a couple of months ago she\u2019s still lying about many things to the point where me and my friends are starting to lose trust in her. Her relationship with her parents is deteriorating due to her lies and the fact that they do not approve of her boyfriend for reasons that I personally do not agree with. \nOne day, I receive an Instagram DM from Nora\u2019s account that said \u201cFuck you\u201d. I was confused and thought maybe she was just playing around so I clicked on the chat and it had been deleted I sent a message back saying \u201cI saw that lol\u201d and she said \u201coh that was my bf that said that\u201d and I was confused on why he thought it was ok to say that to me since he knows I don\u2019t particularly like him so I matched his energy and said \u201cBitch fuck you too\u201d and went on about my day being mad at the fact that he had the audacity to speak to me like that. That day u called Emily but she was busy hanging out with him so all k told her was to have fun and make sure that he got my message cuz I wasn\u2019t playing around. We didn\u2019t speak again until about 2 days later when he called me \n\n\nTo paraphrase the call she basically said \u201cI didn\u2019t like how you disrespect my man, he was just trying to play around and you should t have said anything. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re mad at him for how he spoke to you I\u2019m mad because you hurt his feelings\u201d. I was in shock and I hung up in her face because honestly I could not believe she had just said that to me. She completely ignored my feelings and tried to make me look like the bad guy. She then texted me asking if I was ok and I said no and told her that I would need some time and distance because all of this was outrageous to me. Since then we did try to talk things out and I tried to explain to her that everything that she and Jack have been doing lately is not ok and I wasn\u2019t no part of it but she just doesn\u2019t understand and simply just wants to flip things on me. I have told her that I am upset that we are having a disagreement over some dumb guy and I really did treasure our friendship quite a lot since we\u2019ve been friends since elementary school but if she didn\u2019t feel the same then that\u2019s on her and that I wasn\u2019t going to sit here and argue with her, once she is open to calmly discuss everything and apologize I would be here. All of my friends agree with everything I said and are disappointed in Nora but I have told them that I don\u2019t want them to pick a side or distance themselves from her because of me since this is between me and Nora and jack only. They have also tried talking to her on their own but they are also worried that everything is going in one ear and directly out the other. I\u2019m still in shock that she is doing all of this from a guy that doesn\u2019t even treat her well (I can go into specifics if people would like me tho about this) and I know that her boyfriend has had some influence in her sudden changes. \n\nIf anyone has any advice on what to do or would like me to go into more detail I would but AITAH?

She is now with me a year after they broke up, but she always brings up things he did for her that I don't do, such as paying for expenses. He would buy practically anything for her, so she says she is used to the idea of a boyfriend paying for everything. It's not that I do not want to buy her things as I normally pay for times we eat out and gifts such as Christmas we set a 150$ limit. However, one thing recently came up where I brought up going skiing, as it is one of my favorite things to do in the winter. She does not have any gear, so she wants me to pay for it. It is about 80$ for rentals and lifts tickets all in all and I don't want to spend that much as I would also have to buy my lift ticket so it would be 120$ in all plus tax. I told her I would rather not as it is very expensive and I don't have enough money, which isn't entirely true. It's not that I am poor; I am pretty well off, but it's just that I prefer to save money where I can. I'm getting a little sidetracked from the main subject, but she thinks I am rich because of my savings, which is a generous amount, but it is called savings for a reason. My savings are my college fund, and I prefer not to take out money unless I need to, so I generally leave it untouched. Thus, I usually don't have a lot of money to spend because I work an on-campus job that does not pay very well, and this is the money I spend. She thinks it's dumb that I save so much and don't offer to pay for her, but I don't see the problem. Sorry I keep getting sidetracked, but I thought I should also mention that she often brings up how unfair our financial lives are as I receive FAFSA, and she does not due to her parents making more. so she holds a grudge against me for this. Anyway, sorry for just kinda spewing, but I don't know what to do. I don't want to spend money I do not have to on her. Am I being a cheapskate, probably? Idk you tell me what you think",

      "selftext": "I (27F) have been recently disowned by my family as retaliation for going NC with my father. It\u2019s a lifetime of stories for background, but to keep it short and neat:\n\n1. My father does not have any relations or connections other than his mother and his wife (my mother). He\u2019s known for being extremely short-tempered and cutting people off for minor inconveniences or miscommunication, which has cut short any form of friendships. His own family is no exception to this rule: He\u2019s NC with all his siblings, only has strained contact with one nephew and at one point was NC with his own mother for about 8 years.\n2. Throughout my life he\u2019s been extremely paranoid about my intentions in every way possible. Walking on eggshells is an understatement. Even as a child, my words have always been taken in the worst possible light and assumed that I\u2019m always belittling or mocking him. I was falsely accused as a 10yo of stealing items from his office and lying about it, and as a young adult of trying to \u201ctrap him\u201d in a bank scheme to, again, steal all his money (I offered my own overseas account for a transaction that otherwise was impossible to make).\u00a0\n3. My father has repeatedly referred to me as a b\\*tch, even going to the extent to ask my then boyfriend during a family lunch \u201cwhat kind of dog food he\u2019s giving me to keep me so tamed\u201d. I was 16 then. All my relationships have been tainted with harsh screaming matches about how I should be ashamed to \u201cbe used as meat so easily\u201d\n4. He\u2019s not and never has been involved in my life other than providing financial stability. My mother has been the one to change my diapers, clean, feed, school, etc. He has not stayed one night up to attend to his sick child, ever. When I was a young child, he repeatedly put me in danger, like leaving me alone as a 2yo in a beach for 2 hours, shoving me in a pool without proper floating gear or forcing me to climb a mountain on a 12 hour hike that ended with me as a 8yo with hypothermia. He\u2019s not involved in the household either. He doesn't even know where the pans are.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was a fight that broke loose after I came home after staying a weekend in my boyfriend's house (we are both doctors and have been together for about 2 years). I was called a wh\\*re and manipulative egocentric narcissist that disregards any form of respect to the household. I decided then and there that I was done with his sexist attitude and swore to myself that I would not speak with this man if he did not change his ways and apologised.\n\nThe rest of my family has sided with him and have been pressuring me to \u201clet water pass under the bridge\u201d and to remember that he\u2019s a good father, regardless of some mistakes in the past. It has come to the extreme that, if I keep \u201cthis attitude\u201d I\u2019ll promptly be disowned. Me and my boyfriend have been uninvited to christmas dinner and new years eve with my family. I feel deeply betrayed by them.\n\nI\u2019m at a crossroads and I\u2019ve been doubting myself a lot. Please, am I being unreasonable or disproportionate here?",

We have know. Each other for like five years and when she peaks with this stuff I usually just step back and mind my own business.\nShe pared up with a guy at her job as friends with benefits. She asked my opinion and I was thumbs up if she was just using him for sex because he is kind of a walking bag of red flags. I should have known better though and she is all in on him as of about two weeks into their just sex deal. \nHe is a genuine mess - 3 kids under 4 with 3 different baby mama\u2019s living with one of them - no car and was working a labor gig at 20 an hour- he has since been put on probation for drug use and no shows and recently fired. He got a car in October and I was jazzed since she drove him to and from work plus shopping and dinner each day.\nI was rude about him early on and told her he was too stupid to fuck - she was rightfully upset as that was her friend if nothing else. She told me that I don\u2019t have a right to opinion on him which is fair I don\u2019t. And after that it was kind of a let\u2019s just not talk about him. We kinda didn\u2019t talk much at all.\nShe called me this week breaking down crazy because they got into a toxic fight- turns out she bought him the car with the idea that he would pay the payments (he hasn\u2019t) she is paying his car insurance and gas money every other day so he can pick up money via DoorDash work. She hasn\u2019t been telling me how bad it is because I am judgmental. \nThe whole mess of it is he is definitely financial abusing her and she still wants him to just be with her and cuddle or some shit. \nHer self esteem is in the literal gutter and I don\u2019t know how to help at all. \nLast night she calls at like 1030 and asks me to go get him from some persons house in our city because he locked himself out of his car door dashing and it is cold. \nI asked her why she just didn\u2019t have him call triple a, she said they are going to use mine for the unlock but asked me to go let him sit in the car with me for warmth. \nI told her I was pretty uncomfortable with that aspect of it and would have to \u201cfix my face\u201d because I don\u2019t like him.  I basically said this is awkward because I don\u2019t like him because he is actively fucking up your life.  I was down to send a car to him or set up triple a. But before I really got into other options she said, \u201cfine I\u2019ll call my cousin and then hung up on me.\u201d\nI get that nice people don\u2019t let someone hang out in the cold but with all the stuff she has shared lately about him and their situation I don\u2019t understand why she thinks I would be down. \nI didn\u2019t call back because I was kinda done with his whole mess and I didn\u2019t feel like saying sorry when I am not.\nI understand that I am not nice but am I an asshole to not help him? \nShould I have done it different? \nI am not even sure why she is that mad but I know she is. \nI feel like just taking a step back from the whole friendship and just not following up because I am freaked out about not understanding the relationship situation. I am 40 she is 31 and he is 29.  I don\u2019t date and am pretty upfront with friendships about communication expectations due to the whole autism thing. ",

Of course i still live with her because i have to and my boyfriend stays most nights to take care of me. \n\nEvery week my grandma will come home and complain about how we do NOTHING. Which isn\u2019t true. We clean her dishes, take the trash out for her, make dinner, carry heavy stuff in for her, we clean the bathroom sometimes and then my room. \n\nMe and my boyfriend practically stay in my room and live in here, we wash our dishes (if we use any) and it\u2019s still a problem. \n\nMy grandma (66) is a hoarder, with food and materialistic items. Hence why me and Boyfriend don\u2019t eat the food because it\u2019s either expired or it\u2019s moldy. The living room piles up with clutter and she piles things on top of each other and then complains she has no room, and that nobody helps her clean. What am i supposed to do? Pile more on top of each other?. \n\nIt doesn\u2019t make it any better because she\u2019s NEVER home, from around 8AM-6/7PM she isn\u2019t home. She\u2019s either with her sister all day or shopping and doing church things. EVERY DAY.  My grandpa sleeps all the time and is very ill, so we help out and sometimes we even make her bed when she\u2019s feeling a little low. (i know it\u2019s not much). \n\nMy boyfriend works most days too, so when he is here he helps. But, he spent the night last night and had work at 2pm, and she took him and then we went shopping for groceries, and then we came home and it was all fine and dandy. Next thing you know, she comes into my room talking about how she shouldn\u2019t have to clean up after us (we left one pan from the air fryer from last night) and then started blaming my boyfriend for not helping and how we do nothing, and how she\u2019s 66 years old and needs help. She then proceeded to say \u201cHe thinks he lives here and he doesn\u2019t i pay all the bills and he\u2019s eating up all our food\u201d so on so forth. (she also uses my wic card and gets 2K from my dads death which is supposed to be my money) \n\nI feel as if she doesn\u2019t like him being around much because when she was young and pregnant her BD wasn\u2019t there for her and it makes her upset. But, when he\u2019s here she asks him to do almost everything. \n\nI told my boyfriend that i think he should only come over a couple times a week and stay home on weekends and see how much she needed him to help. AITA? How is it our fault that there\u2019s clutter and the house is messy if we live in my room and still clean up after her? Should we do more? She expects him to do everything when he works and has school too, she literally does nothing. ",

      "selftext": "So my boyfriend and I live together a few yrs and before we moved in together I was working making 100k salary but i got burnt out and decided to leave my job of 10 years to focus on my mental health. \n\nThat being said, I saved up over 300k within that time frame not including my retirement accounts. Also before I left my job I started an e-commerce business that I\u2019ve been growing (I\u2019ll probably make around 60k this yr from it) \n\nMy boyfriend has always had money trouble and he has little savings due to being unemployed for a while and working on paying debts and other financial goals of his. He makes about 70k right now which is the most he has made. Once he got his promotion and my business started making 5k monthly consistently I decided to leave my job. About 4k if that is profit, plus I make about 1k - 2k monthly investing and doing other random things like bank offers and Instacart. \n\nMy boyfriend works 40hr weeks with random shift times and commutes 30 minutes. Most of the time he is exhausted when he gets home because his job can be physically demanding. \n\nBefore I quit my job we were always 50/50 on chores and I assumed it would stay that way since I\u2019m still contributing financially and I focus on my online shop 2-3 hrs a day. I try to spend a good amount of time outside socializing, exercising, etc. and I\u2019m doing most household errands like shopping and paying bills with our joint accounts etc. \n\nHe is starting to get really upset that I haven\u2019t picked up more chores like cleaning and doing our both of our laundry since he is \u201cthe one with the job\u201d now and I\u2019m unemployed. I tried to correct him and told him I\u2019m working too but just not a traditional job and I\u2019m still bringing in almost as much as he does, if not more. \n\nHe says I\u2019m selfish and that it isn\u2019t about money, it\u2019s about time. Since I have more free time I need to start doing more and so I told him if he wants me to do more than we shouldn\u2019t split bills equally anymore. Maybe 60/40\n\nHe got even more angry that I suggested that because I have more than him financially saved and he has a car payment he pays alone (I drive an old paid off car so no payment). \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being AH here or if it\u2019s fair what I\u2019m saying because I\u2019m still doing an equal financial contribution? Should i be doing more than 50/50 house chores? ",

      "selftext": "I\u2019ve never made a post before but this happened a while ago and has had long term ramifications on my family and I want to know if it\u2019s really me who is the asshole in this situation.\n\nI (40f) and my brother (32m) have not spoken in almost a year because of this situation and our relationship has been strained even longer, mostly because of SIL.  \nAbout 18 months ago my dad had a medical procedure that didn\u2019t go well and he ended up having a stroke and in the ICU for a very long time.  I was his guardian at the time so I was in charge of making his medical and financial decisions.  There were restrictions on how many people could be in the room at the same time so I wasn\u2019t there when my bro and SIL came to visit.  They brought their daughter as well and I found out the next morning, when I checked facebook, that they had made a post asking for thoughts and prayers.  Which to me is cringe and not something I would ever do nor would my dad but what got me upset was when I looked at her pictures and video and saw my dad with tubes etc in his throat in the background.  I was absolutely furious because I thought that was such a huge invasion of his privacy.  My dad is not huge on social media and he does not post pictures of himself or talk about his personal life online.  Like both of my parents, they are lurkers and just like to look at the pics of family and friends and see what is happening in the community.  Not only was it posted by SIL, and brother was tagged, but my SIL\u2019s mom also shared it to her own profile for all her random friends to see!\n\nI immediately called my mom to see if I was justified in my feelings of absolute rage and she also would know him the best since she is his ex and they also had similar online styles.  She agreed and didn\u2019t think he would want that and said she definitely wouldn\u2019t want a picture of her online like that nor would she want everyone to know her business and that she even needed a plea for prayers\u2026\nSo I texted my brother and told him that the post needed to come down and that I didn\u2019t think it was appropriate and that he would not like that.  My brother said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like it\u2019s a big secret he had a stroke.\u201d  Uhh what?  The only people who know, NEED TO KNOW.  Your whole friend group on Facebook and SIL\u2019s moms friend group DOES NOT NEED TO.  Anyway, while he didn\u2019t apparently agree with me, he said he would have it taken down.  \n\nThis is where things got bad.  While texting my brother, my SIL sends the longest text to me to tell me why I\u2019m wrong basically.  This is a common theme in our relationship dynamic.  I text/call/hang out with my brother and SIL makes sure to text or email me and tell me talking points to have with him.  Why she can\u2019t let that man talk for himself is beyond me?  (actually I do know, he apparently \u201ccan\u2019t handle his family.\u201d which is odd since we bend over backwards for them since my mom and I are pushover people pleasers. (working on it yall!))\nAnyway, I\u2019m apparently selfish and a bitch for not letting them share a pic and video of their daughter singing to her papa.  To me this is just attention seeking behavior.  No one needs to know what is going on in his personal life.  If you want to share, feel free to CALL the relevant people who need to know.  Send the video in a text to your mom etc\u2026 But to share a picture of someone in the ICU, incapacitated with tubes all over and unable to give consent just seems like weird ass behavior to me.  I mean,  what are we even talking about here?  But this caused a huge fight and my mom took my kinda took my side in this and ever since then we haven\u2019t spoken.  My SIL blocked me from Facebook ( I can\u2019t even search her name, which i didn\u2019t even know was possible) - she also had her sister, mom and others do the same.  It\u2019s fine because if I wanted to see her page and catch up on my niece, I have many ways to do so though I never do.  It honestly just hurts too much.\n\nSince this happened last year, i missed my niece\u2019s birthday and all the holidays, my brother never even texted me for my birthday.  When my dad passed right before Christmas, he left us a little bit of money.  There wasn\u2019t much left after in-home care costs and getting him set up with a skilled nursing facility\u2026 but we had to meet in person to get this taken care of.  I brought my brother a gift since this meeting landed on his actual birthday.  The whole thing was weird since i hadn\u2019t seen him in so long and especially without SIL.  I really wanted to talk to him and got the guts as we were leaving.  He seemed to be trying to dip the F outta there but I caught up with him and gave him his gift and said I\u2019d really love to talk sometime and that I miss him and my niece.  He said that it is really hard for him because he feels he has to choose between his wife and sister and he has to choose his wife.  I said I get it but it just seems so silly to be fighting about this and it\u2019s not what dad would want and mom hates having to do two separate everythings (holidays, mothers day etc) and its really hard on her.  He didn\u2019t seem to agree and said mom was fine with it (she isn\u2019t and tells me quite often how it makes her physically ill that this has all happened)  I offered to sit down with him and her or just her or all of us or whatever\u2026 I just wanted to talk and get this figured out.  That was 11 months ago.  6 months ago i texted and said i missed him and said maybe we should get a drink sometime.  No answer.  \nMy guess is she wont let him reach out to me because she rules the roost in that house and always has.  Him not even texting me seems pretty odd.  I have a lot of theories about what\u2019s going on but idk\u2026.\n\nSO Am i the asshole for getting upset with my SIL for posting a picture of my dad online after having a stroke and being incapacitated in the ICU?  Even though that decision apparently split the whole family up\u2026?\n\nETA: this wasnt a full on headshot of him or anything but a pic/video (as well as a reel) of their daughter singing to him sitting on his hospital bed. There was a shot or two of him in the background. Since he was \u201cbarely seen\u201d they didn\u2019t think it was a big deal. And i definitely did.\nAs i said in another comment, i was getting texts asking if he was dead or dying after that post and i thought it was just in very poor taste and not what he would have been ok with.",

A little more incentive is that my job gives and $1,000 bonus if you refer someone to our restaurant and they get hired. Yes you read that right, $1,000. I told Rose this and told her right off the bat that if this happened, I would share the bonus with her. I said I\u2019d give her 1/3 of the bonus, so $333. I thought this was more than generous. Well, apparently I was wrong. \n\nRose applied and eventually had her interview, and I asked her how it had went. She told me she had not told my boss that we were friends and that I had referred her to the company. She said she didn\u2019t think I deserve a bonus if I was going to be \u201cselfish\u201d and not give her half. I was so pissed.

My SIL is currently in a relationship with a man who has a history of being a sex offender. While my SIL claims that he's changed and that she's in love with him, I can't shake off my feelings of discomfort and concern.\n\nI expressed my reservations to my husband, who thinks I\u2019m overreacting and believes we should support SIL and give her boyfriend a chance. However, I firmly believe that it\u2019s unsafe for me to be around someone with that kind of history, especially in a festive family setting where alcohol may be involved, and children could potentially be present.\n\nUltimately, I decided that I wouldn't be attending the gathering, and I told my husband he could go if he wanted. He was upset with my decision and feels like I'm causing a rift in the family. He says I'm being judgmental and that it\u2019s not fair to isolate SIL because of her boyfriend's past.\n\nI feel guilty for potentially putting strain on my husband\u2019s relationship with his family, but I also feel it's important to trust my instincts about safety. \n\nUpdate: I never had details of what he did to get on there so I went along with someones suggestion and looked him up on the registry. I had thought of it before but it felt kind of icky with the thought of knowing. The information I will share is he had a couple of sex crimes, both over a decade old and involving sexual assault and groping of adult women. I'm not sure if my husband is aware of this but I feel it's important for me to bring it up to him.",

      "selftext": "Am I the arsehole for not wanting my girlfriend to meet a guy I know she is attracted to\n\nSo, my girlfriend and I have been together for a year and we get along really well, haven\u2019t fought once. I really do love her and I know she loves me as well. We started travelling separately about a month ago and everything was well, but a few days ago we called and talked about how you can sometimes get attracted to people you meet. I\u2019m aware of that, I sometimes get the same feeling, but communication is really important to me, so we talked about it for a while. It\u2019s just been two guys for her, one she found semi attractive, the other one she said was an 8/10 for her, if I wasn\u2019t in the picture. With me in it she says he\u2019s a 4/10 in comparison. She traveled with him and his friend for a bit, but then left them a while later. I think that\u2019s ok, nothing wrong with seeing him for like a week. I asked her to keep her distance from people like that, not ignoring them, but to have some emotional distance. She says she doesn\u2019t want that, because she thinks she\u2019d value the person as a friend as well. I know they had some late night talks and ever since he left they apparently message each other from time to time. I don\u2019t like that. I mean she met the guy for 5 days and now she messages him, she says she felt a real connection to him and I feel that that could lead to emotional cheating. Still I can live with that, as long as it stops one day and stays casual. The thing that makes me angry is that she wants to go visit him. She is in America anyway and he lives about an hour from where she\u2019ll stay, so she said she wanted to go meet him for a few days. I don\u2019t want that, I love her and she hasn\u2019t known that guy for that long, why try to build that relationship. She says that she just wants to keep him as a friend, but I fear that spending prolonged time with him will make it worse. I told her it would make me feel bad if she went to meet him, especially when she hasn\u2019t seen me for 4 months at that point. She says that she feels I don\u2019t trust her and that I\u2019d be stopping her from meeting her friends. Am I in the wrong? I know I get jealous quickly, so maybe I\u2019m overthinking this. She isn\u2019t really familiar with emotional cheating or anything like that, for her cheating just seems to be physical. I feel like shit the last days, my heart is racing, I feel nauseous and I just can\u2019t. Any advice would be greatly appreciated . I know she\u2019d never cheat on me romantically, but emotional cheating is way worse for me. I send her some signs of emotional cheating, like feeling the person gets you in a special way etc. and she says she feels that way with her incredibly close friends as well, but i feel that it\u2019s different, because she likes the guy and she\u2019s only known him for a short time. What am I supposed to do?\n\nTldr:  my girlfriend met a guy whilst travelling she finds very hot. She wants to go visit him. I don\u2019t want her to",

      "selftext": "\nI want to keep this short but will expand on whatever needed. \n\nMy parents are divorced and I am currently my father's full time caretaker since he has dementia. I haven't spoken to my mom in about four years now because she did not have a social security number for me, refused to get me help with it, and blew off helping me with college. \n\nFirst, when I was 18 i tried to file my taxes for the first time, and it returned as already filed. I asked my mom why this would happen and she said literally \"probably because of your social security number, I don't know how we got that or if it's even yours or not\". This lead to a huge quagmire or going to the social security office over and over again trying to figure out if my number was mine or not or if I could even use it. The office decided I was issued the wrong number and gave me a new one. To this day I still have issues with banks pulling info off my credit reports that has nothing to do with me locking me from accounts and this info doesn't show in any credit report I get.\n\nSecond, she refused to get me help. After going to the social security office 12 times and being told something different each time, I told my mom this is not resolving the issue, and asked my mom if we can please talk to a lawyer just to get a list of things I need to do to get this resolved so I can focus on going to college and getting on with my life, as this was starting to interfere with my ability to get loans or files for FASFA. She said it was too expensive and not serious enough. I went to the social security office again and told them what my mom told me, they issued me the wrong number and needed to give me a new one. They ended up doing that and she has since called the issue resolved, despite my credit reports still being fucked up. \n\nThird, she blew off helping me with college. The previous two issues were further complicated by my mom telling me I needed to move to another state to establish residency for a year, then she would move to the same state to a town with a community college in it so I could live with her and she would cover my rent and help pay for school. I was working two full time jobs to afford rent in a new city with no one I knew. I did that, and she said she needed another year to get organized. That was okay with me even though I was living paycheck to paycheck barely making a living, because she was promising to help me with pretty much everything. She put it off year after year, while promising me weekly she would follow through and move, until 5 years had gone by, I was struggling the whole time and telling her all about it, finally I told her she needed her to now help me like she said or I can't talk to her anymore. She told me she would not be moving or helping me with paying for community college. We haven't spoken since. When she told me that it completely broke my hopes and dreams, I was so depressed I stopped showing up at work as there wasn't a point to life anymore, and became homeless for a few years, before moving back with my dad to help him.\n\nI keep telling my family my only requirement for re-establishing contact is an explanation, why did she tell me it was too expensive and not serious enough when neither of those are true? They are telling me even though it's not the explanation I want to hear, it's the one I'm getting, she just thought it wasn't serious, it cost too much, that's it, and I need to get over it for the sake of the family. How does this make sense at all? Am I going crazy?\n\nTL;DR - Family is telling me to \"just get over\" my mom blowing off helping me with college or even having a social security number for me without any explanation, apology or even acknowledgement that she did these things, am I wrong for thinking that's unfair and not okay? \n\n",

f(17), have a crush on my best friend, f(18). for the sake of the story, let\u2019s just call her lydia. we\u2019ve known each other for a few years since we\u2019re in the same grade but weren\u2019t in the same class. we only got close about 1.5 years ago when we entered the same courses. i\u2019ve had a crush on her pretty early on\u2014since like a year ago.\n\ni have another best friend, f(19), who we\u2019re just gonna call layla. we\u2019ve been friends for the past 8 years since we share the same hobby and work in the same caf\u00e9.\n\nlayla and i organized an art exhibition at the place we work at, and i invited lydia to perform since she\u2019s a poet. through this, lydia and layla met for the first time and both kinda liked each other but didn\u2019t really know each other well at all. already knowing this made me hold back from telling lydia that i liked her.\n\nthis was in october 2023. in april of this year, i celebrated my birthday and invited layla and lydia among some other friends. after my birthday, they started texting. since the beginning of their dating journey, i was kinda included, especially in the beginning and during their arguments.\n\nat some point in their relationship, lydia and i were talking about our future and when she told that if layla and she had never met, we\u2019d probably already be in a relationship. we both admitted that we\u2019d been in love with each other this whole time but didn\u2019t have the courage to say it out of fear of losing our friendship.\n\nbut like i said, layla and lydia were already dating. lydia didn\u2019t know what to do, so i told her that i\u2019ll always be here for her, and we have our whole lives to figure things out. i said she should really try with layla because i didn\u2019t want to break her heart. layla\u2019s been through a tough time, and she claims i\u2019m the only friend she has left (apart from lydia now, but yk).\n\nso they ended up dating for real. a while before they officially got together, lydia talked to me again about this whole situation, saying the only reason she wasn\u2019t already in a relationship with layla was because of me. i reassured her again that she should try with layla, but i also told her i loved her so much and would wait for her if she needed me.\n\nlater this summer, at the beginning of the break, layla and i met up for an event in her village. we spent the whole time holding hands, cuddling, and talking about how much we loved each other. i felt extremely guilty afterward and apologized because it was disrespectful of me to signal that i liked her both verbally and nonverbally.\n\nduring the break, i stayed at different places, like my sisters\u2019 apartments, who live hours away. between visits, the situation with lydia happened, and i decided to cut contact with both lydia and layla while i was at my second sister\u2019s.\n\nbut i couldn\u2019t sustain it. layla still sent me updates about her and lydia\u2019s relationship, sharing little details and voice messages about the things that made her happy. she also texted me twice to say she missed me and hoped i was okay. lydia gave me the space i asked for, but layla complained when i didn\u2019t reply, even though i\u2019d told her i wouldn\u2019t.\n\nafter about a week and a half, i started talking to them again. a week later, layla and i went on a three-week trip to norway. layla kept texting lydia and telling me all about her, which broke my heart every time. honestly, i didn\u2019t enjoy the trip much because of that.\n\nnowadays, layla and i don\u2019t talk as much anymore\u2014maybe once or twice a week. lydia and i, however, are still really close and touchy. yesterday, we went to a christmas market two hours away because we saw a video and thought it looked nice. we held pinkies to avoid getting lost, shared food, and danced a waltz on the street when we heard music. it was magical and meaningful, but also confusing.\n\nlydia is still with layla, but their relationship seems rocky. they argue a lot, and layla often oversteps lydia\u2019s boundaries.\n\nin my head, it\u2019s still the start of summer, and lydia and i are running hand in hand through a field, walking at night, and watching fireflies dance in the sky. i miss all the things we could have been if i\u2019d just told her i loved her earlier. it shatters my heart to see them kiss, but at the same time, i\u2019m happy my two best friends found love. i\u2019m glad it\u2019s me who\u2019s heartbroken and not them, because i love them both too much to want them to hurt.\n\nif you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you for reading. if you have any tips on how to get over your best friend, feel free to share them.\n\nnote: layla is unaware of the entirety of lydia\u2019s and my situation.\n",

I got up to go to work Monday morning and noticed he hadn't left for work yet so I needed him to move his car so I could get out, he told me he wasn't doing good at all with his mental health and felt like self inflicting again so I called and told boss I wasn't going to be in at work because I had an emergency I needed to help sort out. I get my friend to talk to the right people on the phone to try get him help, he does take the calls and gets a couple things sorted out. After that I double check that he wasn't going to have a spicy Lettuce smoke for the rest of the day as we both smoke and he ensures me he won't, I do my best to help him during the day and distract him by watching a movie that we both wanted to watch, once the movie finished he said he was going to go have a nap and I hear him then go outside and have a smoke.\n\nWhat I want to know is AITAH for now thinking to myself that I can't keep helping him and hindering my mental health when he doesn't help me anywhere near as much even when I really need it.

Firstly when they originally met at the gym they were both dating other people, SIL broke up with her boyfriend (they only dated 3 months) because she liked Gus more. Gus told her that he would break up with his girlfriend and eventually told SIL that he had done so. Since then he has love bombed her and gaslit her whenever she spots something that doesn't add up. Gus still lives with his \"ex\" as they had bought a house together and he told SIL that he was waiting to be bought out of the house before he moved out. Over SILs birthday weekend he told her that he was at a mental health retreat provided by his work (as his work is a high stress job), he told her that he was having to write journals and have therapy, and told her he'd written a 5 page love letter to her. I could write a book with how many little lies he's told over a span of 1 year.\n\nRecently he's been promising SIL that he would move in with her, but he kept pushing back the date. Well it was supposed to happen on Monday and we just had a gut feeling it wasn't going to happen. SIL showed me his exes Instagram account which was private and she said she wished she could see it. Well I ended up making a fake Instagram account so I could follow her, days later she accepted so I gave the login straight to SIL so we could look together. Well it turns out while he was on the \"mental health retreat\" he was actually on holiday with his \"ex\". And she'd posted a few photos of them together over the past few months. SIL called Gus straight away and confronted him and he admitted that he was still in a relationship and that he supposedly really was going to move in on Monday and \"make it work\". \n\nNow the question is, we've been saying that if we were his \"ex\", we would want to know. MIL is saying that she doesn't think it's a good idea because it would be coming from a place of spite towards him rather than care for her as we don't know her. She has forbidden us from messaging her. SIL has a few friends who have suggested that they would message her to tell her the truth but I'm not sure if they will actually do it. My SIL said she wouldn't be against someone telling her as long as she wasn't aware of it. WIBTA if I were to go against my MILs wishes and tell Gus' \"ex\" that he's been lying to her too? ",

      "selftext": "I work in the legal department at a corporate job. This girl, lets call her Frank joined the company 6 months ago. We have the same position.\n\nFrank knows my boss from outside of work and that's how she got the job. Come to find out she fluffed her resume a little too much. She has zero negotiating skill and legal background despite bragging about her \"experience\". My boss has come to see through her BS and no longer favors her.\n\nFrank undermines me in front of my bosses and is constantly trying to one-up me. She has called multiple meetings where she basically calls me out for not teaching her about the duties or a certain task. Even though I have spent HOURS teaching her, to the point that some days all I do is answer her questions. Additionally, after we review certain tasks during the meeting she does not even attempt to do them.\n\nThe following situation broke the camels back... Last week she asked me to complete \"urgent\" work for her while she was on PTO on top of covering her inbox on top of the work I also need to do. The following day, when she got back from PTO she felt the need to call me and let me know that I completed one of the \"urgent\" tasks incorrectly and basically told on me to my boss. \n\nThis triggered me, admittedly more than it should have. I talked to my boss about the situation and she told me that I should talk to Frank about it. So the next day, I ask Frank to speak with me in a small breakout room so our other coworkers could not hear. I let her know that I don't mind covering \"urgent\" work in emergency situations and happy to cover incoming requests. But not to leave me work to do while on PTO. I told her that I had to stay late to complete her work. WELP, she proceeded to get extremely defensive and confused as to why I was talking to her. I should have wrapped up the conversation as soon as I noticed she was not going to take it well but did not back down. I further explained if she has an issue with a task I have completed to come to me before going to our Boss. Our Boss does not understand the day-to-day tasks as well as we do, so I should be her first line of defense before asking the boss questions. Although, I could tell she was still fuming, she thanked me for talking to her and said she understood. She than proceeded to tell me that she was still confused about certain tasks so I spent an hour reviewing emails with her. The conversation did not go great, but I felt like we had a better understanding. \n\nWe go back to working at our desks... A couple hours later she stands up and accuses me in front of our coworkers of deleting her emails. I would never do that. So I told her we both need to speak with our boss. We speak with our boss and she continues to accuse me of deleting emails (even though IT could recover them).  \"She starts to cry and tells us that I \"hurt her heart\". I ended up hugging her, bc even though she drives me insane, I'm not totally cold hearted. \n\nAnyway, AITAH? Obv, this story is one sided. ",

      "selftext": "Context I, F(39) was invited to a lunch at an auntie house. My whole family would be gathering there and we made the effort to go, despite being at the other end of the country. Me and hubby M(41) and our daughter (2) were making preparations the day before when I got a text from my dad saying the lunch was being moved to my cousin's house because we were too many people and his house is bigger. I started getting uncomfortable but I decided it would be ok. \n\nI had never went to my cousin's house and it's been a while we've seen each other. I should mention when we were little, he is 2 yrs older, he would grab me and feel my behind and it was really uncomfortable. I think he was 12 and I was 10. It went on for a while and although it never went beyond that I really hated it. My husband knows about this and he was reluctant but I put it behind me and we went anyway. \n\nWe went and everything was fine, my cousin is married to his high school sweetheart and they have 2 kids, the food was great, the environment was great until I realised how much my husband and cousin were getting along. Seems they've many hobbies in common and they were so interested in talking about it that my husband seemed to forget about what I told him. \nFast forward to later that evening he told me they made plans for an online gaming session to which I completely flipped. I told him I didn't want him hanging out with my cousin and that he was not being supportive. \nI first asked that of him in a very polite manner but I also realised I've lost my shit when he told me he asked my cousin about what happened when we were kids and that my cousin told him he never thought too much of that and that it was just kids being kids. My cousin told my husband we even had so a few kisses and that he thought it was just us exploring and that he never sexualised it beyond that. He asked my husband if he and I should speak about it and that in his mind he wasn't doing anything against my will. \nI completely lost it at this point because I never meant to kiss my cousin or let him feel me in anyway. \nTo make it worse my husband said I was making it sound worse than I should and that if it was that bad that I should clear it with my cousin. Is it so bad to ask him to simply drop being so nice to my cousin? \nAITAH here? ",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone \n\nI'm 25F. My \"friend\" is also 25F. I say it like that because we're not really friends. We had 1 class together 5 years ago and we did definitely bond, but we never spent any real time together. She moved away and we sort of kept in touch via social media but only by liking each others posts. \n\nJust some background: I stayed in campus accommodation for the majority of my adult life so far and only recently got a place of my own. I don't know how to say this but I'm MAJOR into privacy. I don't like other people in my space so I never invite people over. When people have to come over, or when I feel obligated to invite someone over, I'm so in edge and uncomfortable the entire time and get panic attacks before and after. This is something I've addressed in therapy and it's getting slightly better with time but I'm not quite there yet. \n\nBut this friend doesn't know this. She doesn't know that I lived on campus. She doesn't know that I've since gotten my own place. She doesn't really know anything personal about me. Although, I don't have ANY family. I was pretty aware that she at least knew this. \n\nAnyway, she sent me a Facebook message asking me if she can come and stay with me for about 3 weeks. Arriving THIS WEEK. Even if she assumed I had my own place, I feel it's weird to assume I had space and and the capacity to accomodate her for 3 weeks? But apart from all of that, we really never even spoke. Why would you want to live with someone you hardly know, for three weeks? \n\nShe's also one of those people who have thousands and thousands of Facebook friends so I also find it strange that she couldn't have asked anyone else. Maybe she did and no one else was available but... Yeah I don't know. \n\nI want to say no but I feel so bad. I feel like a bad person but wow... Isn't this a bit... Inappropriate? Please tell me if you think I'm in the wrong here.\n\nEdit/update: Thank you so much everyone for helping me navigate this, it really helped my anxiety a lot. I told her I won't be able to accommodate her and she asked if she can then ONLY keep her car at my place, then? Why would she ask that?... I don't feel comfortable with that either so I'll be saying no but I was just wondering why she'd ask.",

I am not anything like either of my parents or the rest of my family and do not believe in religion or arranged/forced marriages as well as a lot of other stuff I was raised with. \nMy problem is my parents do not want me to go to university and want me to get married, which i absolutely refuse to do. They say that if I do wanna go or if they find out I've applied that I'll be kicked out and disowned. Similar concept for if they found out about my atheism or that I'm bisexual. I would be left homeless. My current place of education has offered to move me out into independent accommodation for my own safety should I choose to accept it. \nI really want to go, I'm tired of being locked in my room and not allowed to see or talk to friends. Or wear what I want, or go places outside of education and my mosque and I want to be given the option to work and go to a gym and have hobbies. I'm tired of ripping out my nails and skin and hair because of the constant anxiety. And not being able to have social media accounts and contact people outside of family. And I'm tired of making excuses for my parents being both physically and emotionally abusive my entire life. My father once smashed my phone with a hammer because I didn't do one piece of homework when I was like 14. But I also feel such guilt and heartbreak at never seeing my parents or older brothers again. I'm scared that what they say about me not being able to survive being independent and no one caring for and loving me the way they do is true and that I'll end up being miserable.  I know my actions will deeply hurt and impact my family and their reputations\nWould it be TA for leaving without warning?",

      "selftext": "I (25F) met Ryan (29M) a year ago through a video game. We played regularly and eventually started trying other games together. Over time, I began noticing Ryan\u2019s attitude toward Josh (28M), someone I\u2019m interested in. Ryan often criticized Josh, which felt odd. I didn\u2019t ask Ryan directly about his feelings because, in the past, I\u2019ve been heavily criticized for asking, \u201c*Are you interested in me?*\u201d and was manipulated into feeling crazy. I was afraid it would happen again, so I kept quiet. Instead, I talked about Josh and our relationship to make it clear I wasn\u2019t interested in Ryan.\n\nRecently, I started a new game, and Ryan followed me there. Another player, Kyle (25M), after a week of playing, I had mentioned Ryan and Josh to him, and Kyle said that he felt the same way as Ryan did. He told me he thought I was flirting with him. For instance, I sometimes call people \u201c*champion*\u201d or cheer them on during fights, but I see it as being friendly, not romantic. My way of flirting is different.\n\nWhen I confronted Ryan, he claimed I had been flirting with him all along but wasn\u2019t romantically interested himself. He cited moments like me jokingly calling him \u201ca man to marry\u201d the first time we played (because he can cook), or a time in the game when I had asked how much he weighed (because the game has a weight system). He responded, \u201c*If I tell you, will you tell me yours?*\u201d and I replied, \u201c*No, in the game, because I think my game bugged*\u201d and he ignored that and told me his real weight anyway. From there, we ended up discussing our physical traits. He even guilted me into sharing a photo of myself after sending me pictures of him unprompted, I didn't want them, later accusing me of flirting through that as well.\n\nI apologized for any misunderstanding and clarified I was only interested in Josh. However, Ryan called me dishonest, and after a very long talk going in circle, he insulted me, and blocked me. I\u2019ve since learned one of his longtime friends recently stopped talking to him due to similar behavior, where he refused to admit he was wrong about something (it wasn't the first time between them), so I wonder if this is a pattern. Kyle thinks I\u2019m the asshole for \u201cleading on\u201d men by being overly friendly and joking with them and that I need to be careful in the future.\n\nNow, I don't know, was I actually flirting and being an asshole, or were my actions misinterpreted? Am I in the asshole ?\n\n**TL;DR**: I was friendly with a guy (Ryan 29M) I met in a video game, but he thought I was flirting. I apologized for the misunderstanding, but he called me dishonest, insulted me, and blocked me. Now I wonder if I was really flirting and by that being the asshole or if he misinterpreted my actions.\n\n",

      "selftext": "I know this might sound like a stupid question but I genuinely need to know, I feel so bad. So basically I recently lost feelings for my boyfriend of two months, it was going great but then I lost feelings, he did some things such as, say I 'eat way too fucking much', call me weak in front of his friends, and a few other things which I'll mention in a bit. So, a while back me and my boyfriend got together at a party after one of our mutual friends set us up. It was going great for the whole two months, until he started saying or doing things that just slowly made me lose feeling before I realized it.\n\nOne time, I had gotten extra chips because no one else wanted them, they were enough to fill a quarter of those nasty brown paper lunch bags and as we were walking away and I was munching on my food he said, and I quote, \"You eat wayyyy to fucking much.\" And idk, that just hurt, he said it again a few days later when my friend gave me some lunch, (He said it when they walked away).\n\nAnother time, we were walking and talking on a date, and I told him that I have some SH tendencies and I was trying to get better but I often relapse, and his reply to that was \"Do you not care about me?\" And that was just a major red flag. For me, at least.\n\nNext, we were having a snowball fight with a group of friends, and I was off on the side cause I got iceballed right in the eye, and since it's a snowball fight, one of my friends was going to hit me, fair game, mad respect. But my boyfriend stepped in front of me to take the hit, and y'know what he said? \"I protect the weak!\" Like? Sir? Yeah, no.\n\n(Here is some context for this next thing he did. We're in a band, I play trumpet and he plays tuba.) So, we were talking about one of our pieces, and he objectively has one of the best parts because of how funky it sounds and I agree that it sounds amazing. And, as a trumpet, I usually get the main chorus for songs, so, my part wasn't as funky but still, it was really good. And sometimes I feel like I'm overreacting about this but my friends say I'm not, but basically he said, and I quote, \"Your part sucks, it's so bad.\" And that's just...? Sir?\n\nAnother thing to mention, his love language is physical affection, and he always clings to me, and I heavily dislike physical affection, and I have told him this, multiple times. I've been SAed before and when I first did we were dating, so this was really recent, when I got SAed, he didn't care, just said I'd forget about it the next day. So... yeah.\n\nAnother thing he did was when we first started dating, he kept misgendering me and whatnot which was annoying af considering he didn't know me prior to my transition (I'm a trans guy).\n\nAnd what I think is the final thing that made me lose feelings for him is that we were in a class and it was really stressful and I was leading our group and on the verge of a panic attack, and not once did he care enough to comfort me, he just said \"You're always like this. You're fine.\" And one of our group members who I barely talk to was able to comfort me better than my bf could.\n\nAnyways, now, on to the reasons I feel bad for breaking up with him, he was cheated on before and was really depressed. He always tells me I'm the reason he's not depressed, which is... uh... something, and like, I guess he's not really meaning to do all of that but still. I'm going to break up with him tomorrow and I just wanna know if I'll be an asshole for doing so.\n\nHe's a good guy and I don't want him to be depressed, I struggle with depression and it's absolute horse shit. I wanna end things on good terms and still be friends but I don't know if he'll want that, even worse is that I have more than half my classes with him.",

He doesn't care about climbing but has never expressed any issue with me doing it or doing it without ropes.\n\nBut the past couple of times I've been out he was annoyed with me about it and making comments about how he didn't understand why anyone would enjoy climbing.\n\nI asked him about it, and he said as we've moved out of casual dating to a proper relationship he's gradually become more uncomfortable with my hobby out of concern for my safety. \n\nI offered that I would stop free soloing because I don't want him to worry too much, but he has expressed that his issue is with climbing in general. He asked if I would stick to indoor climbing gyms only. And I refused.\n\nWe had an argument about it because he says I don't care about him as much as I say if I don't stop. \n\nWhereas although I get his worry, I think it's too much of a restriction and an overreaction given that he's known that I love climbing since we met.\n\nBut aitah?

We live a two hour flight from my husband\u2019s family (his mum, dad, brother, SIL and sister) but talk to them regularly via virtual means. \n\nWhen our baby was 4 weeks old, we went to go visit them so that everyone could meet our baby. This was the first time they had met her and it was a big thing for my husband\u2019s parents. The first day was planned to be a family get together for our baby and to celebrate her arrival.\n\nNow my SIL has a habit of loving everything to be about her, and doesn\u2019t really like talking about anything that doesn\u2019t relate to her (ie. when she was pregnant, I had to know all the details, the nursery plan ect, yet when I was pregnant 12 months later - she couldn\u2019t have cared less. Same goes for engagement and our weddings). Everything has to be about her. I have shrugged it off in the past as that just \u2018being her\u2019 however for the first time, I am an actually quite annoyed. \n\nAt this gathering, within 30 minutes of everyone walking through the door and hardly seeing us or anyone getting to talk about our baby she dresses her toddler in a \u2018big brother shirt\u2019 - to announce to everyone they are pregnant again. Whilst I am happy for her and my BIL, I am also quite annoyed that they couldn\u2019t even give us this time to be about our baby because of course, then all she could talk about was her pregnancy so far, talking about what we think the gender might be ect,her plans for work ect\u2026..she couldn\u2019t have appeared any less interested in her newborn niece if she tried. I just feel like that has cemented in my head that everything really does have to be about her and she is just that self centred.\n\nAITA for being annoyed?? ",

I was tired and didn't take her for a walk when i got home but i let her out and tried to play with her and walk around the backyard to get her to go pee. She didn't. i try to let her out as often as i can remember, but it's hard because she gives very little signs about having to go. it's about 9:30pm right now and i'm getting ready to take her for her walk when i see she's peed on my bedroom floor (not a problem, i'm cleaning it up as i type). my dad comes down and notices. i go upstairs to get paper towels when i overhear my mom saying i am taking advantage of the dog and that what im doing is unacceptable. i don't really get what i did that was so bad so im asking you guys to let me know if i am actually responsible for this and am in fact taking advantage of my dog. if i am, i want to try to change and be a better dog parent. i personally don't think anyone is really at fault here since i think it was just her having an accident as we're still learning about her, but it feels like my mom is blaming me.

Every time, he tells me \"why?\" and says \"he's seen all of me already!\" his reactions are so lame and boring. I thought no matter how many times we've seen each other, the sexual attraction should still be there, well turns out that's only my part. It's gotten to the point where, he has no reaction at all, none, NA-DA, zero!!!! So, I get disappointed every time, it's a turn off, like dude I barely wear lingerie, I'm barely this sexy (lol), I'm taking photos in ways that I've never done before. Like, I'm so caught up being a mom, but when I'm not busy and caught up, when I have time to myself and feeling myself, dressing up, looking good, he doesnt even initiate sex or anything, it's always me. So, to get my satisfaction, I started secretly sending photos to guys that I've met online, and they give me the reaction that I want, that I crave for from my husband. I get a sense of happiness, that I'm still pretty,  still wanted. My husband makes me feel ugly, unwanted. So am I the asshole? I know some may consider this cheating but damn, I just want to feel attractive and wanted by my husband. I'm only 27 yrs old. Ugh. We got into an argument two days ago because he found out. ",

He was fully engaged earlier this same year but it didn\u2019t work out. \n\nNow fast forward, we have been talking daily since we met, things have been great overall, we clicked as good friends early and can see it becoming more.\n\nHowever, this is where I\u2019m getting very confused. He has been drafting a message to send to his ex-finance and claims the purpose of the message is to clear things up and make it his last message to her. His ex was having mental health issues and he believes he is the best person in her life to help her get through those struggles. The message involves him telling her to take care of herself and he wants to give his friends number over to her in case she needs any help during any other crisis. I think that any and all communication with an ex fianc\u00e9 should end when you start a new talking stage with a whole different person. She knows very well who she is able to reach out to and not reach out to, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s his job anymore to worry about that. \n\nFurther, I think it\u2019s weird that he\u2019s considering her so much. I have been extremely clear about how I feel about this and that I am not okay with it, however he still keeps bringing up the message thing. He also told me he won\u2019t do it if I tell him not to but I think he shouldn\u2019t put me in this weird position in the first place. \n\nRecently, I asked him if there has been any communication between him and his ex, he told me no. However later, he told me she wished him happy birthday very recently but he didn\u2019t respond. I definitely believe that counts as contact, he should\u2019ve told me that earlier. He actually wanted to send her his draft on her birthday but decided against it. Now he\u2019s wanting to send it to her some other day, and also won\u2019t let me see the draft. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m being silly believing him and I\u2019m disrespecting myself. He lives in a whole other state and I try to trust him but I can\u2019t comfortably do that under these circumstances. Further I\u2019m a law student trying to study for the bar exam. I was willing to even move states to be with him but I\u2019m not sure if this is the type of person I would want to be with. Am I trippin? Please help me with some advice and opinions thank you!!

I had zero friends because I always had to be home to help, I had no hobbies, and I struggled with depression and SI and even self harm as I got older and I was all alone. Fast forward to now and I\u2019m married and pregnant with my first child and I\u2019m stoked but it\u2019s been hard cause I just moved from California and I\u2019m staying with my parents while we look for apartments and save up. My little brother is grown up and he doesn\u2019t know how to do anything, he can\u2019t make age appropriate snacks on his own, keep up proper hygiene without reminders, my parents do everything for him and all he does is go to school, play hockey, and play Fortnite. No chores, no nothing. He screams and throws tantrums and my parents just ignore it and move on. It drives me insane cause even though I am super happy that my brother doesn\u2019t have my childhood, this is bad too! I just don\u2019t understand why my parents work in extremes and it\u2019s so hard to watch. My dad had parents who weren\u2019t around so he was basically raised by his sisters and my mum had to raise her siblings, so in their mind, I should be a 3rd mother to my brother. I play with him sometimes but I\u2019m an adult and both my parents work from home so I don\u2019t really see why I need to play mother even when I\u2019m pregnant. My dad left me home with my brother and said \u201cI made hard boiled eggs for him so when they are done peel them for him\u201d and that triggered me for some reason. I asked \u201che can\u2019t peel his own eggs???\u201d Which my dad said \u201cwell he\u2019s playing video games and you are his sister\u201d like, no! He can peel his own eggs! I gave up my childhood damnit this kid can peel in own damn eggs!!! Stuff like this happens a lot and just seeing him screams at my parents all the time and sit around and play video games all day without a thought in the world just kills me and it makes me wish my parents could just treat us somewhere in the middle where we are safe and comfortable but also taught age appropriate things. I feel bad cause I know it\u2019s not his fault he\u2019s a bully but it hurts so bad and I can\u2019t explain why. AITA?",

      "selftext": "Recently I went on a cruise with my bf of 53 years, her husband and a friend of hers from work. My bf and her friend work in healthcare. \n\nI\u2019m handicapped with COPD and back problems  and need wheelchair assistance to and from the plane. \n\nThey traveled to Miami on one airline and I flew to Fort Lauderdale on another, less expensive, airline but we flew out of the same airport. My flight left earlier than theirs. \n\nI drove us all to the airport and we went in together. They all traveled with backpacks and I had a carry on and a bag to check in that had a folding walker in it. I got no help from them with my luggage to the airline desk and they stood outside of the line to wait for me to check in before they left for their flight, not helping me to the wheelchair assistance desk that was on the way their concourse even though they could see how much pain I was in. \n\nMy flight arrived in Florida before theirs and an Uber took me straight to the pier. I waited about two hours for them to arrive at the pier. My bf found me sitting at a picnic table and motioned for me to follow her. \n\nShe, again, did not help me with my luggage. When I got to the entry point of the cruise those three went ahead to check in without helping me get to the wheelchair assistance area. The pain in my back was so intense it set off an asthma attack and I found a pole and slid down it to sit on the ground until someone came to help me. \n\nWhen I finally got checked in and wheeled onto the ship they were waiting for me right inside the entrance. Then we had to go find our muster station. They did not help me with my luggage at this time either.  After we got muster instructions my bf and her friend took the luggage to the stateroom and picked up our room keys. Instead of coming straight back to the muster station to get her husband and I, they took a tour of the ship and got their free drinks before bringing us our room keys. They did not bring my walker from my luggage for me to use. My bf had insisted that I not rent a mobility scooter for the cruise. \n\nI finally got to our room to get my walker and they wanted to get something to eat so we went to a burger place from a well known chef. My bf asked me how much I liked my burger and I said it was okay. She then whispered to her husband \u201cwe\u2019re not taking her on another cruise\u201d because I did not agree with her that it was the best burger I ever had. \n\nThey insisted that I be on the Lido Deck during departure from port. It started raining and they left to go inside without waiting for me. I had gone under a shaded area and sat down on a lounge bed waiting for the storm to pass. \n\nIt was a 7 night cruise. Every morning they all left to get breakfast without waking me up. I would be dressed and reading on my bed when they returned but before they even got into the room I could  hear my bestie say with a sneer that I wasn\u2019t even up yet. Her husband would be the first in the room and told her that I was awake and dressed. \n\nWhen she was planning the cruise I told her that I would be on the interior of the ship most of the time because my lungs don\u2019t react well to heat or humidity. I also take medication that warns me to stay out of direct sunlight. She was not happy that I would not go ashore when it was in the 90s and humid. \n\nAfter the cruise when her friend and I were headed back to her hometown (again using different airlines at differing airports) she and her husband stayed in Florida to take another cruise with their children/grandchildren the next day. \n\nI was going to their house to dogsit her male husky (and additionally, unplanned, her daughter\u2019s female husky \u2026 the sister to the male \u2026 that was in heat. Neither of the dogs was fixed). I had to keep them separated. \nThey knew I was unable to chase their dog if he jumped the fence. He did just that when their daughter\u2019s boyfriend brought over some doggy diapers when the male husky was outside. I did not notice that he was out of the yard until they phoned and told me that he was at the animal shelter.  I told them I\u2019d go get him but they had someone else do that. Then they called and told me I could leave because that person was going to take care of the dogs since I apparently couldn\u2019t be trusted to do so. \n\nThat\u2019s the last time they spoke to me. Three days after they got home from their second cruise I had not heard from them so I put a status on Facebook why I was ending the friendship (I did not use their names) and told them to have a good life.  A week later I blocked and unfriended them and friends I made through them and most of their family members. \n\nAITA?",

      "selftext": "Hi there reddit, trying to navigate a kind of sad situation that simply won't leave me alone so...here goes. Me and this guy, Jake, have known each other since secondary school (middle school for those not from the UK) when we got paired together for something in school and were pretty close ever since. Went to the same uni and were basically inseparable. We were always a pair of nerds so getting with girls never came easy but eventually I met my ex, Amy, through a DnD club we attended. It wasn't a love at first sight situation, we kind of got to know each other after a while, I developed feelings and one day I said hey, fancy a drink? We ended up dating some time later and I could tell it didn't sit right with Jake. I spoke to him and while he never said anything, I asked if we'd still be friends and I said of course. I mean, I always assumed we were still friends but I guess yeah, we drifted apart. For me, Amy was my world, and I just wanted to devote all my energy to loving her. Going out every other day with Jake or going on these long drives to cities and getting roped into going to a museum stopped. It wasn't malicious or hostile or anything, I just wanted to do these things with Amy instead.\n\nWe humoured Jake by taking him with us as a third wheel a few times, we even tried to set him up with some of her friends too. Never worked out. They were never interested, he was never interested, eventually we just stopped bothering. My time with Jake dwindled, eventually we'd see each other a couple times a month solo, the rest via DnD. One day he just stopped going, I assume because he never really had anyone else to play with and only really went for my sake which sucked, but I never pressed it. I saw Jake less and less, we talked online less and less. Yeah...things hollowed out. I should add we never stopped talking but it did reach the point where weeks could go by before one of us made a move by sending a funny tweet or whatever. I guess I just...never really noticed? Anyway, for a while things with Amy were rocky. The rope finally snapped around Halloween time. Horrible, messy breakup that more or less torpedoed my social circle. I had to stop attending the club because it was too awkward and most of my friends were mutuals I met via Amy. I was mentally and emotionally battered. So I went to the only person I felt I could rely on: Jake.\n\nI messaged him asking if he had a moment to talk, this must have been like early evening? No response. Sometime goes by and I see the discord mobile notification pop up. Message him again asking if he's alright? And then say I just really need a friend right now. Again no response. Some more time passes while he's offline before he responds back and apologises, saying he was at the theatre. Doesn't ask what the problem is or anything. Just that. I said it's great to see him, and then just admit, me and Amy broke up. He sends a hug emote and \"hope you're hanging in there mate\". It...kind of felt like a slap to the face. Honestly the whole conversation was painful. I needed a shoulder to cry on. He wasn't prepared to be it. Eventually I just asked if we could meet the next day and he apologised, saying he couldn't as he was attending a dinner. I asked with who and he got a bit weird and said it was a \"philosophy club\". I guess I got a bit desperate because I asked if I could come along and he just flat out said no. I didn't respond but he did message me an hour or so later asking if I'd like to meet for a drink at the next weekend. I said yes and we made some plans.\n\nSo skip ahead to next week and at the last minute he says he's been invited to another dinner, can we meet at a caf\u00e9 earlier in the day? I feel like I should have stood up for myself but I was so emotionally burnt out and had spent the better part of the week in bed, I just said sure, whatever. So we meet at this snooty caf\u00e9 by the sea front - he picked it - and he just didn't feel like the Jake I knew growing up. He was just so cold and aloof with this weird vagueness. I tried to ask him about this philosophy club and I never got a straight answer. When I asked how I'd join he did this weird laugh and said how only I'll know when it's my time to join. I dropped it after that and admitted I was in a bad way because of Amy. His response was something like \"well that's women isn't it? Play with matches, get burnt.\" Was quite taken aback and I guess he could tell because then he said \"you know, no woman no cry.\" I wasn't really in that right mental state to argue so I just said yeah. When I tried to push the breakup, he just wasn't interested and all his responses were either cold or sort of insinuated it was my own fault. I asked him if he had met anyone and he did that weird laugh again. I took that as a no. We wrapped up a bit after that and I said it was great to see him again and maybe we should go out for a drink sometime. He said maybe and I asked if there were any cute girls at his philosophy club and he gave me the most weird, 1000 yard stare and said \"It's a gentleman's club.\" After that he said he'd \"be in touch\". Didn't hear back from him so I messaged him Sunday to ask what's up? No response till Sunday. And even then that's when I prodded him. He says let's set a date for Friday, I say can we go check out this Warhammer group I've seen advertised? It took him two hours to respond with \"If we must.\" Thursday night: messages me to say he has to cancel, he's been invited to another meeting and this is \"very special\". I ask if he really can't give me one night and he apologises, saying this is very important to him. I left it there.\n\nSince then we've seen each other two more times. Both of them he was off and vague, clearly didn't want to be there and especially didn't want to hear any of my problems. We've spoken a bit online but again, he never really commits to anything and he just doesn't want to listen to anything I have to say. My first and only relationship ended in a car crash and I just want to share that with someone but he just won't let me and it fucking hurts me after everything we've gone through together. So I guess am I the asshole here? Should I keep trying to salvage what we had or should I just move on too?",

      "selftext": "I (M24) have once again, my luck, have become a victim of card theft. I recently visited a local fast food chain, where I had used the drive-thru and paid with my card. I was in a hurry to get to my office before my next client being I was on break; so I flew from there directly to my office after the transaction. That evening, I noticed my card was gone, and I most definitely am the type to misplace my belongings from time to time; but was under the general assumption it was amongst my belongings. Now, two days later still card-less (been using apple pay just assuming my card is somewhere in my possession), I received a charge from a local restaurant in which I definitely have not visited. I proceeded today to go down to the location and speak with the manager, who provided me with the phone number, signed receipt with time stamps, and the address where the order was delivered. After doing my own private investigation this evening, I was able to uncover the individual\u2019s name, and photos via instagram. I am sure the individual who used my card is the same person who did the transaction at the fast food establishment. My family personally thinks i\u2019m taking this too far being the charge was only within the 10-20$ range; but i\u2019ve been a victim of card theft before where i\u2019ve lost thousands, and been left at a dead end with no information, nor police cooperation. I don\u2019t necessarily want to absolutely mess someone up around the holidays, but I also don\u2019t wanna leave this unchecked.\n\nNote: I completely understand it\u2019s my fault for not double checking if I had my card post transaction, but I am an airhead sometimes and I was in a rush.

      "selftext": "\n\nso ill set the scene, i, (16M) and my two other friends (16F) and (17F) have hardly been talking due to me meeting new, and honestly nicer people.\n\nfor simplicity, ill be calling (16F) Z and (17F) A.  we have been friends for 7 years before all of this.\n\ni felt like an asshole because those new people were the ones A had introduced me to, i ended up clicking with them faster than A did, and to this day we are close friends. but i know how it feels to introduce two friends to once another and slowly watch them get distant from you. so i did everything in my power to try and get them to connect.\n\nlater i realized i cannot force a connection between A and those people, obviously. i do realize this was overcompensation on my end, so instead i focused on starting conversations with her personally, using topics i knew they enjoyed so we could keep talking, but it was hard to get them to reciprocate or reply at all. \n\nafter a while of this cycle, i confront A for the first time, asking if anything was wrong because they werent nearly as reciprocative as she used to be. they tell me its just because shes exhausted from school and needs some time to herself, so i respect that and give her space.\n\nuntil i notice shes talking to Z alot more than shes talking to me, i disregard it at first because i assume theyre talking more since theyre in the same classes and have work to do together. \n\nthen later i also notice theyre playing games i had been telling them i wanted us to play together, but they kept shutting me down because they werent available. so i try confronting her about this again\n\nshe told me the same thing, that she was busy with school and work apparently. this is where i feel like something is up because she never even told me she had a job in the first place, i'd assume despite being busy you'd still think to update your so called best friend of 7 years about your first job right? obviously i dont make this my main point of focus when confronting her since it wasn't the main issue, it was just what helped me realize the way she was acting wasnt as normal as she made it seem.\n\ni tried asking Z if she knew what was going on, she said the same thing almost word for word, so i knew talking to her wouldnt have been very helpful.\n\ni eventually went to those other friends about it for a third party opinion, i didn't want to tell my family considering everyone was close and i didnt want to raise any tension between them if it turned out nothing was wrong, so i wanted to talk to somebody who had little to no involvement in our circle for this.\n\nthey eventually tell me its worth a shot to try and talk to them again, in a less sugarcoated way so i can really get my message across. and if they still wont make an effort, its better to drop them. those friends end up unfriending A on all socials, this detail will be important later.\n\ni insist a little more on getting information out of her, shes always had history of being avoidant when confronted but it was never this bad until i met my current friends. as expected nothing really came out of it until a couple days later. \n\nshe \"apologizes\" to me in a paragraph where she brought up several topics. the apology was something along the lines of \"sorry i've been distant, i'll play games with you another day\" \n\nand immediately it made me feel childish, because why was i upset over the fact she played games without me right?\n\nbut the fact that later in the paragraph she tried guilt tripping me by bringing up her fight she had with her brother made me doubt how seriously she was taking how i felt about this.\n\nin response i wrote back another paragraph, more blunt than the last one fully explaining what i had noticed from her from the very beginning, everything i mentioned in there i've already tried communicating the past but they were brushed under the rug by her, so this time i was more blunt about wanting her to listen to me for once.\n\nto try and summarize it, i explained that i didnt care about the games we played and how much we talked, i just wanted to make sure there wasnt any animosity between us because thats what it was starting to look like and i wasn't sure what i had done wrong but whatever it was i just wanted to know so i could fix it asap.\n\nshe snaps back at me and tells me that if she was actually being distant she wouldn't have come to Z's birthday party knowing i was there and that she was glad i understood we could keep our bond without talking all the time. \n\nthen she says . word for word, \"you didnt have to tell those two people, but you do you buddy \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\"\n\nso this indicates shes upset, and im just really lost because all ive been trying to do was try to be honest with her and how i felt. \n\nbut this is where i really felt and still feel like i was the asshole, maybe i kept poking at something that was never really an issue to begin with until . well, until it actually became an issue. \n\nwe agreed that we needed a break from one another until further notice, so things stayed quiet for about a month.\n\nuntil Z eventually messages me, she comes up to me asking what the hell is going on between me and A and that she wanted answers, so i explain everything from my perspective.\n\ni later realized that was useless because she only messaged me to be angry and \"stand up\" for A.\n\nlong story short, Z told me i shouldve never confronted A in the first place because i should've known she doesnt like confrontation, therefore i shouldnt do it at all and that i was too rude about it, she followed that up by saying she needed to talk to me about topics that shes been holding in, how she felt like she couldnt be her real self around me because she felt like i'd judge her and refused to elaborate when i asked what i said or did to make her feel this way, she seemed to just.. want to be angry at me until she got a negative reaction out of me.\n\nthis eventually led to Z threatening to cut me off, which i ended up telling her to because we weren't getting anywhere and she refused to talk to me while in a better headspace and wanted to resolve things one way or another, so i gave her what she wanted.\n\nanyway, there may be things i need to clarify but AITA here?\n\n",

I love swimming especially in the beach and I am a trained competitive swimmer, while he does not know how to swim. There was a day we went to a very calm beach on a holiday with alot of people on the beach and as I usually do, I go out in the deep where I can have peace and swim,float, relax without bumping into anyone. I'm 5 ft tall and if I was to do. A little hop and dive into the water my feet would touch the bottom while my head would be just under the water..that's how deep I was when he decided to come over by me and try to drag me to shore. I said I didn't want to come to shore right now and I'll come and join him and his sister when I'm finished swimming. He said it was dangerous and because I'm fat I don't know how to save myself as well as I could of in my competitive days. I again said I'm don't want to go to shore and I'm okay right now. I continued to swim while I heard a splash and as I turned I saw him beating up in the water and sinking so I swam back to him and pushed him up and he stood on both feet and looked at me panicked. He laughed and said he was fine when I asked him repeatedly and then he went to shore and sat down. On our way home both him and his sister said I was in the wrong to making him go into the deep and nearly Drown. If I wasn't in the deep then he wouldn't have nearly drowned while trying to get me and if something happened to him it would be my fault. AITA?",

Dean and I were not aware of this.\n\nSIL then, according to SMIL, accidentally called Dean her son in front of the extended family after we moved. This has put it in her head that this might be possible. \n\nI don't know quite what to do, I ha ent told Dean about this yet because it's ridiculous and sounds too much like a soap opera or something.

We are closer to my \"family\" (not related but the closest I've got to family really) and we've had a full social calendar since we've moved. \n\nI told a friend about this and she says I have to talk to Dean about this so he's not blindsided later and I would normally agree but I hate that this woman has been on our minds so much of the time all the time and don't want her to continue to ruin what we have.

      "selftext": "Hello all, I (28F) have been with my husband (M30) for almost 5 (married2.5) years. \n\nIn the first two years of us dating we were both having fun, going out together and our friend groups, having a great time. He is in the service, so when his contract came up in Kansas, and his new one was in Europe, we decided we were going to try out the distance for a little while and then get married if it worked out. \n\nIt was almost over a year and a half of dating, and making it through some tough things together. He never gave up, and neither did I so I had really high hopes that this would be a good thing. He seemed really genuine, cared, paid lots of attention to me, and worked hard, It all was something that anyone would see as a good thing. The only thing that we had left to master was our own finances as we both seemed to be struggling with money, but with love and choosing each other, we could get through anything. \n\nLong backstory short, after marrying him, I found out that he struggled with finances REALLY badly. This was not found out truthfully till after marriage. After asking that I have access to his accounts so we could get our crap together he allowed us to share passwords to our banks. Thankfully, it was not in the 50K+ debt kind of bad that he was in, but the bad that every single dollar would be gone in his bank account and he had begun to get cash advances to try to \"give himself\" more money. (EDIT- This has since been corrected and no more advances happen.)\n\nMost of the spending was on.. LITERALLY buying food and snacks. At least $1600 of his leftover money after bills was just.. thrown out on takeout and gas stations. Upon furthur inspection I quickly saw that he also hid a good sum of money from me too. \n\nHe was military, so with him being stationed in Europe, and myself staying back in Kansas, we were able to get a housing allowance. Which was a certain amount that was given to us depending on our location. \n\nShortly after getting married, he submitted paperwork at the beginning of the month. WITHIN THE NEXT CHECK, housing was added. He told me nothing. For three pay checks, it totalled to be at least 6k with his regular income.. And it was ALL. GONE.\n\n I was also bad with money when we were dating, but after that frontal lobe developed at 25, and getting married, I was doing lots of things before and in the meantime to fix my situation. Doordashing, instacarting, everything on top of my full time plus job. I didn't want to be that wife that is awful with money. I wanted to be able to contribute. I have goals, and he did too. So it definitely made me PANIC seeing that he has been this way as far back as the statements could go. Why was he allowing me to be struggling with figuring out my stuff when he could have sent me the amount of the housing that we agreed upon? None of that money went to extra payments on anything, paying anything off... it was just.. all spent on again.. Food and gas station snacks and random stuff.\n\nAfter telling him how much he was literally pissing down his own leg, and for leaving me to struggle, I had to take control of the finances. I had tried to let him run a budget on his own, but he immediately could not do it. It was all gone again and again.  I had to take over, or leave. I had to argue and pretty much threaten him that I wasn't going to live like this if he wanted to have me around. He did agree he had a problem, so he eventually let me have control. \n\n I literally had to give him a set allowance, and I kept his money in my account safe. I paid all the bills, and threw as much as I could into the savings account. I accomplished a LOT quickly. I saved over 4k in a few months, paid off his phone, and was MONTHS ahead on insurance, and the phone bills. I even got his credit score up 130+ points. It was so bad that he couldn't have even used his Military VA loan it was so low when I got to dealing with the finances. It was becoming amazing. He had enough to screw off on or spend what he wanted, and even save if he felt like it, but I also accounted for if he didn't and kept up the slack. (spoiler, he didn't) \n\nSo here we are now. Two years later. We have been here in Europe, I finally got a full time job that is paying me pretty decent, we have been paying off Credit cards. I got his half of things totally gone. We have been taking small trips here and there to see countries and experiences. \n\nHe was totally debt free two months ago. All we had to do was just save..\n\nHe is now back in the states for school and I am in Europe now. The school is a trade school so it is only a couple of months then he comes back, and we begin to \"Clear\" to go back to the US.\n\n I had moved over here to be with him so that things were better between us relationship wise and financially. Not to mention the fact that I could live in Europe for a few years! \n\nIt cost a lot of money to get out here. So our savings have been put on hold. (0$) I got really stressed and tired with dealing with household and finances and a full time job so I agreed to let him be the one to save now since it had been some time, and things were improving. They \"did\".. except for now that he is back in the states, he has begun his spending frenzy and now, worse than before. Within two months, he applied for a bunch of credit cards, and has now racked up almost 3k in debt, and maybe 200$ in savings. He Had Hundreds in the account.\n\nWithin these purchases, he has purchased firearms, fast food, clothes, travel tickets to see family (that one is excused) but finally, STEROIDS. He does not \"know\" I know about. The firearms and Steroids were both not something that I was consulted in or ran by before he did this.\n\nHe had mentioned in passing him and his buddy were going to go look, but nothing about spending $800 on a few.  I had to see the transaction of the firearms and then confront him about it. He did not see the issue with this. \n\nWe have been arguing this whole last three months about it and the other friviolous purchases along with him hardly communicating with me. The Cup Is EMPTY.  He told me to be patient and little by little we will reach our goals. MO\\*\\*\\*\\*F\\*\\*\\*\\*R!!!!!  I sent you off debt free.. you could have been saving this whole time for the house that you are wanting and the future you say you so desperately want. Instead he is telling me that we are going to live with his mother for a few months and then we will be back on our feet...  He can't take the firearms back to Europe with him. It's Illegal. \n\nHe has been awful with communication. Hardly texts, and continues to gain weight (seeing from family pictures), and do whatever he wants. While I am trying to figure out what he means by ME be patient when we move back there in a short three or four months, and he just couldn't wait to do these things.. he had to do them... NOW?! \n\nMy one of my many final straws is the Steroids. He told me to stop only talking to him about the money, that he knows, and that he has it under control. I have literally stopped. Completely. I try to talk to him about anything but my concerns, I text, I don't, I wait, I respond when he texts, but the communication is literally nothing except for \"Hey Babe\" and \"WYD\" then nothing till the next day.\n\n If I do get a phone call he's always with someone and it feels like I am just sitting on the phone with him while he's chatting up with anyone else but me, or he isn't listening to me and definitely is on his phone while talking, or on some game of some kind. I explain to him about this issue too (which has been an in person struggle in our home life as well), but I am met with defensiveness, \"Confusion\", and shut down. I also get rebuttals about anything but what I am talking about.  It turned into a HUGE argument and us screaming at each other. He wanted me to stop.. so stop I did. Completely. I waited.. and waited. I was met with silence. (EDIT- he is a happy guy. He is 98% happy at all times just to add. But it\u2019s just like a \u201cworry about it when its DIRE\u201d. I cant tell if it\u2019s like on purpose or he literally cannot think ahead or just literally doesn\u2019t wanna deal with stuff.) \n\nThen after me \"stopping\" I saw a 600$ \"Health\" transaction. I had later checked the email, and saw an itemised bill from a site purchased on the internet with a list of things. This included: syringes, needles, and the products called, Testosterone Cypionate, Anastrozole, Enciomiphene Citrate. All of these things, from my understanding are for raising testosterone, sex drive, and..sperm count???  We are not trying for kids. I have a IUD. But suddenly, now he is pestering me about them. (I think because he is now currently on these medications)\n\nI don't want to have kids (not really at all, which he KNEW before marrying me), or even BEGIN to EVEN think of them at all till we have our own place, have a decent savings, and doing more things emotionally to make me know that he IS going to be responsible. He has shown me every time, that when I am not there, he will do what he wants and figure it out later. \n\nI feel completely held back, I feel like I am the only one worried about our future and plans, and all he can see is relying on these military loans. I DONT WANT TO BE LIVING OFF LOANS. We don't even have too. But he said that he is too old to be renting and that he is not doing that again and that he will have a house.. (but we're going to live with..mom????) I have blatantly told him how I feel, nicely, healthily, and even YELLING. I am just met with dismissal and the comment \"little by little\" and \"this is only temporary\".\n\nSo,  \nAITA for wanting to just call it quits when we get home? Im fed up with his \u201chappy-go-lucky\u201d laid back attitude. I am tired, don't feel heard, and frankly, I feel held back and not listened too at all so what is the point of it all?\n\n",

      "selftext": "Interested to bring this to the crowd\n\nFirst love many years ago, was totally head over heels. Dated her for six months and she dumped me. I was obviously devastated but said we could be friends. I\u2019d always been able to do that and I thought it would be okay. \n\nI didn\u2019t ever get a reason why, and it was all quite confusing at the time. She\u2019d told all her friends and me that I was the person she could see herself marrying/being with very long term.\n\nNevertheless, looking back I can now see the bad and not just the good. The fact she\u2019d constantly tell me about people asking her out on dates and to the gym etc (she was very pretty). I don\u2019t think she ever got the rise she wanted, my answer was always - \u201cI\u2019m not stopping you, but you know the outcome if you go\u201d. We also didn\u2019t have anything in common. \n\nThe next day after we finished, my friends and I were due to go out for drinks. I didn\u2019t know want to do anything but they were successful of coaxing me out of my room where I\u2019d spent the day depressed. Our circle of friends crossed over with my ex-gfs group and she turns up. I always thought that was super insensitive. I went upstairs back to my room and she left.\n\nThe same evening she messages me and tells me she loves me and wants to be back with me. I\u2019m naturally suspicious of this and ask all the necessary questions but she seems genuine. I go and see her in person and she tells me she wants a \u201ctrial\u201d period. My answer was an extremely emphatic no. We either go out or we don\u2019t. She wanted to go out, and I left. \n\nFor the proceeding couple of weeks, I\u2019m getting the cold shoulder and weird half-ass messages and time spent with her. I meet up with her to discuss it and she comes clean and tells me that she lied about wanting to go back out with me so that she could benefit from me having a big social group because she was not that sociable and in truth, not that well liked. I told her at this point, I wouldn\u2019t treat someone I hated in this way, and told her never to contact me again and I have never contacted her since. She told all her friends I\u2019d agreed to this trial period, I viewed it as mean. Not ego bruising, just standard mean. \n\nShe messaged me at Christmas. She messaged me at birthdays. I had her number blocked. I decided I could probably do the niceties and unblocked her when I was out on a night out. On that night out she sent me a tirade of mean messages saying I was telling people not to invite her to social events. I never did. This is the only time I spoke to her again of my own volition. I went to her house and told her to stop, and that I wouldn\u2019t ever speak to her. I never have. \n\nIn truth, it took me years to get over. Being young and in love is cool and sucks and I wouldn\u2019t change it. I don\u2019t blame her that much, I doubt she\u2019d do it again. Would love to know if people agree with me though, it was some top tier bellend behaviour. I don\u2019t think I was an asshole in completely ignoring her lol. My friends at the time thought it was a bit harsh but I presume that\u2019s an argument from convenience because of how the friendship groups crossed over. \n\n",

They started laughing thinking I wasn\u2019t actually mad but I was because I tell them almost everything and so do they but they didn\u2019t tell anyone so how would I even know?

      "selftext": "Me (20F) and my best friend (20F) have been best friends ever since the 6th grade, I met a boy (21M) in my freshman year of high school in my biology class and I had a crush on him for a while. Me and him shortly became close after the whole biology thing since we both got separated from all our friends in that class and resorted to talking to each other. I introduced him to my best friend about a month after me and him got close, and they instantly connected. I had already expressed my feelings about him to her, and she fully supported it but it seemed she didn't once they actually first met. December of that year they started dating, and I didn't get upset about it to her (might I add, she was the one who had apparently made every move). I decided to ask her about it anyway, just saying, \"I was just curious why you flirted with him so much, you knew I liked him?\" which she replied with something along the lines of, \"that's not my fault you also liked him, but in the end we really found out who he liked more,\" and I decided not to ask further. They dated all the way to college, it really seemed like they'd get married one day. I was always the third wheel, because I was super close with the both of them, and I didn't mind much. She broke up with him a few months ago for a different, more wealthier man than him and he's been absolutely heartbroken ever since. Last week, I came to his apartment asking if he needed anything since he was still absolutely out of it, like barely leaving his house out of it. My intention was not to hook up or anything like that, just wanted to be there for a friend, and at this point I had lost all feelings for him. He decided he wanted a movie night, like me and him use to have in high school. I sat a fair distance away from him, since he wasn't my boyfriend or anything, I didn't needed to be all cuddled up next to him. But it felt like the entire movie he was inching toward me, and at the end of the movie he just kissed me out of nowhere. I was shocked, of course, because all my feelings for him were gone and he went on this whole rant about how in love with me he has always been. I was just shocked and I just totally gave in. The next morning we decided to make things official, and a day later he posted a picture of me captioned, \"the love of my life,\" without my permission. My best friend totally blew up on me, and I replied with, \"you knew I always liked him and you still got with him, I know you two broke up but I'm still getting with him. Just doing the same thing you did,\" and I feel bad about that now and guilty for being with him. I'm sure I'm the a-hole for this but I don't know. ",

She just got her number changed, but only after I asked her to. This plus what happened today, makes me suspect that maybe she\u2019s not quite as innocent in this as she says, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if she\u2019s leading him on or giving him false hope somehow. Basically, I\u2019ve told her how I want to clobber him, and she told me that it makes her uncomfortable when I say stuff like that. I didn\u2019t want to stop, because I want her to know that I can protect her, and I feel like she doesn\u2019t see me as a real man when she won\u2019t let me even talk about confronting him even tho he\u2019s just some fat prick. \n\nToday we were at the super market and as we got close to the till, she told me to just drop our basket and basically dragged me around the aisle and out the front door. She told me when we got out that she saw her ex, then she got a text and showed me her phone, and it was an unknown number, she had two texts from it one was literally \u201cI miss you xx\u201d and the other was \u201ci seen u with another guy u cunt\u201d.

She said she just didn\u2019t think to and I said I don\u2019t believe her. I said she either thinks I can\u2019t win in a fight against some other guy or she\u2019s hiding something. She started crying and saying \u201cyou don\u2019t understand\u201d and that she doesn\u2019t care about whether I can win a fight she just doesn\u2019t want one of us to be killed coz the police don\u2019t care about it, I said she\u2019s avoiding the question why did she not block his number. She asked what I\u2019m playing at and I said I think maybe she\u2019s letting him think he still has a chance. She got angry saying that she has made it clear that she wants nothing more with him, but I said then why is he sending her \u201cxx\u201d and acting like she\u2019s his. \n\nShe said she won\u2019t talk to me when I\u2019m shouting and made me take her home. She said not to text her until she texted me and that she\u2019s real disappointed in me. She still hasn\u2019t got back to me I don\u2019t know what I should do. I don\u2019t want this guy harassing her but I feel like I need to know how much she\u2019s letting him think they still together even if it\u2019s not on purpose, I want her to think about it. I also want her to know that I can defend her and myself especially with someone like him. She gets so upset when I talk to her about this and she makes it hard to say anything. ",

My partner is LC with his mom, his dad lives over an hour away, and no one (to my knowledge) had done Christmas at all for years- welp we just weren't invited I guess? \nWe went to his cousin's this year for Thanksgiving and they said \"you guys should come for Christmas, good to see you\" and now my husband is dead set on it. My issue is, this part of the family doesn't like his dad because his mom left his dad for his dad's cousin, and so they're giving weird energy when we are there. Also, no one really talked to us, which I guess fair because we haven't been around (his aunt actually pointed out they've never met me and i'm \"brand new\" though I have been with him for a decade), but I know he wants to get back into that side of his dad's family because of our son being born and wanting that family connection.\nI feel like if they didn't make an effort for him to come around for the last decade, why all the sudden should we be jumping to and from 3 houses plus our own on Christmas?

      "selftext": "My FIL (~70) and I were never particularly close. When I met my husband in our late Teens, they had'nt spoken for years - FIL was a drunk and a loser who left MIL after their unplanned 3rd son was born and fled the country to avoid legal beef with tax authorities. Never paid child support and for years all the kids ever got from him was Yahoo e-cards on the high holidays. Now since a few years back, the two eldest sons (including my husband) have sporadic contact. All three boys are however pretty close with their grandma who recently turned 91. She's a sassy and funny but sweet old Lady and I like her a lot. Now, grandma wanted to come Visit for a weekend but due to her age and the long distance train ride she asked FIL to accompany her. They've done this before a few years ago and it was OK - FIL basically spent all his time in his room playing some facebook farm game and granny got to spend quality time with the great-grandkids. So I thought it would be the same deal this time around but boy was I wrong. First, he criticized me for making my son gay because I let him wear a Christmas dress. Then, the conspiracy theories started. At lunchtime, he started complaining about the [slur for black people] and the final straw was when I went for a quick shower and he started watching war videos about the islamists in Syria with our kindergartener. When I came out of the bathroom and saw this, I asked him to stop the video because it's not appropriate for kids and he basically exploded and screamed at me that I'm trash and he could never stand me. So I told him to GTF out of my apartment. Husband is generally on my side but thinks I should have \"handled it more professionally\" because \"he's too old to reason with\" and grandma left with FIL and seemed very hurt. Which I understand and I'm really sorry to spoil her weekend visit but I just didn't find it in me to be the bigger person and let it go. Now, AITA? And any ideas on how to make up for this with granny?\n\nTLDR: Kicked my nasty FIL out for showing my kindergartener war videos and generally being a prick. Ruined grandma in laws visit as collateral damage.",

      "selftext": "Before anything, English is not my first language. So I apologise in advance if this is a hard read, but please beware with me. \n\nSo, I (24F) and one of my best friends, let\u2019s call her Carol (23F), have been in each other\u2019s lives for about 12 years now. We went to the same school and always ended up in the same class. She knows everything about me, and I knew everything about her. We helped each other as much as two dumb teenagers with strict parents could.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that my parents are separated. At the time, I was living with my dad and my stepmother. I won\u2019t get too much into detail, but she used to beat me and make me work in her restaurant for 10 hours a day on weekends and holidays. That was one of the main reasons I left. When I turned 18, I ran away from home and moved to another country where I have some family from my mother\u2019s side. (Before you ask, there are separate reasons why my mom didn\u2019t get involved in this situation.)\n\nI went back home to visit family in 2022 for two weeks and let Carol know months in advance, in case she could also come back from university. At the time, she told me she couldn\u2019t, so my aunt said she would take me to Carol\u2019s place and pick me up a couple of days later (a 2 hour drive each way).\nI don\u2019t drive, as the city I live in now has great public transport, so getting a car would be a waste of money.\n\nFast forward to my holidays. I get to my aunt\u2019s place, and everything goes well until my uncle has to go to the hospital for breathing difficulties. He ends up staying there the whole time I\u2019m visiting. Obviously, I tell my aunt she doesn\u2019t need to take me to Carol\u2019s because I\u2019ll stay with her instead.\n\nNow, you need to understand that my aunt is like a mother to me. She cares about me and looks after me like I\u2019m her own child. She just retired recently, and until then, she was working in another country. Every time she came home, I was the first person she\u2019d visit. She\u2019s done more for me than either of my parents. (Also, my auntie has a son but he lives in another county, the same where she was working and living before retiring). \n\nSeeing her so worried and anxious, I just couldn\u2019t leave her. I called Carol and explained the situation. She was a bit annoyed but understood.\n\nI thought that was the end of it. We continued FaceTiming and messaging as usual, and everything seemed fine.\n\nUntil this year. Carol told me she was coming on a week-long holiday with her boyfriend and his mom to the country where I live. It\u2019s been nearly five years since we last saw each other.\n\nI asked her to leave one evening free so I could pick her up, take her to dinner, and then drop her back at the hotel. I even told her I wouldn\u2019t mind if her boyfriend and his mom joined us, I just didn\u2019t want to intrude on their family time. I was fine with anything.\n\nAfter a few days, she called to say that after talking with her boyfriend and checking their schedule, she wouldn\u2019t have time to meet me. When I suggested tagging along for whatever they were doing, she said it might be too awkward with his mom.\n\nI was pissed. What do you mean you can\u2019t take a couple of hours to see me? But I just said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and sent her my work address, suggesting she could visit me while I was bartending in a touristy area. That way, they could sightsee, and I could still see her.\n\nShe went back home, and we didn\u2019t end up meeting.\n\nAfter that, I didn\u2019t message her for a few days, and she didn\u2019t reach out either. But when I talked to my cousin, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t act like a child; just talk to her.\u201d She was right, I was being immature. So I messaged Carol and asked when she was free to talk.\n\nShe explained that the trip was paid for by her boyfriend\u2019s mom, and she didn\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable by bringing me along when we\u2019d never met. After that, everything went back to normal with us FaceTiming, messaging and checking in on each other.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, Carol stopped replying to my messages. At first, I thought she was busy with uni work and didn\u2019t want to bother her. But days turned into weeks, so I sent her a \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d message. She said she\u2019d been really busy but would call me when she had a break.\n\nShe never did.\n\nMaybe this is where I\u2019m the asshole, but I felt betrayed. She was always out with friends, posting about all the fun she was having on Instagram, but she couldn\u2019t call me back? So I stopped messaging her to see how long it would take for her to remember my existence.\n\nMy birthday came and went without a message from her. I thought maybe she\u2019d forgotten, but then she posted a birthday shoutout for someone else that same day.\n\nIs it childish if I decide not to message her on her birthday at the end of the month?\n\nI know this probably sounds like some teenage drama, but I just need some outside view on this. Some of my friends say that I\u2019m in the right while others say \u201cit\u2019s not that deep\u201d. \n\nBut yeah, thank you for taking some of your time to read this and potentially helping out. \n",

      "selftext": "My wife (31F) and I (33M) have been married for just over a year, and lately, I've been noticing something that's increasingly bothering me. It's making me want to become more emotionally reserved, though that's not what I truly want.\n\nThe issue revolves around physical affection, particularly cuddling. Whenever my wife wants to cuddle on the couch or be held, she expects me to drop everything immediately. It doesn't matter if our kids are running around screaming, if I've just returned from work exhausted, or if I'm in the middle of tasks for our joint side business. Even when I'm organizing the garage or basement, I'm expected to stop what I'm doing.\n\nIf I say something like, \"Just a second, let me finish this first\" or \"I'm in the middle of something I really want to complete,\" she becomes visibly upset and pouty. This behavior often makes me feel guilty, and I end up giving in and cuddling with her.\n\nHowever, the double standard is what truly frustrates me. When I want to cuddle and she's busy with her own activities\u2014whether it's cleaning or working on her schoolwork\u2014she often declines, saying she's \"on a roll.\" This has reached a point where I've started deliberately avoiding her or finding other things to do because I'm so angry about the situation. I feel like my physical needs aren't as important as hers, and that she only wants to give me physical attention when it's convenient for her, while expecting me to make her needs my top priority regardless of circumstances.\n\nI find myself wanting to refuse her requests for cuddles the next time she asks, but I know I'll probably give in because the guilt is overwhelming. I also find myself purposely disappearing when she declines my requests for physical affection. Am I wrong for feeling this way and reacting like this?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI want to thank everyone for their responses. After taking your advice, my wife and I had a conversation today that revealed some additional concerns about imbalances in our relationship that she hadn't previously recognized. We were both able to better understand each other's perspectives.\n\nHowever, I'm still feeling uncomfortable with some aspects of the situation. Now when we spend time together, she makes comments like, \"I don't want you to feel guilted into hanging out with us because I don't want to hear about how I did that later.\" The passive-aggressive tone of these statements doesn't sit well with me.\n\nThere's also an important context I should have mentioned earlier: I spent seven years in an extremely abusive relationship before my current marriage. My ex-partner's abuse was severe \u2013 I wasn't allowed to sleep in our bed or sit on the couch, and she even forced me to either walk half a mile to a gas station or defecate outside. Throughout that relationship, I was constantly trying to keep her happy at the expense of my own well-being.\n\nI'm realizing now that this traumatic past relationship is likely contributing to my sensitivity about the current situation. After spending years trying to please someone who was never satisfied, I'm particularly attuned to situations where I feel my needs are being dismissed or where I'm being manipulated through guilt.\n\nThis background helps explain why the current dynamic with my wife triggers such strong emotions in me, even though the situations are very different. My past experiences have made me especially sensitive to feeling pressured or guilty about meeting someone else's needs while having my own needs dismissed.",

Situations similar to this will be inevitable and we have to trust eachother and work on our relationship to make it work.

I like to help him because he has said he wants me to live with him multiple times.... I would have loved that, mostly because I liked him so much. I've never lived with a partner but I know it's difficult at times. I've lived with 3 different roommates and I know it's challenging at times but fun so it's worth it.\n\nLong story short, I tipped a bag of grout over and he said, \"this is why I don't want to work with anyone!\" He shouted this. I did not spill anything, but started to cry involuntarily, I tried to stop the tears but they came. I went home and cried a lot he tried to call me but I didn't feel like I could talk with him yet. While texting he said \"I get frustrated when people insist on helping when I don't need it\" I explained, \"I wil not offer my help anymore\". He said \"Sounds good, thanks.\"\n\nThis makes me think what would happen if I spill coffee or red wine, or juice even.... It makes me feel like I am wrong to help?\n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend is almost done renovating his house. I feel like he is mad at me for helping(due to him saying that) even though he wants me to move in). \n\n",

I\u2019ve always had my own little celebration on my birthday, and then we have a Christmas celebration on the holiday. I know it\u2019s a bit childish, but in these last few years I\u2019ve become a mother and my birthday became a pretty important event for me; it\u2019s a day I get to actually focus on myself and do something *I* want. \n\nThis year there\u2019s been some animosity amongst the family, due to some \u2018drama\u2019 that happened a while back between myself and another family member. We already squashed that issue, but a lot of the family still treats me very differently from the entire situation; I was told by one that the other family member had given a wildly inaccurate story of what had happened, but at this point I\u2019m not even interested in defending myself to them. If they want to believe something bad about me, I\u2019m letting them. \n\nAnd for that reason, alongside the fact I\u2019m going to be having another baby in February and will have to focus my attention on a newborn again, I\u2019ve been planning on leaving town for my birthday. I usually have a \u2018family party\u2019 where we all have dinner together, but I\u2019d already been wanting to go out of town for a while and my birthday was the perfect excuse to. My husband went to his work and got a couple of days off so we could leave town without worry, and I started getting really excited about it! \n\nWell yesterday my grandma, who has Christmas at her house every year, called me to tell me that the family was planning on celebrating the holiday a few days before it this year\u2026 On my birthday. I asked why that was the plan, and was told it was because my cousin, who is also pregnant and due about five months after me, can\u2019t make it to Christmas if it\u2019s on the actual day. I mentioned that we\u2019d never moved Christmas to my birthday before, and that I wasn\u2019t even sure how it would work? We don\u2019t usually get done with our holiday activities till around 8PM on a normal Christmas, so when would we even do anything for me.? She got upset and told me that plenty of people have their birthdays on holidays, and that it will be fine. I then told her I\u2019d already made plans with my husband for my birthday and I wasn\u2019t very keen on cancelling them, and she got very upset before hanging up. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I was in the wrong yesterday, I\u2019d already made plans for that day and they moved Christmas without checking if I did. But then I woke up this morning to messages from a few of my cousins getting upset with me for it, and now I\u2019m questioning myself. My husband says it was crappy for the family to do what they did and that we should have fun on that day, but I don\u2019t know. ",

She would like us to get back together, but there\u2019s a major obstacle for me: her drug use (which was already an issue when we were together because I was against it). She says it\u2019s something occasional (she tells me she\u2019s only used drugs twice in 9 months, even though she had taken Ritalin without medical prescription for several months, which is an amphetamine derivative, for a self-diagnosed ADHD), and she believes that my disagreement with it shows that I don\u2019t trust her to manage it, claiming it isn\u2019t a problem for her in terms of danger (immediate risks related to her use) or addiction. She sees my limit on this issue as a personal boundary of mine that shouldn\u2019t affect her. I know I\u2019m very rigid about this, but I can\u2019t see myself building something with someone who uses drugs, even occasionally. I would be too afraid that something could happen to her, and I sincerely believe it\u2019s not a healthy practice, which also reflects a deeper emotional struggle that she doesn\u2019t want to face, in addition to all the horrors that drug trafficking causes on a global scale (murders, prostitution, etc.).\n\nI would like your opinion\u2026 AITAH ?",

      "selftext": "I'm 30m, I've lost my mom (dad was never in my life) when I was 16 to suicide. We were devastated. My grandparents (76f and 78m) fully adopted me, we became really close. I love them dearly. My granddad is super chill and withdrawn, but because of that he is submissive to my grandma almost completely. My grandma on the other hand is very strong willed and emotional, even to the point of being emotionally manipulative (for example, she starts crying very easily if there is a disagreement, and takes advantage of it, she knows I can't handle her crying). I know she's hurt from losing her daughter and she's terrified of anything happening to me, but that control and manipulation with combination of depression , definitely screwed my late teens and early 20s, to the point of me having basically no social life. \n\nAt some point I've convinced them that I need to move out from them and have some boundaries. I have an apartment left from mom, so I moved out there and it's very close to them, so I could visit often. \nAt first it was like a breath of fresh air, I was still sort of financially dependent on them, while I was studying, but I felt like I took control of my life, but then they started visiting my home unannounced, even when I was not there (yes, they have a key to my apartment). They've justified their visits by bringing food and going through my stuff under the justification of helping me with cleaning. At first I didn't mind it, even though I didn't need such help, I humored them, after all, they were just trying to help. \nBut I got a strong feeling that they've just using that as an excuse to check if I'm not doing anything \"bad\". Grandma often commented and judged my eating habits and my house order. The feeling of being constantly monitored started to mentally drain me, so I've asked them to stop doing so, or at least ask me beforehand. They've agreed and that helped for couple of years,everything was great. \n\nNow I'm working and completely independent financially from them and grandma definitely feel like she lost control over my life, so she started visiting unannounced again, and when I am asking her why she's here, why didn't she called, she straight up says \"well I wanted to see you and how are your living conditions\". My grandad says he is against this, but doesn't want to upset her. I've tried calmly explaining to them that this very rude and very stressful that they show up when I am not expecting it, they don't understand it. Mind you they are almost 80,so them walking over to me is also not very safe, especially in the winter, I would much rather to visit them instead. They've fallen and hurted themselves multiple times, thankfully nothing serious.\n\n  So yesterday, I had a day off work, I was feeling lazy, I ordered some food and decided to leave most of my house chores for Sunday,I got a call from granddad saying that they are coming over. He thought calling 5 min before their visit was good enough. I was really upset when they came and didn't hide it, but then she started commenting on the state of my apartment and the fact that I was eating junk food. That really pissed me off, and I blew up at her. Told her that not going to let them in anymore and that I going to change my locks. She became really upset and stormed off, my grandad says she's been crying to a day now and doesn't want to talk to me. I'll be honest, I feel terrible that I've lost my temper with her, but I also feel like I'm in the right. I'm not a teenager anymore, I'm a grown ass man, even if they don't think so. I know she means well and she's just worried, but her actions are stressing me out. AITAH for being angry with her? I will most likely apologise either way, but I want to know if my anger is unreasonable all together. \n\nSorry for the long post, will probably delete it after a while. Just need some advice on how to handle my situation. ",

      "selftext": "I (18F) and my brother (19M) have always been extremely close and he would tell me anything and i\u2019d tell him anything, When we were 13yr and 12yr,  he came out to me as gay. I did not support it because our values and religious beliefs, that did lead me to telling our parents on accident once.  That did make our bond break and we stoped being as close as we were before.As we grew up, we all began to finally accept it and know he is still the same little boy as he was before. This lead to him introducing to his \u201cboyfriend\u201d( who i will call Joe), He was very attractive so I found it hard to believe he was gay, and at most would go for my brother instead of me (Only because he looked like the type to go for me). Joe later introduced me to the term \u201cBi\u201d, which means he liked males & females which did make me wonder if he would actually go for me if he was not with my brother. So I decided to text him asking about dinner plans with him and his \u201cboyfriend \u201c ( my brother) and that later led to us texting all day and all night which did excite me a bit but again he is my brothers \u201cboyfriend \u201c so I just let it go. But again, he kept texting me first and conversations kept  going on and on (which i did enjoy), and eventually i did end up catching strong feelings but i kept it to myself because again, he was with my brother who i wouldn\u2019t ever want to hurt. The day of the  dinner, he ended up sitting across from me and of course i got nervous and tried to dress a little more  special than i normally do. We end up making alot of eye contact. He was taller and stronger than anyone else there, so i asked him to help me set up the christmas lights outside because i needed a helping hand.  My brother offered to come and help too, but joe insisted that it should only be me and him and another person isn\u2019t needed at all. As we were setting up lights, we kept laughing and goofing around, and it turned to us getting really touchy and all of a sudden, Joe looks at me and HE made the first move. I was shocked at first but I gave in kissing him back. Luckily, nobody saw and we walked back into the house like normally. One kiss turned into daily secret hookups and i obviously felt very guilty , but again i cannot control how i feel and who i like. Me and joe started texting about how it would be better if we just were to date and tell my brother because keeping it a secret is cruel. A couple weeks pass, and Joe breaks up with my brother and i am the shoulder my brother cries on, Yes i felt bad but also i deserve to be just as happy as he was &  it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal because they had only been dating for a couple months. Some weeks past, I confessed to my brother I am the reason Joe broke up with him and we have been seeing eachother for a while ( i did not mention the first kiss). My brother went CRAZY, he started calling us names i don\u2019t want to repeat, saying we are \u201chorrible people\u201d. He yelled how he is ashamed he could ever trust me again and he regrets ever even getting close with me. He told my family members and they all saw me as a horrible sister, but they don\u2019t seem to understand you can\u2019t control who you like or who you are attracted too. AITA? ",

      "selftext": "Hi. I'm a 33F working as a server at a nicer kind of restaurant. \n\nI have only been with the place for going on 4mo. I left my former job that I was managing because it was a dead end job and I didn't have realistic promotional options nor means to increase my hourly salary outside of annual raises. In addition to it being a dead end opportunity, the upper management of this place frequently liked to change/break rules and labor laws. After 3 years of dealing with it because I felt like I had to, I finally left. \n\nI figured a serving job would be lucrative and less stressful than managing a large department but I have stumbled onto a barely functioning place and I feel like it's time to find a new job already. \n\nLong story short these owners are new and have no idea what it takes to run a restaurant. We run out of small wares menus and every kind of glass we have. They overbook parties and understaff the kitchen and when they get bad reviews they blame the front of house staff. Don't get me started on the bug problem. \n\nMy very first check with them did not come until the following Tuesday. I had no idea that I'd get my check late and neither did anyone else. They told us it was ADPs fault and everyday they said that our money would be there by end of day. I was told Sunday at the latest. The said they were dealing w ADP since Wednesday to \"resolve \" the problem and I asked why they didn't actually make us aware there was potentially a problem. I had gone home Thursday night and used my tip money to cover bills and figured the bills coming out over the weekend would be fine since I had a paycheck coming. As I said no one got paid til Tuesday. \n\nI told them then that this was incredibly inappropriate I've worked many jobs in two countries and adp has never failed. I knew they submitted late they just wouldn't admit it and were mad at me and others for being mad about not being paid. I worked my Friday Saturday and Sunday shifts and called in Monday Tuesday as I hadn't been paid yet. Wednesday when I came in was a bad shift as well as we ran out of everything from chicken to steaks and so much more. \n\nMonths later and this past Friday we woke up and there was nothing in our accounts yet again. Staff had told me last time that this had happened many times already (6+) and I was like absolutely not how do they get away with that. \n\nSo when we woke up unpaid I called the head office and left a voice mail and also emailed corporate about it. I then went to my Friday shift after stating I wasn't coming in. Our GM who is new convinced me to come in as he said he is doing all he can to look into things. The owners told him it was ADP again. I told him how things went last time. Needless today he wasn't happy. \n\nApparently the owners (25m,24f) were over heard discussing how they wanted to retaliate against me and cut my section, take shifts, etc. GM told him not to do anything because I was iin the right and the labor board would also think so. I come for my shift and GM cuts me a 4booth section and our 12person party room with two parties scheduled for the night. Gm asks me to put my best face forward and steer clear of them. I agree and said I would. Before my party was over I noticed someone greeting a table in my section. I checked the board and she cut my section by 2 booths. I have my second party in about 30 minutes so I think ok 2 booths and I can focus on my party. I bus the first and set the second one up all by myself in less than 30, scavenging for cutlery and menus since we are so short on them. I come around at 640, no party and menus taken. Host and GM are confused. The owner cut my section and took my second party away. I was furious. \n\nI asked GM to cut me shortly after (like 7pm) because I was not sticking around. \n\nOur regional manager called me on Friday and I was driving and unable to take the call. Since I decided to attend my shift I didn't call back until sat. I told him everything going on from the bug problems and their lies about ADP. Regional was able to confirm that payroll was sent late. I said they won't take responsibility and are mad at me for not wanting to punch a clock that doesn't pay me and this is the second time and employees (many bring students) have said it's happened more. They scale back out KMs hours in the system, take tipout for themselves and do not actually distribute tip out fairly to all the people entitled to it. They blame us everytime something goes wrong. I have tried to calmly discuss some issues with them, which they start talking over me, denying and going off and belittling me. And of course about her retaliating after being told not to.\n\nI took Saturday off because I am so anxious and upset I am throwing up. \n\nI have a double today and i am feeling my anxiety symptoms through the roof. I take medication for my anxiety as well. \n\nMy brain is attacking me saying I am a bad person for reporting everything and going in on them. I also want to go to the labor board after a conversation with the fm owner just basically going off on me when I told her I was taking Saturday as per my therapists guidance when my symptoms are getting bad. I told her that I spoke to RM so he knows why I was missing shift and I did so because I anticipate her retaliating and that was my way of telling her that i have already reached out to higher channels. \n\nAll the FOH staff agrees and has wanted to take some kind of action but feel they may lose their source of income in the process and being that the majority of them are literally college students, they don't really understand their rights and if we don't fight to have our paycheck on time ii don't know what the world's come to. \n\nThey paid us by Friday end of day but the last time, as I said, money came Tuesday and none of us believed that it would come through on Friday at all but I am not patting them on the back. We had 19 hours where we should have been paid and weren't and didn't know when we would for sure. They still paid us late. \n\nI just want the nagging \"YOUVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG'\" feeling to subside. \n\nSorry it's so long. ",

      "selftext": "This may be long one because of the years of issues. I've always felt like an outsider with them and never a part of. We've had issues with holidays in the past and always go see them even though we were super uncomfortable being around them. My older sister (34) always complains about my wife to her face and how she isn't being a good mother. For example, my wife and I have an arrangement that we made between ourselves, she works from home and takes care of our son all day while I'm at work, so if I'm around and we're away from home, I give my wife a break to take care of our son, none of this is my older sisters business.. well, one year she overheard my wife tell me that our son needs help changing his pants, so my sister snorted at her, \"ugh why don't you just change him!\"\n\nThat's just one example.\n\nNow, my wife and I are working on our mental wellbeing, especially after we found out our son has autism and cerebral palsy. We need to be 100% for him and each other. We both are in 12 steps programs where we were recommended to spend the holidays in a mutual territory like a restaurant, so that no one expects a prolonged visit and less likely to cause arguments. I myself don't want to be around people drinking a ton, so I asked them not to drink if possible. This sent my dad (60) and older sister into a rage where they both said a ton of hurtful things about myself and my wife. I took as well as I could but finally had enough.\n\nMy sister brought up a time we \"went on vacation \" and how disrespectful my wife was to her. I couldn't for the life me remember EVER going on vacation with them, because I absolutely refuse to go on vacation with my siblings since I was 14. This might be a me problem, but still it took a while to realize wtf she was talking about. It was my birthday party that my wife invited them to! Not a vacation! She couldn't even recognize that we rented a cabin for me and my birthday party!\n\nHere comes my perspective of that day. We planned a weekend where my wife surprised me with a family get together for my birthday. When we arrived my family was already there. I guess I should mention that I have a younger sister (26) younger brother (28) and another younger brother (30) my older sister being the oldest. All of them came out for the occasion of celebrating MY BIRTHDAY. At the time our son still slept in his pack and play, so we set up in the only room that fit the pack and play. But since my siblings got there before us, my older sister assumed the big bedroom would be for our parents, which I did assume to, but we had a baby that didn't fit in the only other available room. So, we took the big one that had a bathroom and door leading outside to the hot tub. My siblings we tubbing when we showed up, so when my older sister looked in and saw us taking the big room, she hopped out of the hot tub and walked into the room. The pack and play was blocking her way to the bathroom so she started yelling at us about how we should take the other bedroom.\n\nI told her that we didn't fit in it with our baby, and needed the room for him. And if she wanted to use the bathroom we didn't mind, just walk around the cabin because our son was napping in the pack and play. Instead she started kicking the pack and play, making my wife pick our son up while she's screaming at us for being selfish and not letting the rest of them use that bathroom, to which my wife said, \"we aren't saying you can't use the bathroom, just don't be lazy and go around the cabin to get back in\" which prompted my sister to scream at the top of her lungs, \"I'M NOT CRAZY\" And she started kicking again. I understand we could've picked our son up earlier and moved the pack and play for her, but neither of us wanted to wake our son.\n\nMind you, this was within the first 30 minutes of use being unpacked for the weekend. You can imagine how the rest of the time went. Let's just say it wasn't my best birthday.\n\nSo, after hearing how little they cared about my boundaries on what to do for the holidays, and my sister calling my birthday a \"vacation \" I had enough and blocked them all.\n\nI've heard about how they're all calling me a narcissist who needs therapy now and so I unblocked my mom. Now I feel so guilty about it all, but I'm just done. This has been the last straw.\n\nShould I have left them unblocked and AITAH for getting them out of my life",

      "selftext": "In the last few years my dad (53) has managed to make all three of his kids (including me) and my mom isolate him. i (24 F) pity him and feel torn because the whole house has become cold to him and honestly neither of my siblings or me want to take care of him when he gets old. Thats such a miserable life to lose all that you built up and I feel torn on if I should give up on him.\n\n-When my grandfather (mom side) passed away, not only did he not comfort my mom, my dad accuses her of taking over the funeral management and that she should listen to her brother more, saying \u201cjust because she has a degree she shouldn\u2019t assume she knows everything\u201d.\n\n-He made a joke in front of dinner guests about how \u201cthe dish is as tender as the eldest daughter\u2019s thigh\u201d (that would be me, i was creeped out because what a weird ass thing to say)\n\n-When he is with us, he scrolls all day on his phone. We don\u2019t entrust him to do grocery or dishwashing or cooking because he performs them so badly. My mom asks him to follow a recipe and he never does.\n\n-my youngest sister (15) usually criticizes him for driving too slow to school. So once on a highway he started speeding and swirling and made my mom and my youngest sister felt unsafe. They told him about this and he felt that he didnt do anything wrong. \n\n-he smokes and my youngest sister (15) really doesnt like that for the sake of his health, she has tried to get him to quit multiple times. He doesnt take her efforts seriously and thinks its funny.\n\n-recently did I find out he was also responsible for a huge debt from a bank loan and caused my aunt, who was his guarantor, to almost lose her entire pension. Not only did my dad never apologize for it, my aunt and him got into an argument in a car and he dropped her off in the middle of the road. \n\n-my aunt and my uncle took up equal parts in taking care of my grandfather (dad side), when my grandfather passed away, my dad presided (even though he rarely took up the caretaking) that only the brother should get all of the inheritance (even if it wasnt much). So my aunt didnt get anything. \n\n-He bought a whole new patch of property for himself to live in even though we do have a house 30 minutes drive away. The new property is a money sinkhole because its a bare farmland, he wont rent it out because his reasoning was that he wants to leave it for a \u201cgrand gallery for our artwork\u201d. None of us asked for it btw. He wants to leave the property to us but it literally loses more money than it earns. He is also looking at more houses and farmlands now to buy currently. \n\n-He is also really into AI, chatGPT, crypto, apple vision pro etc. If that gives some sense.\n\n-My mom has to take care of all his health insurance and basic calls because he doesn\u2019t speak English well and does not want to learn, even though he is the one trying to immigrate. He would answer important calls sometimes and hangs up pretending he knows what was said rather than ask for clarification. \n\n-I personally think my mom and dad should get divorced because they argue a lot and he honestly isnt contributing to the family on neither chores or finance atp. My mom already said to him that he can do whatever he want with his money but he cannot touch ours. My mom wont consider divorce (stigma ig) and she is still forgiving and hoping that he would change, despite the shit he says to her and constantly belittling her and making her feel dumb (she is the one with a degree in IT) \n\n-My dad also tried to pit my mom against us three. He said to her that when she gets old that none of the kids would ever care for both of them, that they are all each other has got. \n\nThe thing I dont understand is that he wasn\u2019t always this way. Even though he wasn\u2019t present much in earlier childhood due to overseas work, I felt like he was at least \u201cnormal\u201d before and I dont hold grudge for him for that. I also feel guilty because financially he and my mom did support all three of us all the way. Why is he kind of\u2026delusional???\n\nIdk, am i too harsh on him? It seems all the things i list are so case specific and maybe im being too petty?? Is this just a phase/midlife crisis?? I mean i wish he would hit the gym honestly and have a hobby or idk get invested in something but the only thing he ever follows through now is scrolling on his phone. \n\nTldr: dad buys property and wastes money, is sexist, on his phone all day, my mom takes care of him like a man child yet he belittles her. AITAH for not wanting to take of him when hes old and wanting to give up on him? \n",

      "selftext": "So basically, long story short I lied to my friend (which I totally own up to and know it was wrong and have apologized). There was this guy my friend was into in the friend group, originally it was just a crush and then it turned into an obsession that pretty much collapsed the friend group. There were multiple factors that led to all of us telling them not to get together but then they did and lied to us all about it. We were pretty hurt but it felt like we bounced back from it pretty well as friends. A month ago, I was struggling with a lot of substance abuse problems due to financial, academic, and familial stress. One night, I was very high and began contemplating if I had a problem or not (I did) but reached out to the guy my friend had a crush on because he too had/has a smoking problem. I began talking to him and asking if he thought I had a problem or not. He began to tell me that he didn't think I did, and about how amazing and beautiful he thought I was and essentially flirting with me. In my intoxicated and lonely state, I reciprocated the flirting and asked him to sleep with me (no pictures or anything was exchanged) I fell asleep and woke up the next morning flabbergasted by what I did. Immediately I texted him and told him I didn't mean any of it, that I was high and that I did not like him I was just lonely and he said all the right things. He texted back saying not to worry that he understood and that he was also high and didn't mean any of what he said. I did not and do not have any romantic or physical attraction to this guy at all, I was just greening out severely. I did not tell my friends because 1) I was embarrassed of my smoking habits and did not want to be seen as weak 2) I cleared it up immediately 3) I did not think it was a big deal because nothing at all happened. However, apparently this guy lied to my friends and told her I was sober and asked to hu on multiple occasions (I did not). She held it in for three weeks before confronting me about it with my other best friend at 1 am after I got home from work. This is where I know I'm the asshole, because I did lie and did say I didn't ask to hook up. There's no excuse for me lying, however I do want to emphasize that I was extremely exhausted from a long shift in retail, studying for finals, and trying to find time for my friends that day while also still fighting the urge to smoke until my brain felt like comfortable mush. They caught me in the lie and were rightfully upset and left, which I do not fault them for at all. However, later that night all of my other friends in the friend group began blocking me without warning. I am the type of person that needs to write down their feeling and journal to make sense of them all. So, I had written apology letters I planned to give to my best friends in the morning after the dust had settled. However, I opted to put them by their door that night because I did not want them to turn me into a social pariah without knowing my side of the story. This morning, I woke up to a knock on my door from someone they had sent to collect any item they had in my room (including a behavior chart that we made that I paid for the posterboard to make). I've tried to text them to ask to talk so I can explain that I didn't mean to hurt anyone and apologize for lying. However, no one is responding or even reading my messages. I think it's important to note that when the friend who was lying about hooking up with the male friend I high texted, my other friend and I were only upset for a few days and then we talked to her about it and everything was cleared up. We did not take our stuff from her room, we did not turn off our locations for her, and we did not pit the rest of the friend group against her and block her. However, they've done all this to me. I know I'm in the wrong for lying, however seeing as I cleared up and recounted my high texts with the boy and it did not lead to anything I didn't think it was a big deal and kept it to myself because I felt it would be blown out of proportion as it is now. What do I do? Am I really a terrible person for this? ",

      "selftext": "For content I (F30) am watching my dad\u2019s dog this weekend (a medium sized rescue) and my neighbor (M60s?) has a large retriever of some kind that he is unable to control. Beautiful dog but this dog has no training and is constantly roaming the grounds. \n\nSo yesterday morning I go to take my pup out (we\u2019ll call him Milo) and all of the sudden I see my neighbors dog running full sprint at me and Milo. My first reaction is to grab Milo and to protect him because I have no idea what this dog is going to do. As I\u2019m holding Milo it seems like the dog isn\u2019t aggressive so I turn around to see if my neighbor is out to get him and then I see he is unconscious on the ground. From what I can gather he took his dog out shortly after I did and since his dog has no training and he can\u2019t control him he took off after Milo knocked him down and he hit his head. (It\u2019s about 20\u00b0 F here in the morning and the ground is hard from being frozen) I throw Milo inside call for my boyfriend to come outside and call 911 and run over to make sure he\u2019s still breathing. He is. My boyfriend calls 911 and comes outside with me to wait. \nMy neighbor is unconscious for a GOOD 5+ minutes. When he starts to come to he is dazed and clearly doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. It takes him an another couple minutes to figure it out. My boyfriend and I explain what happened and that he was unconscious hit his head and help is on the way. \nWell he didn\u2019t like this. \nHe stands up and immediately falls over again. We run over to help and try to get him to stay on the ground so he doesn\u2019t hit his head again. This is where things go sideways. He stands up again wobbling and backs himself against his unit and turn\u2019s aggressive. Tells us to back the fuck off. He didn\u2019t ask for our help and he doesn\u2019t want our help. We obviously don\u2019t want an altercation so we put up or hands apologize and just say we didn\u2019t want to leave him unconscious in the cold and walk away. He goes inside and so do we. \nShortly after the ambulance fire department and police show up. \nI got outside and explain everything that happened and point out his unit. They thank me and say they\u2019ll take it from here. \nThey do eventually get inside. It took awhile for him to open the door and apparently he was so disoriented he did end up going to the hospital. \nI know medical bills are expensive but I just couldn\u2019t leave someone unconscious outside in the freezing cold. But he was definitely pissed I called 911. My boyfriend says I did the right thing but now I\u2019m concerned my neighbor is going to hold a grudge against me. So AITAH?\n\nEDIT: Small update. My neighbor just came over to talk to me. He just got home from spending the night in the hospital and he apologized for being aggressive and thanked me for calling 911. He has a severe concussion. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s ok and I\u2019m glad this came to a peaceful resolution. ",

      "selftext": "So here\u2019s some background: I (23, F) come from a family where my father is the sole earner. My father worked for the government and is now retired, and he has been funding almost everything for the family, including my older brother (34), who has been unemployed for his enitire life. My brother has made some really bad decisions in terms of his career and lifestyle, which have drained my father\u2019s retiremenet savings, and now my father is using his pension just to cover basic living expenses for my brother, his wife, and their kid, born recently. My brother hasn\u2019t contributed financially or emotionally, and my parents often feel let down by him.\n\nI\u2019m in my second year of an MBA, and the tuition fees were 21 lakhs. My father was happily ready to fund everything, but after observing all this and realizing that we're just one emergency away from getting into bad financial position, I took an 8-lakh loan to ease the burden on my father. It\u2019s been really difficult because I feel like I\u2019ve had to carry a lot of responsibility for myself, my education, and my family.\n\nI recently got an internship with BNY, which eventually turned into a full-time job at a low salary (8 LPA, against 11 average LPA in my college). The job is not intellectually stimulating, and I hate the work, but I took the offer because I was influenced by friends and bad job market. Now, I\u2019m stuck with this low salary, and I\u2019ll have to depend on my father for professional certifications like CFA/FRM to switch to better job/role/field, which cost a lot. I won't be able to fund it on my own due to low salary, loan EMI, etc. This would add to the financial burden on him, and I feel like his entire savings and pension are going toward funding my education and my brother\u2019s life, and it feels unfair.\n\nHere\u2019s the part where I feel conflicted: I resent my brother deeply. I feel like his decisions have made my life harder. If he had settled into a decent job years ago, my father wouldn\u2019t be in this financial bind. But now, at 34, my brother,(as well as his wife and the baby) is still dependent on my father, and I feel the pressure of having to make up for all the mistakes he\u2019s made. I feel like my brother is in this position because of his own choices\u2014he didn\u2019t make the right decisions, he didn\u2019t put in enough effort, and now my family and I have to deal with the consequences. I love my parents and would help them no matter what, but I would have much rather preferred it if i did it as a choice & not compulsion, I feel suffocated because I have to take on so much responsibility due to my brother\u2019s choices.\n\nEven though I may not have been perfect in everything I did, I\u2019ve always been able to do somewhat better than my peers. I could have done even better, but I know my own laziness and procrastination held me back. Still, I\u2019m in a position where I can sustain myself well, and I feel like I\u2019ve done better than my brother in that sense. I feel like I\u2019m expected to succeed in all areas of life\u2014professionally, financially, and emotionally\u2014just to make up for everything my brother hasn\u2019t done. This extra pressure weighs heavily on me because, had my brother done better for himself, I wouldn\u2019t have to shoulder so much. I did confront my brother about all this, and while I didn\u2019t scream or shout, there was evident, severe frustration in my tone. He got emotional, and I felt bad because I know he\u2019s had his struggles, but I also feel that he put himself in this situation and that he\u2019s had every chance to improve. I\u2019m left feeling like I have to do everything for the family, financially and emotionally, because my brother hasn\u2019t stepped up.\n\nSo, AITA for resenting my brother for his choices? Should I feel bad for being frustrated with him, or is my resentment justified?",

      "selftext": "I (30F) started working at a printing factory nearly 5 years ago. I started off as a 'helper' then slowly worked my way up into a Quality Auditor position on 3rd shift. I had never been happier. I loved what I did, working with books is my passion (slowly discovered this after struggling through art college and getting a useless degree in my area). I actually looked forward going into work, I volunteered for overtime often and took on extra projects without complaint. \nLast year the company sold, making it an 'employee owned' to a national printing franchise. They made major cuts quickly, over 60 people lost their jobs without notice, some there for over 35 years, many people jumped ship and found new jobs anyway.\nI was one of the lucky ones who made it through the cuts, two people in my department weren't so lucky. \n\nWe were told that the cuts were over and people were secure in their jobs. A year has passed since the cuts were made. They began rehiring people, filling in positions they deemed \"unnecessary\" at the time. Machine Operators were forced into helper roles. Getting paid 2x the amount of a regular helper for less work. \n\nAnyways, last Friday I got pulled into HR. They told me that after evaluation they deemed my position unnecessary. Quality runs on all shifts; It's not confined to 1st or 2nd only. \n\nAnd yet durring the quarterly meeting, they raved about how Quality is one of their main focuses for customers and they were 'excelling' at it?? \n\nTo say I was devastated was an understatement. I was ugly crying in front of the HR and Head Supervisor. They \"advocated\" for me to stay in the company, offering me machine operator positions for similar pay as to what I was making as an Auditor. They fed me the line of \"it's nothing personal, it's just business, but if they decide that 3rd shift is needed, you'llbe the first to know\".  \n\nWhich, in all fairness, I understand, but it also doesn't make sense. My job was more than pulling books and sending it out to customers. I pulled files, checked sections of books, put things on hold, brought problems to press and finishing. I took on the role of monitoring High security jobs/books with specific release dates, making spreadsheets and postings of said jobs for others to be informed. I was even in the process of learning how to make hand bound books so I could do MORE in the office, not just what the job description entailed. \n\nNow, I'm demoted to being a small Machine Operator, one that gets pulled from the machine to be a helper on other lines since they're still so short staffed. I basically lost my office job to go do grunt work. They also get mandated overtime, most often not to run machines but to work the lines as helpers, which I do NOT like at all. In a fit of anger, I applied to other jobs. Now, it's my first night back from being an Auditor to a machine operator (still need training). But I feel... guilty? That I want to leave. \n\nFive years of working a job I loved to repeat and have to start over. I swore I would to the bare minimum, just coast on by, head down until a better opportunity presented itself. I KNOW they'll still expect me to do Quality Auditor tasks, and my petty ass wants to respond \"that's not my job anymore, remember?\". \n\nI was loyal for those 5 years, advocating for the company when they hit hard times. But now? I couldn't care less. They made it clear that this is a job, one I'm easily replaceable at, not a life career like I hoped it could have been. My bf says they did me dirty and I should leave, but my loyal side hopes that it'll get better. \n\nShould I cut my losses and start over? Should I hang out and pray that they give me my position back after realizing Quality is nessessary on ALL shifts? I'm so torn. My pay is cut by $3, which doesn't seem like much, but it will effect my paycheck greatly in the future. ",

      "selftext": "Long story short about our background, a mutual introduced him and I about a year ago and we only made it official about two months ago. During that whole talking stage, we first established that we didn't want a relationship, but acknowledged a few months into the relationship that we were basically dating but still had some issues we needed to work out, which is why we hadn't made things official. However, earlier in March of this year, he ended up lying about romantically talking to two other girls and going on a date with one of them (who he told me not to worry about because he \"didn't find her pretty\") after we established exclusivity, where he then said he didn't think we should be exclusive unless we were dating. After that, things pretty much went back to normal between us but he wasn't treating me well (dismissive of my feelings, not communicating, etc) and by June, I attempted to end things with him due to a argument we had in which I voiced my opinion over something and he attempted to add some humor into the conversation to lighten the mood. Because he had a history of being dismissive of my feelings and with the way he had been treating me, I said I didn't want to pursue things and was under the impression that he wouldn't fight for it, but he did. I ended up asking for a break of about a week to decide if I wanted to continue things, and ended up wanting to in the end. About a month before this, I had also met a new guy from another mutual who I began talking to and hanging out with, and who I eventually slept with a few times. The first guy, let's call him James, ended up finding out and confronted me about it, to which I lied at first but ended up telling the truth as he had looked through my phone. He was hurt and the trust was broken, but we ended up deciding to date and work through everything that had happened. However, since we've been dating, he has not been loyal to my standards (liking girl's thirst traps, getting a girl's Instagram through a friend and telling the friend to not let her know he is taken, etc) and I don't know what to do anymore. I was upset with him earlier today and rejected his sexual advances, saying I didn't want to because he didn't know how to be loyal, and ever since then, he's been cold. I had always believed although I was wrong for lying, sleeping with the other guy wasn't as fucked up as him lying about the other girls SOLELY because we weren't exclusive, but this is the only issue we can't get past and I don't know how to work past it either.

      "selftext": "I\u2019ve often wondered if the twenty-year mark might be the right time to send a letter to my former professor, expressing how her actions impacted me and others as young students. I want to explain how her behavior, both what she did and failed to do, left lasting effects.\n\nTo provide context: this professor taught small, selective art classes at a university, with 5-10 students. Most of us entered with idealistic dreams of pursuing our art, but by the end of the course, she had dissuaded several talented students from continuing, even as a hobby. Her cruelty was not constructive; she mocked and belittled those she decided she disliked, targeting the most vulnerable and making the classroom a place of fear. I remember feeling physically ill with anxiety before class. Meanwhile, her favorites received constant praise, creating a dynamic of emotional dependence where they worshiped her approval, while the rest of us were left terrified.\n\nAfter being fired from that position, she led another program, only to be fired from that as well. I\u2019m not sure what happened to her after that, though I know she\u2019s been in a stable position for a few years now. I\u2019ve often wondered what was going on in her life at the time. I don\u2019t believe she was a fundamentally bad person. There are people who speak highly of her, especially regarding her advocacy work. Perhaps that\u2019s why I still feel it\u2019s important to tell her how her behavior had a profound, negative impact on some of her students. If she is in a better place now, hearing this directly from a former student might offer her an opportunity to reflect on that period of her life, either privately or publicly.\n\nHowever, I question if it\u2019s my place to bring this up. I was one of the few who recognized the toxicity of the classroom dynamic, went on to graduate school with a full scholarship, and had my art professionally recognized. I rarely think of her now, except in moments of reflection about the kind of behaviors I want to avoid. But still, I feel it\u2019s important for her to understand the lasting effect her actions had on us. Enough so that I am writing this.\n\nWIBTA if a sent an anonymous letter?",

A couple weeks ago, we were talking about dating and he told me that his parents wouldn't let him date all of high school. I told him that it was alright and that I still want to talk to him. These past few weeks have been really nice, but I don't know how to continue in the relationship, since I've never dated anyone and would really want him to be my first. I don't see myself having any other romantic relationships for a while after this one. I've gotten pretty attached to him, and he makes me super happy (although this situation has caused me a considerable amount of stress). I really don't want to lose him or make him feel uncomfortable, but at the same time I don't want to be a pseudo-girlfriend for the forseeable future. Because of this stress and my overthinking, I've been pretty distant from him while trying to figure things out. Last night, he asked me why I wasn't talking to him as much, and I told him that our situation was really hard for me because I want to do all the silly couple things that high schoolers do. He understood, and we decided to take a break from each other while I thought over the pros and cons of \"dating\" him. I feel pretty guilty for doing all this to him though because he didn't do anything wrong. Some of my friends were telling me that I was an asshole for telling him that I needed space because I like him and he likes me, and that taking a break is causing both of us a lot of hurt that could have been avoided.

      "selftext": "Okay, so this is my first post. I've been thinking about this for a few weeks now and I don't know who to ask or who to trust that information with, so why give it to the whole internet right ?\n\nFor context, I came out as bisexual a pretty long time ago and just recently finally came out as a lesbian. We've been best friends for 5 to 6 years, friends for even more.\n\nA few years ago, around 2019 or 2020, I was in an open heterosexual relationship and I wanted to experience intimacy with a woman so I thought why not ask my best friend. So I told her if she ever wanted to try it out, I was here. Nothing happened since she politely turned me down, and I never really thought about it again until this year.\n\nThe open relationship I was in at the time ended at the end of summer 2022, and she kindly offered that I stayed at her house, just to get back on my feet, find a new place since I was living with my ex. And that's what happened. Found a new place, got back on my feet, took me a few years but here we are.\n\nIn septembre of this year (2024) I broke up with the guy I'd been dating for 5 months by coming out as a lesbian. He was heartbroken, I was all over the place because I didn't know how the fuck I could've missed it. And then, something really weird started to happen. As you may have guessed, it involves my best friend.\n\nI came out to her and my inner circle, and from that precise moment, it's like something shifted inside me ? I started reassessing, reliving some of the things we've done together this year, things I hadn't thought much about but that came really clear to me as signs of me being kinda into her.\n\nFirst, we went out for her birthday and she reminded me about that time I asked her to get intimate years ago. I had completely forgotten - I know it seems far fetched but I swear, I regularly forget to EAT SO, not that far fetched for me. So I was a bit shoked and amused that she remembered and seemed to remember vivdly. Then, after another night out with colleagues of hers we went to get some food to go. My order came first, so I waited outside and when she came out, I swear there was a moment I thought she was going to straight up kiss me. She caught herself in the moment, we laughed it off, talked about how she couldn't handle beer. Then again, I didn't think much of it in the moment.\n\nThen there's the little pet names. She used to catch herself calling me love and all, saying she was sorry. Again, I made the reason to be because she spent a lot of time with her boyfriend - yea, I know, I'll get to that - that she just needed to adapt and she was just saying it out of habit. But then she stopped. Not calling me names, but apologizing and finding excuses.\n\nAlso, she told me a long time ago that when she was a teenager, she fell in love with another girl - online, they never met irl - but never told her. She never dated a woman and has claimed to be heterosexual ever since, though I vaguely remember one talk about how she might be bisexual, but she quickly went back to claiming she was 100% hetersexual. She sends me reels of women she finds hot, and crushes on some feminine characters in series of all sorts, and that's that.\n\nNOW, for the boyfriend part. They've been together for 2 years now, I practicaly pushed her into his arms, because I dated the guys for 3 months back in 2017 and she wasn't very comfortable with it. Since I didn't really care, and I thought it would be too bad for her to be missing out on something that could make her happy just because of that, I pushed her a bit.\n\nAnd now, whenever I think of this, or them together, I cringe. Whenever she mentions her \"lover\" I struggle to keep a straight face, and it feels like she's doing it to remind someone that she's in a relationship but lately I've been asking myself. If that's true, who's she reminding ? At the beginning of the month, we went to a concert together, her favorite band's concert. Her boyfriend was there and he acted like a complete asshole and it really pissed me off. To the point I wanted to fight him for almost ruining that moment for her.\n\nAnyways, ever since I came out (septembre 2024) I've been denying myself the truth, then started questionning the nature of my feelings for her, which brings us here because I'm pretty sure a best friend doesn't think \"you don't deserve her, if you can't treat her right then lemme do it, asshole\". Even though self-esteem and all makes me doubt I even deserve her but that's another conversation.\n\nSo I haven't been thinking of her sexually - I won't allow it, it wouldn't be respectful and I'm terrified honestly. That someone notices something and tells her, if she doesn't notice it first hand. Cause I think that my behavior might be starting to show signs of my big fat underlying secret. Last week we went grocerie shopping - we always go together - and there we a lot of people in the same aisle, we were kinda stuck together in a tight space between carts and stuff and I just witnessed myself putting a hand around her waist and pulling her close to me. It lasted for just a second and when I realized what I was doing, I immidiately let her go, played it cool, like it was a joke or something and got out of the spot soon as the space cleared.\n\nI'd been thinking I should keep this whole thing to myself cause I don't want to interfere with her current relationship, she deserves to be happy and I wouldn't wanna jeopardize that. Also because I obviously don't wanna ruin our relationship, and can't help but have a tiny bit of hope that she might be having feelings too. But another thought just flashed through my mind. What if hiding it from her and having those thoughts and feelings was just as bad as when you discover that a man you thought was a friend was actually trynna get you into bed all along ? \n\nShould I tell her ? Should I sit this one out and wait, keep my mouth shut see if my feelings even last ? I don't know what to do I'm fucking lost and I need yall to be honest.\n\nAm I the asshole for not telling her I am falling for her ?\n\nSorry for the long ass post.",

I eventually reached out to her and we've had good conversations in the beginning sporadically.\n\nI eventually asked her out and she said yes. But later due to work, she couldn't make it and said we'll plan in next month. But the thing is - I never asked her out again. Because i wanted to see how things pan out instead as it was too early and we barely knew much of each other.\n\nFast forward from there, i have noticed even though she was replying , she eventually took days at times to reply- so I made the stupid mistake of asking her on this behaviour. She said \"hey\" but I changed the subject thinking it may have been too uncomfortable for her.\nGoing forward , she became cold and distant - but it was subtle like if I talk to her , she would talk but cut ties and stop responding to me after few exchanges.\n\nSo i stopped pursuing her. Even when I met her in office for next 2 months, I didn't say anything. She seemed to notice it , and there were times in the last weeks where she would ask if I had lunch or not, (or) there was a time when she literally rotated her chair to follow my trail back to my seat as I wasn't even looking at her or talking to her for weeks by then. That day she made multiple attempts to look at me directly  , even when talking on phone.\n\nSo i thought , ehhh..you know. Let me see what happens - curiosity got the best of me so I texted her again. She seemed to change a bit, giving long responses and using sophisticated humour for few days. But it seems now that she again disappeared after i asked her a simple nonintrusive question on what she did that day.\n\nNow, at this point, I'm confused on whether to continue this or not - cause I'm not sure if she's interested or not - because when I pull away , she seems to not be very comfortable with it as you can see from her behaviour.\nSo what's up with this ?

I have told her that I don\u2019t want to talk much during free time. Now she keeps giving me silent treatment and gets mad about everything. And when she does text me she says fake things to get my attention like \u201cI\u2019m in the hospital\u201d or something else, often really serious stuff and I get worried easily. I have told her to stop that but no use. \n\nAlso for context I have always been a antisocial and introverted person. I like to be alone on my own time. ",

I was diagnosed at 20 because I grew up in a \u201cpray about it\u201d house. This man is very patient, kind, and has a heart of gold. He\u2019s a hard worker and a good provider. But, when he\u2019s home, all he wants is to play video games. He hates to help me clean and always asks me to cook. I love cooking for him and baking for him, but not every single day. He was raised in a house where the women did everything. So was I, but that was if the woman stayed home. We both work full time, but he gets paid more, so in his mind, he does more work. I don\u2019t mind doing the cleaning and cooking, but that means I should be getting more than 20 minutes of his attention everyday. He will come straight home and go straight to the computer and play for hours to \u201cdecompress\u201d, and I\u2019d understand if it was an hour or so and the rest of the time was spent with me. I go to bed early because I\u2019m up at like 3:30-4 for work. He knows all of this and sometimes tries, but he\u2019d always rather be playing games. We are a pretty open minded couple sexually, (we both watch porn), and I usually don\u2019t have issues with it. I am the jealous type and I do get insecure, especially when he\u2019s searching up and watching specific pornstars. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a me problem, but it hurts my feelings when he does it the morning after we\u2019ve had sex and I\u2019m at work. It makes me feel like I\u2019m not enough for him. There is so much more I could add for more context or whatever, but I\u2019m gonna end here for now. 24 F, 25 M. Been together for 2 years \nWhat do I do? How do I even approach this situation? ",

      "selftext": "I will add TW Abuse\n\nTo explain our situation: a year ago I gave birth to a beautiful baby. Ensued deep postpartum depression on my part. My husband is epileptic and had multiple seizures and panic attacks in that period of time. It was an extremely difficult period of our lives and still is in some ways. Some people helped and some others make it worse just by their presence; sadly, the great grandma is the later for us.\n\nShe lives on the same street as us. She tries to create relationships by buying stuff to people and then expecting them to do what she wants in return. She was abusive and dismissive of my husband when he was a child, eg. slapping him in the face, hitting him and saying \u00ab\u00a0why are you making me do this?\u00a0\u00bb. At one point he was living with her as an adult and he had a seizure after an argument and she said he was just having a fit. She as an estranged child and a lot of her own family members do not want contact with her. \n\nAfter I gave birth and I visited her with the baby, one of the first thing she told me was that I should work out to lose the baby weight. She said some weird stuff like she wanted to have my baby in her own belly and didn\u2019t want to give her back to us. She never asks questions to get to know you, she is always the victim, but also she is super generous with money and objects so in the outside she looks like a good hearted lady. That\u2019s the thing; we \u00ab\u00a0owe\u00a0\u00bb her a lot. There are a lot that I could add. \n\nSince that last visit in April, she hasn\u2019t seen me or my baby. It was hard for me to get out and she stressed me out. Also we spent the Summer in the country side. My husband is just starting to get better. We did see other family members and friends; it\u2019s simple the situation with her is weird. She never yelled at me personally but I know she used to trash talk me when I was dating my now husband. I guess she loves me and then hated me? \n\nAnyway I told myself it would be time to go visit, because I do feel guilty about it. But my husband basically had a panic attack at the idea of seeing her so I cancelled and now she is not answering my text. I feel like I\u2019m a bad person, because she is old and kind of lonely. \n\nSo am I the asshole?",

I'm the Marketing Manager at a restaurant, and I've been in charge of organizing a month-long meeting regarding a training for an upcoming Limited-Time Offer (LTO). I've been coordinating everything, ensuring the training process would be ready, and have been communicating with the team about the schedule, timing, and expectations.\n\nHowever, the Operations Manager made a last-minute change to the training that wasn't communicated to the team. Since no one was informed about it yet, I took it upon myself to suggest a new timing for the training to make sure things kept moving smoothly and to avoid any confusion.\n\nI was told that the Operations Manager will be communicating the updated details later today. While I understand they have the final say, I\u2019m feeling a bit frustrated because the lack of communication has created a bit of a hiccup in the process. I don\u2019t want to step on anyone\u2019s toes, but I also feel responsible for making sure the team is on the same page.\n\nHow would you handle this? Should I wait for the Operations Manager\u2019s communication or take a more proactive approach to ease the confusion? Any tips on managing this kind of situation?\n\nThanks!",

      "selftext": "Let me be clear, we aren\u2019t together anymore. My (33M) soon to be ex wife (28F) are going through divorce now. I\u2019ll just refer to her as S.\n\nShe has give me a lot of reasons why our marriage didn\u2019t work, but I\u2019m just asking if I\u2019m the AH about this specific thing. \n\nWhen we first started dating, I was pretty open about my past sexual history and would test the waters about what I could say in front of her. Most of my ex gfs were pretty open to me saying things about other women, so I was surprised when S expressed to me like a year into our relationship that she didn\u2019t like it. \n\nShe says these examples ruined her self esteem: \n\nShe asked me once what my favorite porn was, so I showed her a video of this girl (my favorite p*** star) getting herself off. She asked me why it was my favorite, I told her pretty bluntly that the girl has a perfect physique and I find her facial expressions and ability to squirt extremely sexy. S said that this was the moment she felt not okay with me looking at p*** anymore, which felt extremely unfair because she\u2019s the one who asked me. She told me that when she asked me, she didn\u2019t expect I was going to show her and thought I would just tell her like a genre or maybe something I would like to try. I guess I misunderstood and have apologized for this. She said she feels bad because she looks nothing like this performer, I told her she doesn\u2019t need to look like her but I do also like to look at this performer because she\u2019s extremely attractive. \n\nNext example is just sharing past details. She asked me once what the best sex I ever had was, and I told her it was this one time with my ex. She got extremely upset and said that she asked what OUR best sex was, but that isn\u2019t what I heard. I apologized and told her it was only because my ex knew how to squirt and I had never been with someone who could do that. She felt super self conscious after this because she does not squirt, and I\u2019ve asked her on multiple occasions to try it and she wasn\u2019t able to. Which I\u2019m fine with, obviously. I even told her it doesn\u2019t mean anything and that I still enjoy sex perfectly fine with her.\n\nThe last straw for her was when we were watching a movie and I saw the actress and said \u201cshe has literally the best boobs.\u201d and then S wouldn\u2019t let me see her without a shirt on for weeks. And after that, I kept all of my comments about other women to myself once I realized how truly insecure S is. I have apologized and told her that it doesn\u2019t mean anything about her and that she needs to work on her self image. But when she wanted to divorce me, she said these were part of the reason. Things I said over 2 years ago and have since stopped saying. \n\nWe\u2019ve had mature conversations about attraction to others, sure. But I have been much more filtered and have explained that I\u2019m just a guy and that I like women, but that nothing compares to the mother of my child. It feels like she defines me by these comments I made and have apologized for. \n\nObviously they were tasteless and I should not have said them, but she actually let this be a determining factor of ending our marriage and that is just bizarre to me considering it was so long ago and I have since changed and have been a much better partner. She is still to this day the most attractive woman to me and she doesn\u2019t believe it.\n\nSo am AITAH for comments I made years ago that she most times ASKED for and that I have since apologized for? Did I rightfully ruin her self esteem? Or is she just an insecure woman who needs therapy? ",

I was really confused and shocked because we were literally just comforting Emily and didn't even let her finish what she was saying. Max was crying fake crocodile tears and everyone was so sad for him. I decided to say something and said that we were literally just comforting Emily and she wasn't even finished talking.

I had nightmares sleeping next to these men I was in relationships with, this man..he was the complete opposite.\nVery physically affectionate like I couldn't even cook without him wanting to hug me and now nothing.. I found out why and I need advice..\n(I admit I was dumb staying in those situations but it's life and I believe I've grown.)\n\nI worked 3 jobs originally total of (90/100 hours) this is while we were just talking and starting the relationship \n\nA\u2022 Monday, Wednesday and Friday was one job a total of 12 hours \n\nB\u2022 Tuesday to Friday I could work a total 40 to 70 hours. \n\nC\u2022 Tuesday,Thursday,Friday and Saturdays at another for a max of 30 hours \n \nWhen we started officially dating he made it clear he wasn't comfortable with one of these jobs and out of respect I let it go.. it was the one with most hours and also sadly the most pay so my finances took a heavy hit.\n\nI grew stressed my weight fluctuated and i worked very hard to get the body i have now.(400 lbs to 140) \nEven with that job gone i still took Uber's to and from his place total of almost 180$ every weekend and in our almost exactly 12 month relationship he's picked me up probably 8 times and even after we spoke on it and he said he'd pick me up sometimes..\nIt hasn't changed (been 4 months). \nOne of the other jobs refused my pay increase so I went & looked for another job, during that time again I got stressed and vented alot to my bf. I didn't know at the time but I annoyed him enough for him to go on his boys chat and tell me about how I'm complaining all the time. I was hurt when I saw the text, he saw I was hurt too and apologized and it was never about him venting to them it's the fact I annoyed him enough to tell other people about  it. Had nothing to do with him but me feeling bad, I disrupted his peace and those of his friends. I put it all to the side but didn't notice that he started distancing himself from then.\n\nFew weeks after another broken promise of him picking me up or even dropping me off I grew annoyed especially when he cracked a beer at 8am after swearing he would take me home.. again.. I had given up a job for him my finances were hit and with barely enough money for my 800$ rent I was stuck. He knew this, it sucked cause I had to borrow money not only from him but my family as well so I could maintain our relationship cause he wouldn't make the effort to come get me.\n\nI'm the type of girlfriend who won't ask for anything from their boyfriends if I know they don't want to do something but as I don't ask often the few times I do I would've hoped he'd make the effort for me. I cook for him almost every weekend, when I get to his house Saturday after ive worked I'll do his bed clean dishes in the sink be it his or the person he lives with, I often help clean his clothes from the washer. Basically I help him out cause he does do it himself. (We don't live together) \n\nAfter a while I got a job, left the one that denied my pay raise and then it started going okay again, new job accused me of stealing after 2 and a half months due to inventory issues and i had some things that the inventory was missing lost the job and now it was worse cause i had the job that paid the least and almost no hours so im back to being stressed and loosing money nonstop cause he wont pick me up but would rather put money we need to safe to move in together on the Uber instead of making an effort...still let it go.\nHis back was hurting so there still wasn't any sexual activity but I understood why.\nOctober comes around and it's my nephews birthday, I asked him to come to the party even for two hours and I'd pay his Uber he said yes..guess who didn't come and instead of calling me to tell me, he texted me and then called to ask if I was mad..the day of he basically ditched me..my own bf \n\nWe got into a fight and I brought up how im hurt i disrupted his peace and how he doesnt keep his word and it's hurting cause I'm feeling used and pushed aside. Again we haven't had actual sex at that point in a while and he keeps forgetting to kiss me and hug me. But at 3am he has no issue waking me up to give him a hjob and a Bjob. \n\nHe apologized for speaking to his friends and saying I complained when that wasn't the issue i just felt bad i disturbed his peace.\nHe said he'd try to do better\nStill a month & a half has passed, he still hasn't picked me up or dropped me off after promising me (since October were now in december still nothing) \n\nI had been planning on getting a boob job and a butt job he knows and has commented how he likes big boobs and a big butt..he even accidentally sent me a video of girls with a huge rack and it was \"supposed to be for his boy\" but still..why do you have that on your feed if you haven't like it before or something simillar?\n I have a B cup..and I have no butt.. so that makes me feel more insecure. He called me and asked \"when you get it done what are you planning on the size\" I replied a c or d I want fake but still natural. His reply was \"get a d so I have something to actually grab\". I replied \"not like you grab anything  now\" (i get it was petty but im frustrated & lonely in a relationship i dont get that when it wasnt like this) I got sad and insecure, my safe space makes me feel insecure. \nDuring our fight he told me clearly, the reason he hasn't touched me is cause I'm complaining and bitching and it's unpleasant so I have to be pleasant to have him love me.\n\nI feel used cause he's been unhappy these last months yet again will wake me up at 3 am for his sexual gratification. He even said I'm like his ex cause there always something, how can I be pleasant when you don't keep your promises. He gets stressed easy and I'm always there, when I am. I feel like I have to be alone cause it becomes about him and his feelings but he doesn't seem to care for mine \nI'm hurt \nMy safe space is gone and it seems like my person too. I feel like a place holder until he gets something better and it's not fair.\n\nWhat can I do? ",

      "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years, (F33, M34) we are young professionals and have no children. The past 4 years have been wonderful. We have grown in our careers and cheered one another one in our success. We complement each other so well and I just know he is my person. \n\nLast christmas I thought he was going to propose... Christmas is my favorite time of the year, our home is beautiful, its snowing outside its just perfect. We were opening gifts just the two of us (we already spent time with both sides of the family) last year, had the fireplace on and just enjoying the season and he says\" I think Santa left you something else...\" he goes to the guest bedroom and come out with one last gift. It was large but maybe just maybe this was going to be the moment he pops the question. It was not a ring, it was a pair for shoes. I was devastated that I even assumed that. I felt humiliated. \n\nAfter new years I sat him down and explained from my perspective how I perceived the gift. He completely understand and apologized. \n\nWe have talked about a ring, what we like, dont like, we have talked about a weeding, or getting eloped, I have focused on wanting to know what does he want because a wedding is the joining of two people, not just what I want. We have had some fantastic conversation about what we both want and have narrowed it down to two options. \n\nWe have even looked at rings, and I found the one that is perfect. \n\nFast forward to this year... I know for a fact he has not purchased many gifts as im the one getting them off the front porch and leaving anything addressed to him in his office. So my mind begins to wonder will he actually propose this year!? Then reality sets in and says no, he has this imaginary number in his head that he wants in his bank account and wants a job promotion before he proposes. Which is fine we have conquered paying off debt and saving for things and im happy to help him with this but I feel like he is making excuses. Which makes me feel like he dosent see value in this relationship. \n\nI am a very much if he wanted he would... and it is getting to the point where this is embarrassing. We are a older couple, corporate professionals, no children... I feel like he is questioning this relationship... which we are 4 years in... \n\nFor context we talked about marriage very ealry on in our relationship. I also set the president that im not dating to date/hook up im dating to find someone who wants to get married and do life together. \n\nFor some reason I thought maybe this year, we have conquered some financial goals, grown closer but no...He askes me \"I dont really know what you want for Christmas... how about I buy you a new garage refrigerator...\" To that I said no thank you, I would prefer a engagement ring. \n\nWhy would he want to buy me a garage refrigerator but not a engagement ring. Then when I say I would prefer a engagement ring he acts shocked like this is news to him. \n\nNow he dosent put alot of effort into gifts, he puts his efforts in other areas of our lives. I adore gift giving and try my hardest to find special gifts that you would never buy nor know you needed till I got them for you. \n\nI was crushed when he made that comment. It reminded me he dosent think about our future and what am I doing. I am with a man, playing house with someone who will not propose. \n\nFor context I am not even asking for a dimond (thats another discussion, it has to do with ethics for me) The ring we picked out we could pay cash for and that was intentionally done because I dont need a big flashy, expensive ring. \n\nAITAH for being hurt that he wanted to get me a refrigerator and that I want to marry this man yet year after year I mitigate questions from my family and his \"why has he not proposed yet....\" it makes me feel like  he is not prioritizing saving money for the ring, because anytime I bring it up he is shocked I feel this way. \n\nHelp and advice welome\n\n",

I told my dad about inviting them and he was hesitant because my nephew wouldn\u2019t be able to sit still. I told my mom that she can ask if they want to go but don\u2019t make them go if they don\u2019t want to. Now I\u2019m in a dilemma because I don\u2019t exactly want to invite them.\n\nMy nephew can\u2019t sit still. We just saw a movie recently and he was bouncing in his seat constantly.

      "selftext": "So long story I've been friends with my friend \"Sally\" since we were about 8. we are both in our late 30s now. When we were kids and teenagers she was not very nice at times. Emotionally manipulative, made friends with people I was originally friends with and left me out that sort of things.\n\nThings got better when we were adults and she has been very supportive of me at times and has given me a lot of support. She moved back to the area where we both grew up and we started hanging out alot. We would usually catch up once or twice a week and we have a group chat with another friend of ours that we would all chat in most days. \n\nA few months ago she got a job which keeps her very busy and makes her tired so I haven't seen her in about 2 months. I understand she is tired but she has also stopped chatting in our group. She will see the messages but not say anything. This always makes me feel like I might have said something wrong. When we invite her to do stuff she doesn't reply or when she does she comes up with a lame excuse not to come. When she does talk it's pretty much always about herself. \n\nI invited her to a party and I had to ask her 3 times if she was coming before she answered. The day of the party she said she was sick and would see how she felt. I asked her if she was feeling better and she never replied so I never actually got a reply as to whether she was coming or not. When I do try to make conversation with her or reach out she talks about herself or doesn't reply after awhile.\n\nMy question is am I being dramatic and over thinking or is she a bad friend and I should let the friendship go? What would you do?\n\nThanks for reading",

      "selftext": "TL:DR \nMy brother and SIL are bad at gift giving. It bothers me, I tried to make this Christmas a kids only gifts. I'm the bad guy.\n\nI(40m) get it I'm not the nicest guy in the world, I doubt I ever will be but I do try. \n\nBackstory: my child hood was rough and involved things that could get people locked up even today. I won't go into what as it could trigger people, this is important to know. I was usually left with gifts that meant little or nothing to me and definitely not what I asked for. My brother on the other hand wanted for nothing. As an example: one year he got a full stereo deck, probably 700-800 dollars worth. I was given a telescope, probably 50 to 60 dollars, and had no interest in space at all. We were both in our late teens at the time. \n\nAlso my SIL is not very loved by my family, she usually will not even be around us when the opportunity arises. Mouths off and insults people regularly. \n\nFast forward to this year. I turn 40 only one who even bothers to care is my wife. Fine by me, but I instead blow family off so I can spend time with her and our daughter. They get mad and say I'm causing issues because everyone wants to see us. My father plans a huge surprise party for his girlfriend, doesn't even wish me a happy birthday, brother plans big football watch party, both times I  just blow them off, no real excuses. \n\nI learn the lesson that people see you as the enemy when you advocate for yourself.\n\nI did get a gift card to a movie theater from my brother, which I don't go to the movies. I've been less than 5 times since I've been an adult. I just don't go. The card was handed to me with the line \"we tried our best.\" This is a standard practice with him and my SIL. I usually get a mug(i don't drink coffee or tea) or a gift for my daughter. The irrelevant gifts piss me off. \n\nWhy? Because they can't even spend the energy/time to send a text and ask anyone what I may want. It makes me feel like I don't even have enough worth to get to know me at all. Either I'm a piece of trash or they hate me, is how I see it. \n\nHave I said that Outlook? Not to them, there'd be questions and I'd rather not have to explain the BS I dealt with as a kid. Not to mention my brother thinks the world of the one that did the bad stuff. It's just easier to shoulder it myself. \n\nSo why is all this important? I suggested we go \"no gifts between adults.\" Just get the kids stuff. I pitched it as cheaper and easier, less stress less fuss. I was confronted by my SIL openly at their eldest's tenth birthday party, and rather publicly, I'll add. \n\nI was told that my SIL loves to figure out what to get people and spends a lot of time on it. I responded with \"I've had to institute a mug in mug out policy in my house because of the number of mugs coming in.\" Yes I actually said it. \n\nAll of it comes down to now they are wanting to do a secret Santa and I'm the bad guy ruining Christmas for my SIL. \n\nI dont care about how expensive a gift is. 5 dollars or 500 doesn't mean anything to me, but taking the time to make it good is important. I've got a marshmallow roaster that probably cost someone 5 dollars. It looks like a fishing pole and even turns with the reel. The thing has a dedicated space on my mantle. \n\nSo am I the bad guy here? Really I want to know.",

      "selftext": "For context, my friends and I have been chained to a cave wall since we were born, and so whatever we saw we assumed were reality. \n\nSo we were just looking at the shadows on the wall just like any other day, but today I noticed one of my shackles were loose.

So here I am, discovering a new world of real stuff.\n\nAfter a while I go back to my cave to tell my buddies what I saw.

One of them, let's call him Agathangelos, says that the outside haas left me an idiot.\n\nObviously, being a person with a sense of pride, I told him that he was foolish and that he needs to see the light. As I tried to remove his shackles, he kicked me in the shin, saying he didn't want to become a blithering idiot like me. So I left the cave, cursing them to an eternity of darkness.\n\nDid I go too far?",

      "selftext": "I (18f) moved out of my mom and her husband's house a couple of days after my birthday. It was something I heavily considered for a while but the push came because of the disagreements we had for years were getting worse and it was pointed out I lived in their home without paying the bills, etc. So I spoke to my grandparents and we agreed that it would be better for everyone if I lived with them. They came and helped me pack up my stuff, I took all my important documents and I left. My mom didn't believe it at first and tried to talk me out of it. She said I need to at least finish high school living with them but I said no.\n\nMy reason for moving out stems from the history with my mom since she remarried and her husband. My mom raised me mostly alone for 12 years. My dad died when I was only 7 months old. Even though I don't remember him and he was gone a long time I grew up with photos of him in our home and hearing stories and connecting with my family on his side. So I always felt a connection and I was always protective of he is my dad even if he died before I could remember him. Mom always said nothing could stop him being my dad. And that she believed he was looking over me.\n\nThings changed when she got remarried. It went from dad will always be my dad to hello, new dad for you here. Mom called him my new dad and he told me he couldn't wait to be my dad. I said I didn't want that. It led to fighting and he was hurt because \"you don't even know your dad and you have no memories of him so why reject me for someone you'll never know\". While mom told me I needed a dad. That she was sorry she hadn't seen it sooner. Dumb and weird stuff to ask a 12 year old was asked. Like who would walk me down the aisle if I didn't have a dad... my answer was mom but they acted like omg that's so dumb. Mom asked me who'd look after me if she died and I told her I had family. I also told her I wouldn't let him look after me if she died. That of course also hurt his feelings because he said I should stay with a parent over extended family. \n\nThen my name became an issue. They wanted me to change my last name to his. Mom actually put a petition in to change it in court but the judge let me keep my last name because I asked to. They also looked at having him adopt me but they were told my lack of consent would be the end of it. And I was very clear I did not want to be adopted by him.\n\nThey had us in therapy for 2.5 years. They would bring up my name a lot. That ended up being more of a fight than me not letting him be my new dad. They said I should be proud to have his name, that it was important to him, that it showed the world we were a family. It was tedious and never let up. The household became more unhappy until it reached the point of a heaviness staying over us. Sometimes I tried to ignore when they'd bring it up but they told me I was rude. My mom even tried to write my name as her husband's a few times and fucked some things up by doing that. She registered me for dance classes under her husband's name and when I had to bring in documents it became a huge ordeal. I didn't even wanna do dance but it was so embarrassing having my name become such a big deal.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant. Living with my grandparents has been SO good. But my mom and her husband want me \"home\" as they say, but I don't call it home. The house they live in never felt like home to me. And when my mom brought it up again a couple of days ago I told her I don't want to move back in and I never want to move back in. I said I would not be happy with them. She told me I belonged \"with my parents\" and she cried that I had left without even discussing it first. AITA?",

I used to work at a daycare and I adored this job. I always looked for the good in each kid and went out of my way to know things about each of the kids to establish a relationship. \n\nI noticed that one of the kids had been really struggling. He is a super smart kid but there have been constant behavior issues stemming from not listening. He would be all over the place running around and constantly play fighting with other kids. He wasn\u2019t being mean he was trying to play but a lot of kids got hurt. When we tried to talk to him about his behavior he would completely check out. I know most kids do but this was like he couldn\u2019t pay attention. It wasn\u2019t the only time there were several times mid conversation he would be completely distracted. To be fair he was 5, but it seemed to be more of an issue for him then the other 5 year olds. \n\nFor other context I have adhd and so does my fianc\u00e9. We were both diagnosed later in life and we both have the sentiment that we WISH someone had caught it or said something because it is so much harder finding out as an adult. There is a huge possibility that our own 4 year old has it as well so we have been paying attention to the signs that younger children exhibit and we are pretty sure he might as well. The point being if his teacher told us he should be evaluated I wouldn\u2019t even blink. I do understand that I am more prepared for this then someone who doesn\u2019t know adhd runs in their family but I\u2019ve always struggled with people that don\u2019t accept problems with their \u201cperfect\u201d kids. (Also I don\u2019t think adhd means anyone is less then it\u2019s just a different neuro type)\n\nKnowing all of this I decided to ask the parent about her son. I\u2019ve never been the best at reading social situations and decided to approach as directly and gently as I could. My exact wording was \u201chey, (to catch her attention) has kid been evaluated for adhd? I only ask because when we are talking to him it seems like he has a really hard time paying attention and I don\u2019t think he is doing it on purpose. He is a good kid and I just think he might be struggling.\u201d\n\nShe then glanced at a little list we have to get the kids to behave (this was not my idea but I have to follow the bosses ideas) that was the naughty and nice list. The kid in question was on the naughty list (he wasn\u2019t the only one on naughty) and in a rush I told her that he had started a lot of fights today. I didn\u2019t want her to think he was on the naughty list because of possible attention issues. I admit I said this part to hastily and without enough care but I was incredibly anxious about asking about adhd. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to leave things on a sour note so I mentioned how smart I thought he was and that he was a good kid. And she even seemed ok saying sometimes I think he is to smart for his own good. I thought everything was fine but it wasn\u2019t. \n\nThe next day she complained to the big boss over my boss (we were a daycare for employees) and I was fired that day. They said parents shouldn\u2019t have to know bad things and to lie if I have too. And that I wasn\u2019t licensed to diagnose so I should have said nothing. (I wasn\u2019t trying to diagnose and if he did have adhd and she didn\u2019t want to tell me I wouldn\u2019t have pressed). It feels awful and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. I just wanted to help because I didn\u2019t want the same thing to happen to him that happened to my fianc\u00e9 and I. And yes things could change because of young he is but it was more to put it on the parents radar. I wasn\u2019t trying to say the kid was bad or dumb. \n\nSo Am I The Asshole? Or was this situation blown out of proportion? What are your opinions? ",

Okay so, Ve went out with some friends and we had a couple of drinks and it was a fun night out but i would like to add this was on he anniversary of his death so i wanted to get her mind off fit and let her have some fun for once so it's not all she would think about, id like to mention I do pretty well with drinking but she really hates when i do drink so i try not to do it much infront of her but this night i really wanted to relive some stress and have a fun time with my friends. I had a couple of shots and she was already getting irritated because I did have to drive back home but i kept reminding her i will be fine and i will not get drunk. Again, we were out with friends so of course we played drinking games and i did get a bit tipsy to which really angered her. She straight up told me \"Can you please stop drinking because you are my ride home? i'd understand if you weren't but you are and i feel uncomfortable\", that obviously angered me because if it was so serious she could of took a uber or asked someone else to take her so i responded with \" I am not going to stop drinking and enjoying this night because you are overreacting about some drinks, just because your friend passed away and now you are always ruining fun because of something that happened in the past\". That made her extremely upset so she rolled her eyes at me and got into a mood (over a small comment, that i did not mean in a rude way) and requested i took her home because this night did not distract her nor did she have any fun. She was making me very upset because she was ruining everybody's fun and being a buzzkill so i responded with \" No you can get a ride home, please stop bothering me\" , she than proceeded to\nsay \" You are being very selfish right now\" and stormed ot of the place, which is crazy because i am nowhere near\n\"selfish\" i've always been there for her.",

My older sister (41) and her husband are pretty conservative, and I\u2019ve had some issues in the past with them about my being queer. They have four children, and it\u2019s been really hard to keep connecting with them as they grow up because I can\u2019t be honest about who I am. I\u2019ve asked my sister to tell them I\u2019m gay, and her response was \u201cmaybe. I just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s appropriate\u2026\u201d \n\nLast Christmas, I hand made all of the gifts for her kids, and they were addressed from both myself and my partner. My sister made it a point to only mention me. \n\nWhen I called to tell her my boyfriend proposed, she was in the car with her kids. I was trying to be respectful, so told her to call me back when she was alone. She did, I told her my good news, and there was no congratulations, just a \u201cyou must be so happy\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to be a good sport, just brush it off, but here\u2019s the kicker. \n\nMy mom and dad want to throw us an Engagement Party when we visit for the Holidays, and my oldest sister has yet to respond to her invitation. My mom told her about it weeks before the evites were sent, she\u2019s even opened hers, but she hasn\u2019t responded. I told my mom that if she and her husband choose not to come to the party, to me that says they won\u2019t come to the wedding either.  And that\u2019s a huge deal for me. I\u2019ve been there for every baptism, given presents for every birthday and Christmas, donated to fundraisers and more. If they cannot be there for me, then I\u2019m done. \n\nI haven\u2019t pulled the plug on our relationship before because I don\u2019t want to lose access to my nieces and nephew, but at some point, I have to respect myself enough to be done with them. I know if I cut them off, my sister will twist it to me being intolerant of their beliefs, etc.\n\nAm I the asshole here?

So my wife Anna (fake name) F35 and I have been married for 12 years, and we have three kids aged F11, M10, and M8. Recently, I decided to surprise her by redecorating our living room while she was away on a business trip. I spent a lot of time and money picking out new furniture, painting the walls, and even getting some custom artwork. When she came back, instead of being happy, she was furious. She said I completely ignored her taste and made the room look like a bachelor pad. I thought I was doing something nice, but now she's making me feel like I ruined everything.\n\nHere's the kicker: whenever I've gone on business trips in the past, I've come home to find that she's redecorated or repainted parts of the house. I work in finance, and she's an interior decorator, so I get that she has a professional eye for this stuff. But come on, she married me, so she must think I have good taste too, right? My parents are on my side, saying that I should have some control over what our house looks like. Honestly, I think she's overreacting.\n\nI might be the asshole because I redecorated our living room without consulting Anna, but I also think that I should be able to have a say in what my own home looks like.\n\nMy oldest daughter told me not to post about this since I tend to Reddit often, but I need to prove to my wife that I'm right. She obviously doesn't trust my judgment apparently. Maybe marriage counseling? She's mentioned it before, it could be a good idea I guess.\n\nAITA for trying to surprise my wife with a redecorated living room? ",

(Which is why i thought it wasn\u2019t a big deal), we both had trouble getting tickets when they first were on sale so we ended up buying tickets a little later. Which the total cost ended up being $1500 (which she paid for and i was very thankful) She sent me the money but the tickets were on my account so whenever it was time i could send her the information to get in the concert. A while back she asked me to give her back half the money because she said it would be only fair if i gave her back half just so we could be even, i was very confused because if she wanted the money back she should\u2019ve mentioned it when she was first buying the tickets because i did not have the money and i still do not. This led to a huge blowout argument between me and her and considering the fact that we were not on speaking terms i was not going to go to a concert with someone who i\u2019m on bad terms with and also had no contact with, a couple years ago her mother passed away which really affected her and i was there for her through it all. She happens to have a younger sister who wasn\u2019t as close with her mother than she was and wasn\u2019t really affected by her mother\u2019s passing, which cause them to have problems and eventually grow apart. I still kept in contact with her sister because I was very close with her entire family considering the fact i\u2019ve known them for all my teenage years, I called her sister and asked her if she wanted to go with me to the concert because me and her sister were not on speaking terms. (her sister also being a huge fan of t swift) As one would her sister agreed to go with me, The day of the concert her sister found out i was taking her instead and had a big blowout. Calling us both and calling us every vile name you could think of. I personally don\u2019t think it was really necessary for her to get heated up like that because we were in no contact whatsoever, plus the tickets were on my account which means they were my tickets.

My mom has a lot of health problem like COPD,  dementia, bed ridden, heart failure,  kidney disease. Just to mention a few. After moving closer to me and my adult children over a year ago my mom fell ill. We found out that she was pretty abusive to him. We knew she was verbally mean but didn't realize it was physical. I had offered him many times to just drop her off at my house and \"just run and never look back.\" He was always and good guy (so we thought). I told him he had put so much of his life on hold taking care of her and my grandmother. He's still young go live your life find a girlfriend and enjoy yourself. He won't he's not like that. Recently we found out he's been doing some real shady things. He's been spending her money and not paying her hospital bills. She used to pay all the bills. He's not the brightest crayon in the box. We have offered to help him get set up and show him how to do all that. He declined said he'd do it. His way was putting his account in the negative over $500 with autopays. He brings home about 4 k a month. He stays in our secondary home and pays a cheap amount of rent and his car payment. We pay all the utilities. He claims he's broke all the time. How no clue. He canceled one of her life insurance policies I'm pretty sure illegally allegedly. I'm investigating that. We are pretty sure he's putting away his checks because we feel once she passes he's going to move back home. Why wait? Go now. Home health nurse talked with us about putting my mom on hospice. We all talked it over and decided no. I'd like to put her in a facility. He manages to screw that up every time I try. He put her on hospice instead. He doesn't have poa like I told the nurse. So they illegally drew up a new poa. My mom doesn't want him to have any control over her at all. She doesn't want him to have any of her stuff or any of her life insurance when she passes. She wants me to be the sole beneficiary which he currently is. She wants all her possessions to go to me. At first I didn't feel right but now he's being shady screw him. She doesn't want his family to have anything of hers. They see her husband as their cash cow. He wanted to get a second job just to support them. We told him you don't even sleep enough for your first job let alone a second. My mom screams and doesn't let him sleep. We originally agreed to never do anything without telling the other. I held up me end of that deal He didn't. Now I'm just following my mom's wishes. I don't really care about the money part. I'd rather let karma work her magic by letting him have moving home and his family spend it. Then in turn he will have lost our family and all the money and that's revenge enough for me. I'm a Scorpio and I don't give second chances so I'd never forgive him and wouldn't talk to him again. He claims he wouldn't leave and plans on splitting the money with me and my two kids. I don't care about the money like I said but I also don't want my kids to be robbed of their share. My one daughter doesn't care about the money either but the other does. So idk. But am I wrong?",

      "selftext": "I am a school counselor at an elementary school this is year 6 there. I have developed some really good relationships and tend to go above and beyond my counseling duties when I am able. I run things like the school PBIS store once a month and I have helped with some assemblies. I made a video for one PBIS assembly, that was 3 minutes long, to help talk about our focus for the month of responsibility. Admin often comes to me with questions as they are both new. They lean on me for help and support, which I dont mind and value our relationship. It's been a long time since I have had an admin team that is supportive and collaborative. \n\nI have a new cocounselor this year. She is often very long winded and repeats herself, and has been known to corner people and talk to them even after the conversation should be over. We are in education, we don't have a lot of time and need to be quick and intentional often. These are just side notes, she is kind, and a good school counselor. \n\nOur styles of counseling are very different. The kids at school do not see me as admin, I am someone they can joke around with and also come to if they need to talk. I have a great relationship that I have worked so hard to build by being my authentic self.\n\nI have recently noticed that she comes from a lot of privilege and we don't see eye to eye on a lot of things. An example of this is wanting to hotline for a student reporting they have bugs in their house, they live in a duplex that edges the woods, they are well taken care of and rodents are frequent around here we have them in our school. We had a long discussion about it. I dont think she felt supported but I didn't know how else to handle it. I have the sibling in my grade and have worked with this family a lot. A hotline call for something like this would be detrimental to our relationship and I don't feel that bugs are abuse or neglect if the student doesn't have bites or evidence of them (crawling out of their stuff, etc). I ended up telling her to go with her gut, hotline if she felt she should. \n\nAnother incident that rubbed me the wrong way was when she met with a students family she looked up their address in the system. She was telling me about the family, mom is white and dad is black, she made a comment about the affluent neighborhood that they live in and \"they must rent\". \n\nAgain, not super important but gives some background in why I'm feeling the way I am. I realize I commented about her being long winded and I'm writing a book! \n\nAt the beginning of the year our director visited us to talk out a plan for the year and go over our expectations and what not. At that time, I changed my scope and sequence begrudgingly because I knew being in a new school it's nice to feel like you have control over something. I had previously worked hard to get it where it needed to be with the previous cocounselor, based on our students needs. I also made some other changes like how we do lunch duty, which really messed up my schedule, to try and accommodate her. I held her hand for the first 2 months. I invited her to all my teacher meetings and anything she wanted to go to so she felt included and welcome in the building. Social gatherings i always made sure she knew about so she didn't feel left out. I really tried to build a positive vibe in the school, she was in district previously so I knew her but I wanted her to feel welcome in her new school. \n\nRecently she has offered to help with things. For the school store she sat in my office one day for half the day working on buckets to sell things from. I had ziploc bags and was upgrading to plain buckets. She opted to decorate them. While doing this, she complained that she was expected to do it and how it shouldn't fall on us. This was her choice to help and even do this. I was fine with plain buckets. \n\nHere's where it gets interesting. Recently she has been complaining a lot about our administration and how she doesn't feel like they like her. She has also made comments to me, as well as other teachers who are telling me, that \"no one appreciates me, I'm sorry i don't have time to make videos and do all that stuff\". Shots fired am I right? I get it. I am a chairperson for our pbis committe. I enjoy doing things that help cover tier 1 intervention in a fun way. If I can get our kids on board and excited I am down. In the end, it helps limit the number of kids that are coming to me for things they should be able to handle on their own. They are learning their tier 1 skills through pbis lessons and our weekly counseling lessons. I don't feel like this is way outside my scope of work or job description. Maybe it is. \n\nDuring meetings she often asks for me to support her in her thoughts. This part i was an AH and wasn't supportive. She asked \"i have never been used as an incentive in CICO before, have you?\" And because I have, I said yeah. I have. I see how that could have been worded differently and how I wasn't supportive. I apologized for that, in the meeting in front of the same people I said the comment in front of. She fired back \"well [students name] is always in your office so that doesn't count\". The student She listed was going through some issues at the beginning of the year and taking breaks frequently. They had a change in their IEP and have not seen me other than to walk by and say hi, since September. The student was also never on CICO so that wasn't even a relevant comment. \n\nShe has started taking more jabs at me, saying little comments, coming to complain about admin to me while also complaining that they treat her differently than me. She has been bringing up mistakes they made in the first weeks of school, such as calling me for a trauma response when it was her student, calling me first in situations where they need a counselor, a teacher reached out to me about help with an issue, etc. \n\nI got an email from my director saying she wanted to meet with me about my data and the non-school counseling duties I have. I thought this was funny since I hadn't entered much data for the year. Oops I was behind. My director met with me Friday and we talked for quite some time about how things are going. \n\nWhat it boils down to is I dont have my co counselors back and because I do other duties like pbis committee I am making her look bad. The co counselir also expressed that she doesn't want these responsibilities to fall on her shoulders. I get that, but if you don't want the responsibilities don't be the pbis committe chair person? No? I also am stuck with having the obligation of trying to figure out how to make myself less likeable? I don't know. I know I'm being hard headed right now. But the co counselir said she has teachers ask if she is OK because they said my name at an assembly and she never gets recognized. I feel that part isn't the truth but whatever. I made a video they announced I'd be showing it. \n\nI'm stuck on how to navigate this. I'm burdened with the task of stopping all the things I do outside of counseling. I'm also burdened with the task of being more supportive and getting admin to like my co counselor. I'm frustrated. My co counselor is sensitive and often feels attacked by things I wouldn't think twice about. She often comes to me about it and we talk through it but since I don't just immediately agree she feels I'm not being supportive. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I navigate this? Am I an AH for all of this? I am angry I don't want to go back to work and have to deal with this drama on top of my job. ",

      "selftext": "I rather spontaneously found myself taking responsibility for an abandoned cat recently. It was pretty unexpected for literally everyone - coworkers, family, partner - even myself. I don't have permission for a cat from my landlord so it's a bit hush-hush, I didn't even have a litter tray, and I have centered my entire life around my birds. Also my partner despises cats, with a passion. Made a whole song and dance about how the only good cat is a dead cat. My partner and I don't live together, for other reasons (namely that he's burnt out and refuses to seek help that's not me, and also that he breaks up with me every other day and then pretends he didn't).\n\nWhile I've had cats my whole life, it is kinda probationary, depending on how it plays out with the birds. Short term everyone is safe, fed, and happy, I can always find cat a home later on that fits better if necessary.\n\nThing is, partner has done a 180 on cats. Found a love for this one that hasn't existed for our feline friends before. Most people would find that a good thing, but he's started saying how *he* wants to adopt the cat and have something always there when he gets home from work, how a purring lap cat would help his mental health etc. And I'm not saying he's wrong for wanting that necessarily - but this cat isn't currently a lap cat, it might never *be* a lap cat, and cats also don't offer unconditional love and affection, which is what I think he might be after.\n\nAdditionally, he doesn't do any of the feeding or cleaning up after it. Which is fine, the cat is my responsibility after all. But if he adopted it, or claimed ownership of it instead me, I feel like he'd just expect me to do all of that but at his house, for him. And that doesn't sit well with me if I'm being honest.\n\nI tried to broach this with him, suggesting the cat may not be what he envisions, and that it costs money to feed, and take to the vet, and worm and treat for fleas. His rebuttal was that all of that is sorted at adoption, even though I said it's ongoing which he shrugged off and asked how I would afford it then. Right now, I think he just sees it as fun play time, not a 15-20 year commitment.\n\n**WIBTA if I just didn't let him take possession of the cat and either kept it for myself or found it a more appropriate home?** ",

There\u2019s no deep or elaborate reason, just a general fear of addiction ruining lives, I\u2019ve heard plenty of sad stories, and that\u2019s enough for me.\n\nI have a group of friends who are generally mature and rational people, but they don\u2019t share my concern about addiction. They drink and smoke weed, nothing out of the ordinary for people our age. I respect their choices, and they respect mine, so there\u2019s never been an issue.\n\nLast month, I was invited to my friend John's (20M) birthday party, who wanted to celebrate at a casino. At first, I was torn about going, cause I didn\u2019t feel it was fair to miss out on a friend\u2019s birthday just because I didn\u2019t like the place he'd picked, so I decided to bite the bullet and join them.\n\nI didn\u2019t gamble at all while I was there. I just hung out at the bar and watched my friends play, but I didn\u2019t enjoy myself at all. The atmosphere felt tense and charged, and I could see that some of the people there weren\u2019t doing well. I know it\u2019s none of my business, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy and anxious. I was also pretty bored, since all I had to do while I was there was watch them, or be on my phone. That said, my friends seemed to have fun, and I'm glad they did.\n\nAfter that night, I told my friends that while I appreciated being invited and had fun at dinner afterward, gambling just wasn\u2019t for me, and I let them know I wouldn\u2019t be going again. They didn\u2019t make much of it and just moved on with the conversation, so I assumed everyone was fine with it.\n\nFast forward about a month,  another friend, Aiden (20M), decided to celebrate his birthday at a casino as well. When I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable going and that I\u2019d join them for dinner but skip the casino, he got upset. He said it wasn\u2019t fair that I was willing to tough it out for John but not for him. I explained that I overestimated myself the first time, and decided I wasn\u2019t going to do it again. I also reminded him that I'd already said I wasn't going back after John's birthday.\n\nWe went back and forth, but he ended up telling me not to bother coming at all if I was gonna be a dick about it. I agreed and decided to sit this one out.\n\nThe friend group's split on the matter. Some think that if I could go once, I can do it again and it\u2019s no big deal. Others say I shouldn\u2019t force myself into situations I\u2019m not comfortable with just to keep Aiden company.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to go to the casino again?",

I found out what my family here says behind my back, I feel tired and like a burden around here and want to go somewhere with people excited to see me and finally see my best friend after 6 years. \n\nI\u2019ve had trips canceled so many times and been unable to do so much because oooo no that can cause fallout with your dad and I\u2019m just so fed up with not being able to live my life because my brother won\u2019t set boundaries with toxic family and my dads\u2026 well. My dad. I do love him but he has his flaws. \n\nI figured I could text my dad (can\u2019t call cause he rarely answers his phone) to say basically \u201chey I\u2019m going to see family near you but there\u2019s not enough time to see you as well. I\u2019ll see you next visit I hope. Love you\u201d (not exactly that but close enough). I texted my brother my message to get confirmation I can send it but he shut down and hasn\u2019t replied. \n\nI\u2019m so stressed and just wanted to do something I wanted to do without people who shit talk me behind my back being involved but I ofc had to tell my mom and from there my sister knew since she lives here and she suggested my brother and now this. I\u2019m tired and want to cancel but my partner says I should just do something for me for once. What\u2019s the right choice now?",

We had a similar shift one day, meaning our dog would be alone a long time.

Towards the end of my shift, he text messages me to let me know that he got a holiday bonus from his boss, so isn\u2019t going dashing. When I read this message, I decide that I no longer have to leave work early and race home for the dog. About 30 minutes later, he tells me that he is instead of going DoorDash and going to go out for drinks with his coworkers. So now the dog was left alone for an extra hour. \n\nHis argument is that had he done DoorDash he wouldn\u2019t have been home anyway, but my argument is that being out working and making money is a way different reason to not be home then getting wasted with your friends, especially when your dog is home, waiting to be walked. He is claiming he did nothing wrong, and accusing me of attempting to ruin his night because I\u2019m jealous I wasn\u2019t out with his friends.

So this friend of mine is a new parent (less than a year) and I feel very strongly that they aren\u2019t doing right by their child. I feel that the child is last priority for this parent friend of mine. We will call the parent friend Max. For instance, Max is spending money on extra things for themselves every single month, but asking for money for basic necessities for the child (diapers, formula, etc) The child almost has no toys to play with. Every time Max takes the child somewhere, there are no clothes packed, hardly any diapers or wipes, and no toys for them to play with. The baby is almost a year old and is barely eating any baby food because Max is not taking the time to feed the baby. One morning while sleeping over at Max\u2019s house, the baby ate 18 oz of milk in the time span of 3 hours. I felt very strongly that something was not right about that. We were at another friends house one weekend, and Max obviously brought her baby, and the entire 48 hours we were there she touched her child maybe once. She just assumed we would care for the child, which of course we would, but it seemed very strange. Max always has the best of the best and the child lacks basic necessities most months that Max has to borrow money for. It really really bothers me to a point where I am considering not being friends with this person anymore. I want to be able to talk to them, but I am childless (experiencing fertility issues) and I feel like I almost have no place. I never want to parent shame, but I know right from wrong. And they are not doing right by their kid. I  love them both very much (max and the kid) and I want them to be better. Do I have a right to have a conversation with Max? How would I even approach that? Am I an asshole for wanting to make this known? TIA for the advice. ",

      "selftext": "yes. from the title it may seem like I already am the asshole, but listen to the full story then place your judgement.\n\nso for the sake of privacy ill use fake names\n\nFormer Best Friend #1= Samantha (F, 19)\n\nFormer Best Friend #2 = Ava (F, 19)\n\nMutual friend between me and Ava = Andrea\n\nSo to start the story you need context, so I (F, 19) and my closet friends, Samantha and Ava were inseparable. We did everything we possibly could together given time, work and school constraints. We did family events together, we held met ups at our spot somewhat regularly and generally facetimes, texted or communicated in some sort of way at least once a day. We'd met in middle school and we just clicked everything was good for a long time until Ava's mom suddenly passed away during our junior year of high school. Obviously all of us were destroyed but it didn't help the fact that Ava's dad had went back to his home country a few year prior and now since there was no available family member to take care of Ava and her younger sister there dad wanted them to come live in there home country until Ava turned 18 and was able to fend for herself. This news floored all of us as not only did Ava have to deal with loosing her mom, she had no family support besides a nice church lady her mom knew that helped organize her funeral bu8t she also had to give up on her whole life in America for a couple of months until she turned 18. At the time we were all just a few months from turning 18. We as a collective tried to find ways we could let her stay but her dad was just the worst about the whole thing and so Ava had no choice but to get. Samantha promised her that when she was able to come back she'd have a place at her home and i did as well. We saw her off the night she got on her flight and she was gone just like that. She left Sam with her legal stuff and major things but to me she left the keys to her moms house and car. Now for the first few weeks things were good. she'd call and give updates anytime she could. Some things happened to skip a few chapters where i was to give Andrea (f,17 at the time) (a mutual friend we had shared but i wasn't as close with her as ava was) the keys to the house and the car a lot happened but long story short, i gave it back we cleared the air and it was done.  Fast forward a few weeks and we find out that she returned to the states and was living with Andrea, It was a surprise for both me and Sam but our happiness that our friend was back overshadowed anything. then it came out about something with tickets and money owed and her car being towed from Andreas house. It raised a few eyebrows but nobody said anything. After a few weeks of living with Andrea there was a big fallout between Ava and Andrea's mother where she left there house and came to mine. all was good until my mom had called Andrea's mom to discuss what exactly happened as Andreas mother and mine knew each other from a previous interaction. Some things came out that Ava was being incredibly snake like and talking about me, my whole family and my boyfriend behind my back. At first i was 100% on my friends side and so was Sam. We all decided to ignore it but i wanted to know why an adult would have beef with a teenager. So i called Andrea's mom personally and had a talk with her and Andrea and they told me that they had no reason to lie and laid it out for me. In my mind it kind of made sense as there was a period where Me, Sam and Ava we not on the best of terms while Ava was away. I asked Sam about what to do with the information i had received and she stood behind Ava and brushed it off like it was nothing but an older lady trying to create drama. Me and my moms relationship wasn't the best so in early 2024 i got kicked out. there was a big altercation and fight that Ava was there for. Police were involved and the whole nine. So i was staying with my Boyfriend and i knew i had to get Ava out because my mom was already telling me she had to go once i left. So to make things short Ava leaves my house and is staying with Sam. I was working on getting a new job, phone and getting accustomed to my situation (homeless 18 year old senior with no job, money or real saving and a piece of crap car). So my communication went down with everyone tremendously. I didnt talk to may people besides a few selectr people. I hadnt heard from Sam and Ava since the night when Ava left. I will admit in the day before Ava left i was a wreck and was short and cold with everyone, even my boyfriend which was why when i didn't hear form them i thought that might've been why. fast forward to now and its been almost 10 months since me, Sam and Ava had talked. I tried to reach out a couple of times but i was never given a response so i stopped reaching. Recently i got a state job and i remember the whole ticket situation with Ava's mom so i decided to do some investigating. I found out some really important information that needed to get relayed to Ava but i didn't revive a response so i went to Sam to ask her to relay the information. Sam responded with hostility and told me i ignored them for so long why would anything i say constitute as an emergency to them,. I was perplexed. I didn't know i was ignoring them i thought it was the other way around. I have proof of me reaching out numerous times to both of them over the course of t he 10 month period and i even reached out just a month prior to this conversation to see if they wanted to have a meet up and sit down and talk about everything that had gone down in the last year. My feelings, obviously hurt I responded back at the end of the conversation basically saying \"a connection goes two ways and i never heard from you guys once named I'm not breaking my neck to speak to either of you anymore and ill be the bad buy if you want me to be. If you wan a sit down like adults then that'd be fine but I'm not gonna cry and beg for your friendship over text when all you guys are gonna do is ignore me.\" and i left it at that. Since then i haven't gotten a response and my now fianc\u00e9 (who i am still living with but were planning to buy our home in April of 2025!) says i did the right thing but no matter how things go from now he has my support I've also asked my mom and my cousins (who were there to see the whole thing go down in real time) and they all agree with me and said i shouldn't have even offered to do a sit down with them. I cant help feel like I've caused this rift and id like to close that chapter but its been eating away at me since the conversation with Sam and ive only been left on read by Ava. I don't know how to feel about the whole thing on one side i feel validated and i know that you cant force anybody to understand the hurt you went through  but on one side i feel there was more i could've done to reach out and rekindle our friendship a while back. I really do have so much love in my heart for those two and their the people who i considered sisters i mean we went through, death, mental issues, breakups, middle school, high school, covid and everything in between but i don't know if the memories we once had will overpower the current state of our friendship. so reddit ill let you be the judge, AITA for ignoring my friends for almost an entire year?",

That\u2019s where things took a turn.\n\nAfter I asked for the gift receipt it got super awkward and he tried to change the subject by starting to open another present but I just couldn\u2019t get it off my mind. So I addressed the fact that he said he loved the gift and I said if he did love it so much then it wouldn\u2019t be an issue if I took the receipt back. He got frustrated and finally gave me the receipt back which shouldn\u2019t have been an issue anyway. I didn\u2019t know if he gave me the receipt because he was annoyed or because he really did like the gift so I asked him if it would be fine if I ate the receipt to really prove that he didn\u2019t want to return my gift. He hesitated but eventually said I could eat it. This was a huge mistake on my part.\n\nI ate the gift receipt and could immediately feel my stomach churning. I knew before gifts he had went to the bathroom to do a mud pie and he must have used too small of a slice of toilet paper when he wiped. So he likely had mud pie on his hands, touched the receipt a bunch, then I ate it and got sick. After I accused him of this the party got out of control. Another friend of ours offered to eat a receipt that Jacob (the birthday boy) hadn\u2019t touched to see if it was his mud pie or just the paper that made me sick. She ate the receipt and ended up being perfectly fine, which proved that I was right and Jacob did use too small of a slice of toilet paper. After this the party began questioning if Jacob liked any of our gifts and we all decided to leave his house. As everyone left I reminded him that all he had to do was like my gift. He was being a major dick so I told him that nobody even likes his house anyways and that his wife kissed me on the cheek when I got there. Before I walked out of the door I said everyone is gonna go party at my house and that now he\u2019s all alone. I also gave him one last \u201chappy birthday\u201d and I walked out.\n\nAITAH?",

      "selftext": "I\u2018ve debated on and off about ever coming to reddit for advice but I\u2018ve finally found myself at my wits end, I need help. Me and my girlfriend who we\u2018ll call May have been together for three years and some change now and there have been many ups and downs about our relationship. For a little while it was about age gap and maturity, but every time we sat snd talked things out she would always reassure me that she was prepared for anything to come. As some context to the question, May had graduated high school within our first year of dating. No, I did not start dating her when she turned 18. we got together when she had turned 19, but her younger cousin introduced us before her 19th birthday. May\u2018s family which at the time consisted of her youngest brother, her mother, and her mother\u2018s boyfriend, were all a handful and I never knew the magnitude until present day. Her mother has undiagnosed bipolar disorder (I have a bit of knowledge in the field of Psychology while both my brother and mom have their bachelor\u2019s and so on.) with a hint of raging narcissism. Her mom\u2018s boyfriend is a muscleman who only sticks to work, college or college/pro sports games. Not to mention they are both in their mid 40s. The younger brother is now in his double digits but at the time he was still in the singles and had a wide range of authority issues such as following instructions as shown, paying attention when he\u2018s needed or even listening to someone while they\u2018re talking to him, all of which was accepted behavior. Now that that is a little explained, we\u2018ll get to it. May\u2018s mom has been almost a bully to her since I moved into their area be closer to her and live with my brother and that has grown to be much worse. When they were leaving for Florida, May\u2018s mom didn\u2019t give her an option to leave or stay and made the decision for her to stay and move in with me. Mind you, this is right after May graduated high school. I asked May constantly if she was alright with living with me and was ready to jump head first into the work world, and her only answer was yes every time. Fast forward 3 years to today, May and made the plan to order breakfast, cuddle and watch Netflix when her mom called. As usual, May will answer the call and talk about at least ten different topics before the conversation is over which lasts about 45 minutes on average. Today however, her mother called with drama and bad news regarding the you gest brother. He\u2018s fine, but it just underlines my own moral issues with her mother. The topics they touched on plucked at a few nerves almost instantly so I blocked it all out with my earbuds, took a shower and even ate my breakfast while waiting. By the time May had finished her call with her mom, she could already tell my mood had been ruined but we managed to salvage the last hour I had before work to cuddle. Then the question comes. May started by easing her way into the question with starting it off by mentioning just how many things I have in common with her little brother. Gaming is a big hobby of mine and her little brother\u2018s as well, so we clicked with little to no problems. She then went into how I could be a great mentor for him which then caught my suspicion, but I let her finish. When she finally delivered the question, it almost felt like a repeat of the start of our relationship. She wanted me to be the absent guidance her little brother needs to be on the right track in life. A little more into the conversation and may admitted that I had essentially saved her from her parents house when I came along. I asked what she mentioned by that but also telling her to stop while she was ahead. I agreed to being a mentor for her little brother, but she continued anyway with how I got her away from the craziness and disorganized lifestyle. She said she doesn\u2019t want to say it in the bad way or any negative way, but 30% of our relationship was about her finding her ticket out of her previous life with her family, while the other 70% was her falling in love. I couldn\u2019t strum any words about how it made me feel to hear her say that out loud. I\u2018ve always had a feeling that was the case, but she had always begged to differ when I asked her if that\u2018s what the case was. I had a big plan for her Birthday tomorrow but now that I finally hear her say it, I\u2018m not sure how to feel. I\u2018m here at work with my mind all over the place, did she really fall in love from the beginning, or was it all planned. Was I just used as a getaway plan and if so, should I call off the relationship? \n\nTLDR: I (25 M) was just told by my (22 F) girlfriend that I could save her younger brother like I did with her as an exit plan from family drama.

I usually text her to let her know when I\u2019m heading out, whether it\u2019s to the store or my office.\n\nAt some point, the topic came up, and she mentioned that she removed me from her favorites. This means that when her phone is on Do Not Disturb, I\u2019m muted until the afternoon, but our son can always get through to her. In the mornings, the kids typically come to me for anything they need\u2014rides, food, or help\u2014because she\u2019s often sleeping.

Unfaithfulness, dishonesty, polygamy and a generally weak and immature character. \n\nMeanwhile I could blink all that away and hope for him to actually be a lot better than my picture of him is as of now, but there is a table of honour at the wedding reserved for the closest family and their spouses and children. Each and every person at that table is very dear to me and absolutely deserves this special place at my wedding. \n\nSo, AITA for not wanting him at that table and not having a better solution to offer?",

      "selftext": "I (F31) have a younger cousin (F12) who was down visiting family with her mum. During this time, my stepfather had been recently admitted to palliative care. \n\nOn the last day I saw him, plans had been made without me knowing, that I'd be babysitting my cousin for a few nights, we'd meet her at the hospital. In the morning I woke up feeling more sick then I have in years. I had a stomach flu, it was coming out both ends like a broken dam. Any mention of food or smell of, made me instantly queasy. \n\nWhen I got to the hospital to visit him, I met my other family members there. I had to run an errand afterwards which meant I'd be driving over an hour to get back home. My aunt requested that I buy my cousin KFC for dinner. I told them I couldn't, that we could go to the shops and get her something, but the smell would make me sick and I can't deal with smelling it for over an hour. I believe my aunt didn't hear me say this.\n\nSo I take her to the shop, get her food, go back home with her and another family member, I go to bed at 8pm because I'm still feeling so sick. I get woken up in the early hours of the morning, my stepdad had died. I didn't expect it, yes he was in hospital, but we didn't think it'd be this quick. We are utterly devastated.\n\nWhen everyone wakes up at a reasonable hour, we all head over to my mother's house. My aunt meets us there. She spends the entire time trying to convince my mum to go to the pub with her so she can \"drown her sorrows\" then nagging people to hurry up so she can go and get on the piss with her mates. This annoys me but emotions are too high for me to say something to her.\n\nShe asks her kid what she had for dinner that night. We tell her she had chosen 2 minute noodles. My aunt is pissed, she told me to get her KFC, why didn't I get her KFC? I reminded her I was violently ill all day yesterday, but that doesn't matter. According to her, I wasn't really that ill but it was because I don't agree with what she feeds her child. \n\nBackstory: my aunt is a single mother and an absent parent. She will dump her kid on anyone, even strangers, so she can go and get drunk. For the first 8 years of her life, my cousin was raised by other family members while her mother partied (she's 52 by the way). But to make up for it, she buys anything and everything for her kid, allows her to get away with everything, including cruelty to animals and being really rude. She eats junk food every day. I don't agree with it because her kid is always sick. She has stunted growth because my aunt drank heavily throughout her entire pregnancy (went into early labour at 6 months and had to be taken to hospital to stop it, came out of hospital and that night drank 2 bottles of red wine), her crap diet doesn't help her overall health either.\n\nI've expressed this before, when I've been looking after my cousin, that I won't feed her crap. But I've kept my mouth shut about the other stuff because my aunt never sees herself at fault and turns everything into a drama.\n\nBack to the situation. My stepdad had just died, hours before. She's dumped her kid on me so she can go and get pissed. She's angry with me for not feeding her kid more junk food, because I couldn't handle the smell. Accuses me of faking it and being dramatic. Says I'm not the only one effected by his death, then says she wanted me to get my cousin KFC so she could be comforted after seeing my stepdad in hospital. \n\nThis is where I might be the AH. I didn't consider that. She's 12, she understood he was dying. They don't live anywhere near us, she's met him a handful of times, it's not like they're close. But I didn't think that she might be upset seeing him look like that. I was too worried about him, the stupid errand I had to do, and trying not to vom all over my steering wheel to consider her wants during that time.\n\nSo reddit, am I the arsehole?\n\n",

My sisters, although not gifted musicians, can sing fairly well. My grandfather is an extremely religious and spiritual hindu and for the past year I\u2019ve honestly kept my atheism a secret from him. My parents know about my beliefs and so do a few aunts and uncles and my sisters.\nA few days ago my dad told my sisters and I had to sing at the reunion, I didn\u2019t think much of it because I thought he was joking because he knows i hate singing and also praising the lord in song just goes against my beliefs. Later I got added to a family group containing my mother, my aunt and uncle and my sisters with links to the three shlokas we had to sing. I made it very clear to my mother that I didn\u2019t want to this because again I \nA) hate my singing \nB) am an atheist \nShe basically just told me to suck it up and sing because it wasn\u2019t a competition and no one was judging me on my talent. My dad was little to no help and just told me the same thing in a nicer way. The family group has just become a nuisance on my phone now constantly pinging with random messages asking us to practice with a few passive aggressive mentions directed towards me. My sisters just decided it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle to argue but idk if I\u2019m just petty af for putting up a fight or making things difficult for my mother. I love my grandfather but am I really ruining a family reunion because I don\u2019t want to perform on my week off school? I respect my family\u2019s beliefs and faith and I\u2019ve never once shoved my atheism down their throats but I just feel like my personal belief is being disregarded or sometimes just blatantly ignored for the sake of keeping the older generation happy. I still haven\u2019t practiced my shloka and maybe im just petty and selfish and even if i do sing i don\u2019t plan on making rehearsals easy for my mother.\n\nTL;DR: Im being forced to sing religious songs at my family reunion as a tone deaf atheist and I plan on being extremely petty about it.",

      "selftext": "I\u2018ve debated on and off about ever coming to reddit for advice but I\u2018ve finally found myself at my wits end, I need help. Me and my girlfriend who we\u2018ll call May have been together for three years and some change now and there have been many ups and downs about our relationship. For a little while it was about age gap and maturity, but every time we sat snd talked things out she would always reassure me that she was prepared for anything to come. As some context to the question, May had graduated high school within our first year of dating. No, I did not start dating her when she turned 18. we got together when she had turned 19, but her younger cousin introduced us before her 19th birthday. May\u2018s family which at the time consisted of her youngest brother, her mother, and her mother\u2018s boyfriend, were all a handful and I never knew the magnitude until present day. Her mother has undiagnosed bipolar disorder (I have a bit of knowledge in the field of Psychology while both my brother and mom have their bachelor\u2019s and so on.) with a hint of raging narcissism. Her mom\u2018s boyfriend is a muscleman who only sticks to work, college or college/pro sports games. Not to mention they are both in their mid 40s. The younger brother is now in his double digits but at the time he was still in the singles and had a wide range of authority issues such as following instructions as shown, paying attention when he\u2018s needed or even listening to someone while they\u2018re talking to him, all of which was accepted behavior. Now that that is a little explained, we\u2018ll get to it. May\u2018s mom has been almost a bully to her since I moved into their area be closer to her and live with my brother and that has grown to be much worse. When they were leaving for Florida, May\u2018s mom didn\u2019t give her an option to leave or stay and made the decision for her to stay and move in with me. Mind you, this is right after May graduated high school. I asked May constantly if she was alright with living with me and was ready to jump head first into the work world, and her only answer was yes every time. Fast forward 3 years to today, May and made the plan to order breakfast, cuddle and watch Netflix when her mom called. As usual, May will answer the call and talk about at least ten different topics before the conversation is over which lasts about 45 minutes on average. Today however, her mother called with drama and bad news regarding the you gest brother. He\u2018s fine, but it just underlines my own moral issues with her mother. The topics they touched on plucked at a few nerves almost instantly so I blocked it all out with my earbuds, took a shower and even ate my breakfast while waiting. By the time May had finished her call with her mom, she could already tell my mood had been ruined but we managed to salvage the last hour I had before work to cuddle. Then the question comes. May started by easing her way into the question with starting it off by mentioning just how many things I have in common with her little brother. Gaming is a big hobby of mine and her little brother\u2018s as well, so we clicked with little to no problems. She then went into how I could be a great mentor for him which then caught my suspicion, but I let her finish. When she finally delivered the question, it almost felt like a repeat of the start of our relationship. She wanted me to be the absent guidance her little brother needs to be on the right track in life. A little more into the conversation and may admitted that I had essentially saved her from her parents house when I came along. I asked what she mentioned by that but also telling her to stop while she was ahead. I agreed to being a mentor for her little brother, but she continued anyway with how I got her away from the craziness and disorganized lifestyle. She said she doesn\u2019t want to say it in the bad way or any negative way, but 30% of our relationship was about her finding her ticket out of her previous life with her family, while the other 70% was her falling in love. I couldn\u2019t strum any words about how it made me feel to hear her say that out loud. I\u2018ve always had a feeling that was the case, but she had always begged to differ when I asked her if that\u2018s what the case was. I had a big plan for her Birthday tomorrow but now that I finally hear her say it, I\u2018m not sure how to feel. I\u2018m here at work with my mind all over the place, did she really fall in love from the beginning, or was it all planned. Was I just used as a getaway plan and if so, should I call off the relationship? \n\nTL:DR I (25 M) was just told by my (22 F) girlfriend that I could save her younger brother like I did with her as an exit plan from family drama.

      "selftext": "\nI 27F felt so disturbed by 28M but I keep wondering if I invited it and if I did enough to stop it.\n\nI dumped him after 3 dates but weeks later I keep doubting if I overreacted or if it was my fault this happened. Be honest, you can tell me if it\u2019s my fault.\n\nI was a bit drunk on all 3 dates as I was very nervous having not dated in years.\n\nMaybe I should have told him to not do anything sudden.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nOn date 2 we were talking about mental health and he nonchalantly said he\u2019d attempted multiple times, I felt like hugging him but we hadn\u2019t hugged yet so I said I\u2019d had similar struggles and I said I think about it often too. Then he suddenly said, **\u201cI bet you have scars on your arms! Let me see.\u201d**\n\nIt felt so weird but was it just a joke? Cause we both had dark humour and when he\u2019d mentioned poetry and euthanasia and if I knew of Sylvia Plath, **I had said** \u201cyeah, the one who put her head in an oven? Can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d I know that sounds insensitive but I was just using dark humour. Him asking to see scars felt different and invasive.\n\n-Later we walked into some trees and he joked it was a \u201cgood place to hide a body\u201d. I later said \u201cI just want to kiss only\u201d and **he LIED, \u201cDw I wouldn\u2019t take advantage.\u201d And he\u2019d said \u201cI\u2019m a nice guy\u201d twice already.**\n\nWe made out and he said I could touch his butt so then he touched mine, I was ok but then at a point he turned me around and pressed quite hard on my privates (over clothes), it felt uncomfortable so I moved back and he stopped. Ok. \n\nBut then he took both my arms and held them up and out on two instances. I didn\u2019t process my discomfort immediately. I later asked him about a bdsm page he followed and he said he liked bondage and he even (so early) suggested we could have a safe word.\n\n**I told him later I didn\u2019t like when he held my arms up and I don\u2019t want to feel restrained before I know someone very well. And that I\u2019d just woken from a nightmare.** He wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly when or why I did that, I think I was just exploring you, sorry about the nightmare, hope you rest well.\u201d\n\n**I said I don\u2019t want to go further than kissing before knowing each other well and he didn\u2019t reply for an hour. Then he just wrote \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to know about me?\u201d As if to cut to the chase. Why didn\u2019t he just say \u201cOk I understand, we\u2019ll not rush.\u201d?**\n\n-On date 3 he suddenly said **\u201cthe trees smell like c-m\u201d which I brushed off as a lame joke but over the course of like 2 hours he said it three times.** \n\n-Then he asked me about my shoes and he said he wears heels and did drag. I was curious and asked if he\u2019d been with men. He said just kissing. **I shouldn\u2019t have asked this, maybe this is why later he kept steering the conversation to sex. Maybe it\u2019s my fault.**\n\n-We were talking about family and normal things. Then **he asked if a scratch on my thigh was from a shaver. I said no probably I scratched it. He said no that looks like it\u2019s from a shaver. I said I laser them. I said it\u2019s annoying to be hairy. He said he\u2019s hairy too and pulled up his shirt. I was quite drunk and said I like that and it\u2019s weird we\u2019re expected to be hairless as adults.**\n\n**But then he asked if I also lasered my \u201cc\u2026chie\u201d and I looked down and away. Then he said he shaves his \u201cshaft\u201d.** I didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\n-I said I\u2019d deleted my Instagram to not waste time and he said **\u201dYeah my Instagram is full of cats and p-rn.\u201d** Steering the conv to sex again. He said it was women in cosplay \u201cdoing their little sexy dances.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say, why didn\u2019t I just ask to change the subject?\n\nI said \u201cp-rn is ruining how we relate to each other.\u201d He agreed and said some lame joke about \u201cyeah it\u2019s all like suck my d\u2026., goodbye!\u201d And I said yeah it literally sucks and looked away straight faced. **I was trying to avoid conflict and up til then I\u2019d liked him and wanted to salvage the situation.** and I really was starved of connection and doing very badly mentally and wanted to cuddle with someone. \n\n-Then **he said he had an OF and I was taken aback, I just asked if he had posted identifying stuff and he said no but it was mostly guys messaging him so he stopped.**\n\n-**His profile had said \u201cnon smoker\u201d and he smoked and said to ignore the profile, he wanted to quit.**\n\n-When we made out **he (not rushing) tried to put his hand in my pants but i took his hand gently away and he stopped but he asked \u201cwhy? Are you on your period?\u201d We were outside and there was no need for me to justify my NO. But I said nothing and just kissed him. Then later he said if he showed me his i\u2019d show him mine \u201ctit for tat\u201d.** But he didn\u2019t try to put his hands in again.\n\n-Then he told me I could touch him so I did over his pants, He **said that if I made him c-m in his pants he\u2019d kill me cause that takes ages to clean.** Weird \u2018joke\u2019 to say on a 3rd date barely knowing someone.\n\n-He asked if I wanted to go to his place and I half-joked if he\u2019d ghost me after and he said \u201cHas that happened to you? **I don\u2019t think I will do that.\u201d** Which had me feeling he was saying he MIGHT.\n\n-I had also texted that I was melting from heat and getting motion sick on a long taxi ride and he\u2019d texted, **\u201cYou\u2019re putting yourself through hell to hang out I\u2019m honestly impressed \ud83d\ude01\u201d then later \u201cthere\u2019s a breeze hope you\u2019ll be comfy\u201d but that was two opposite things.**\n\n-Also **he\u2019d asked me my fears at one point. Then i asked his and he said he didn\u2019t have any.** ???\n\n-The worst part. He hugged me tight normally from behind but then **he started squeezing and I felt my breath start to be pushed out.**\n\nThis happened fast in like 2 seconds. I exhaled, \"Too tight.\" With some difficulty. He stopped, said sorry, then **immediately squeezed (lightly this time) again for like a second before fully stopping.** It felt like him purposefully pushing boundaries. Why didn\u2019t he immediately stop? But I kept kissing him later cause I didn\u2019t process what he did immediately.\n\nI complained about it and said I wanted to break things off and we had a back and forth with me saying how hurt I was about that squeeze cause I wasn\u2019t able to catch my breath, and this wasn\u2019t working out. His text responses were:\n\n\u201cI understand and I agree\u201d (meaning he agreed to stop meeting). \u201cI still primarily don\u2019t want to cause any discomfort.\u201d He seemed unsurprised that I had just told him I hadn\u2019t been able to catch my breath.\n\n\u201cOk I\u2019ll leave you be, I\u2019m honestly sorry for all this hardship.\u201d\n\n\"I really tried\n\n\u201c**it's not really fair** you know I didn't mean anything bad, this is too rough for me to deal with. \n\n\"**I didn't even realize** I did it so tight\n\n\u201c**I just hugged you I'm twice the size of you** (he\u2019s not, more like 50% bigger than me)\n\n\"**I can't be that delicate** and i obviously didn't do it on purpose\n\n\"**Didn't all the good time we have outweigh that one split second**?\n\n\"That's why **this isn't fair I've been complimented on my hugs** more than I have not lots of people like being held tightly (completely ignoring the fact I'd said no and that **I WROTE THAT I HADN\u2019T BEEN ABLE TO BREATHE.** It wasn\u2019t just a hug.)\n\n\u201cThose two seconds have caused so much hardship I am sorry. I really think we should leave each other alone (here I think he was realising I wouldn't just let him do anything he wanted to me) (I said it felt like he didn\u2019t care and I was hurt by this)\n\n\u201cAre you really trying to upset me? I do care **you have to leave room for mistakes** to happen nobody's perfect in two days of meeting them.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a bartender, very socially skilled and said he\u2019d had around \u201c13 or 14\u201d previous partners so how the hell did he not know it wasn\u2019t ok to treat a woman like that? How did any woman ever stay with him???\n\nAlso at a point I said I hadn\u2019t dated much cause it was hard to trust and he blurted, **\u201dYeah. Men, we\u2019re cons.\u201d** I couldn\u2019t believe he said that. \n\nAnd later he said he wasn\u2019t comparing me to a dog but that my eyes reminded him of the love in a dog\u2019s eyes. Weird. Someone said it was negging? Was it? I said it bothered me and he said he meant it nicely and that he had loved his dog with his \u201cwhole heart, and holding you like that was jealous on my end\u201d. Made no sense.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t affectionate at all just went straight to touching private areas.\n\nAt the end he also made some weird mansplaining comment and told me \u201cmen get wet too, there\u2019s this thing called precum\u201d. Wtf. Mansplaining that?",

I've got to go back 27 years...short story my dad cheated on my mom while she was pregnant with twins, twins born early in NICU for 8 weeks, 2 days after discharged home my dad moved out and in with his girlfriend (same girl from cheating). When he left he pretty much wiped his hands of us kids 18, 13, 2x2 months. I've tried to have a relationship with him but he's so self-absorbed he doesn't have a relationship with any of his 5 biological children (I have a half sister from his gf made wife). \n\nThis weekend my cousin on my dads side got married. He was not invited because my cousin told me & my sisters it was more important to her that we were there not him. \n\nIt was a no kid wedding which was fine, we have 4 boys 18(high functioning autistic), 15, 12, 6. We had childcare set up. My husband and I were looking forward to the weekend away. \n\nFriday our youngest came home from school with a 12 hour stomach bug that had been going around his classroom. My husband and I discussed what to do about the wedding which was a 4 hour drive away from home. We decided to wait to see how he felt Saturday morning, figured he would feel fine and he did. \n\nWe called the person who was going to stay with but she didn't want to stay with them any longer as her full time job is day care with infants. Which was what I figured. We discussed leaving the boys home but ultimately decided that was a bad idea as our 18 yo & 12 yo cannot get along and not fair for 15 year old to play referee. \n\nWe stayed home.  Didn't go to wedding. I'm upset. I'm upset I didn't get to go to her wedding. I'm upset it was a family function that I didn't have to watch my back for my dad the entire night. I'm upset that my husband and I didn't get our time away. I'm upset we couldn't trust our kids. \n\nHe thinks I just have moved on. Basically say oh well didn't get to go and move on. No big deal I didn't get the time with family with no worries. He's pissed at me that I'm upset. AITAH?",

When their mother passed away, she left them a substantial inheritance, which I\u2019ve carefully managed in trust funds for their future education and other needs. My late wife and I always prioritized their future, and this money is meant to support their goals, whether that\u2019s college, starting a business, or something else they dream of.\n\nA few years ago, I married my current wife (39F), who has two kids from her previous marriage, Ethan (15M) and Sophie (12F). I love my stepchildren and treat them with the same care and respect as my own, but their father is still in their lives and provides financial support. While I contribute to their day-to-day needs, my wife and I never discussed blending the finances meant specifically for Anna and Jake.\n\nRecently, my wife brought up the idea of using some of Anna and Jake\u2019s trust funds to help with Ethan and Sophie\u2019s upcoming expenses, such as extracurricular activities and potential college savings. She argued that it\u2019s unfair for my biological kids to have such a financial advantage while her children don\u2019t. She believes that as a family, we should pool resources equally for all the kids.\n\nI told her that I couldn\u2019t do that. The trust funds were set up solely for Anna and Jake, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to take money from them that their late mother intended for their future. I offered to work with her to find other ways to save for Ethan and Sophie, but she was upset, accusing me of playing favorites and not fully accepting her kids as part of the family.\n\nThe argument escalated when her parents got involved, suggesting I was being selfish and that it\u2019s my responsibility to treat all the children equally. Now, even Anna and Jake are aware of the situation and feel awkward, worrying that they\u2019re being resented by their stepfamily.\n\nI feel torn because I love my stepkids and want them to succeed, but I also want to honor the intentions behind the money their mother left for them. So, AITA for refusing to share my biological kids\u2019 funds with my stepchildren?\n",

That was the last straw for me.

      "selftext": "I am in desperate need of a second opinion regarding recent events with my GF. Note that this is a really long post. I really need help though - your input is going to have an indirect impact on my life. All that I have is my own perspective I don\u2019t trust it. I\u2019m trying to figure out if there as an objective way to determine if someone is toxic. We have been dating for 2 years - we met eachother at the end of our freshman year in ollege and undoubtedly experienced love. We did not spend a day apart for over 4 months, despite living an hour away from each other. The memories I have with her bring tears to my eyes when I think of where we are today. Today, we argue at least daily. It feels like there is so much hidden spite. We live together, unofficially. This is just a little background info to give you guys a little more context. \n\nYesterday was her 21st birthday party - note that her actual birthday is today. I spent a lot of time planning it. I messaged all of her friends individually. Told them time and place, what to expect. I got all necessary items for the party. Tables, cups, drinks, poker table/chips (at her request), etc. I probably spent $1000 collectively on this birthday, presents included. She helped with the decorations, at my request. I\u2019m not an artistic guy and am terrible at decorating - she knows this. We spent half of yesterday afternoon arguing while getting decorations set up. It was not a pleasant experience for either of us. She doesn\u2019t like when I question her methods or something doesn\u2019t go her way. I invited her friend over to help in hopes that it would cheer her up. It did. While her friend was there, it was a golden time. Not even 5 minutes after her friend left, we started arguing again. Anyways - once the party started it was once again a golden time. We had a great night, I thought. The next morning we wake up, and we go pick up drinks from Starbucks and breakfast from a local diner. We go home and eat these. I had an important phone call at 11 that I had told her about 3 days before. After the call, things started going downhill. I have an end of semester group project that is notoriously strenuous and difficult. I told her that I had to meet with my group today and explained that peer feedback is a heavy percentage of our grade. Yesterday, I had made her aware that there is a possibility of me meeting with my group on her birthday but that I would try to get out of it. \n\nMy gf is a big eagles fan and had told me that she wanted to watch the game today. She became upset that I was going to meet with my group. I made up an excuse to my group and told them I couldn\u2019t get there until 3 so I could watch the first half with her. This is a text I wrote to her after she said that all she wanted to do was watch the eagles game with me. \n\n\u201cYeah XXXXXXX i understand your frustration. But I don\u2019t think you understand the position I am in. As much as I wish \u201cI\u2019m watching the eagles game with my gf bc it\u2019s her birthday\u201d was a valid excuse it really doesn\u2019t cut it. I have to choose between failing on a project or spending time with my gf on her birthday. I gave you all of my time yesterday. \n\nI feel pretty unappreciated - I\u2019m just realizing how much I spoil you only to feel like I\u2019m getting treated like shit. There is no gratitude. I tried to put myself in your shoes - I wouldve told you to get what you needed done bc u did so much for me already. Then maybe make plans to eat out in the evening. You just get angry at me.\u201d\n\nThe 2nd paragraph is not something that I have addressed, and I really don\u2019t know how to explain myself it\u2019s just the way I feel. I felt unappreciated. I didn\u2019t think she was thankful for all that I had done to try and make her birthday special. The reason why exactly? That remains a mystery to me. I wish I knew because then I could address it. I think it\u2019s because when I told her I had to meet with my group she got angry with me. She wanted more from me but didn\u2019t even realize how much I had given her the day before. I felt like what I had done the day before justified my decision to go with the group basically.  \n\nI followed up with this paragraph \u201cBut yeah if you disagree strongly with my 2nd paragraph then we need to talk. Your friends showed more gratitude to me for helping plan your birthday party than you did. It feels like you just disregarded all the presents I got you. I put a lot of time and thought into it and although the surprise part of it got spoiled, I still did this for you. I can\u2019t make you happy. I\u2019m tired of getting walked on. I literally do anything you tell me and dont say no. I get everything for you. Anything you ask for. And then you just turn around and pretend like I don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nThe bottom part of the paragraph is true. But the thing is, Im fairly certain I don\u2019t do these things out of love - I do it because I feel like saying no isn\u2019t an option. She always asks for things and is very very picky. But when she wants something, I will get it for her. I rarely say no. For example, randomly she will have a craving - \u201cI want sweet tea.\u201d I\u2019ll ask her where from and then go get it, usually with her. It feels like I can\u2019t say no to these things - would a caring boyfriend deny their loved one\u2019s desires? Where do I draw the line? \n\nAnyways. She respond to this paragraph with 4 different texts. \n\u201cOkay\u201d\n\u201cBreak up with me on my birthday already\u201d\n\u201cMade it to 21\u201d\n\u201cNow I can die\u201d\n\u201cEveryone hates me anyways\u201d\n\nI respond:\n\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s not gonna help\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to have a mature conversation we can\u201d\n\u201cIf not then it\u2019s better not to talk. I\u2019d prefer to have a real adult conversation.\u201d\n\u201cI told you how I feel, and you turn it into a guilt trip\u201d\n\nShe responds:\n\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just tired\u201d\n\u201cI gave up my whole life for you\u201d\n\u201cI dropped everything freshman year to be with you and commit to you\u201d\n\u201cIf you feel this way then leave me. There\u2019s no need for a \u201creal adult conversation\u201d because neither of us can communicate with each other. You either want to be done or don\u2019t and it really sounds like you want to be done. No guilt tripping here, just truth.\u201d\n\nFrom here it just goes into nothing just pointless bickering. I don\u2019t know what to think of this situation. There are many instances like this. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong, or if she is. Am I a toxic person? Is she? I just want what\u2019s best for both of us. I love her and have done a lot to try and make this work. The memories we have together are what are holding us together, I think. I know this was REALLY long. But please someone I am need of advice. ",

I planned on getting myself a new pair. My boyfriend was the first person to notice that the earphones were malfunctioning cuz we were on FaceTime and he couldn\u2019t hear my talk at so with my AirPods in. So I told him that I\u2019m just getting the same ones again once I get my paycheck the following week. He asked me why I don\u2019t upgrade to the AirPods Pro. I responded that I\u2019ve tried both before since my parents have both but I just 1. Didnt like the way it looked and 2. They hurt my ears, which the gen 2 doesn\u2019t. Plus the gen 2 is way cheaper so it just makes sense for me. \n\nThe following week, I get a notification that I got a mail. Lo and behold, my dear boyfriend got me a pair of gen 3 AirPod. They were refurbished so there were scratches on the actually case but that didn\u2019t bother me. But I felt a little bittersweet idk. I was very thankful that he got me a new pair of earphones but it\u2019s as if he wasn\u2019t listening to what I was saying at all and that kinda upset me. \n\nUnfortunately, I made the mistake of asking him why he got me the gen 3 if he knew I preferred the gen 2. He said he thought I needed an upgrade but that I can return them if I didn\u2019t like them so he can get his money back. I knew he was rightfully hurt because I would be too if someone didn\u2019t necessarily appreciate the gift I gave them. At that point I didn\u2019t know what to do and I felt like an asshole I just returned them cuz idk at least he\u2019s getting his money back rather than seeing me wear these knowing I questioned his gift? Idk what the logic was really lol. I did end up getting myself a pair of gen 2 anyways which were like $80 cheaper than the gen 3s so. Idk I just apologize stating that it wasn\u2019t my intention to come off as ungrateful and reassured him that I really appreciate his gift, but a part of me is feeling weird cuz he essentially never heard a single word I said. Idk am I the asshole here?",

I have had a rough time recently and am doing some pretty intense research so needed a break. I paid for it myself for both of us as he doesn't work. The day before i was quite poorly and was trying to sleep in an attempt to be well enough to go. He kept waking me up so i went downstairs to sleep. He then followed me and stopped me sleeping again being aggy and argumentative so i told him to leave me alone to rest. \n\nCouple of hours later he just got dressed, totally ignored me and went out. This is a boundary i have communicated with him because in the past he threatened to kill himself, threw his phone into a lake and went ghost for weeks. It really messed me up at the time and when he just storms out in a mood i just get scared he is doing the ghost thing again. Anyway its something i have told him is a line for me. I messaged him and asked him what he was doing and he said he was going to his mums. I checked the location app we have an he was in the pub. He stayed in the pub all night.\n\nI was obviously upset about this as I was ill, there was lots to do round the house and we hadn't packed and organised ourself for our trip yet. I was upset I had been lied to and had my boundaries just stepped but he kept belittling the situation and saying I was just mad he woke me up and I'm a nightmare and hard to love and crazy.I just feel so disrespected. I told him i felt like i was being manipulated and it disgusted me. \n\nAnyway it go to about 3 hours before the flight and he was still out and being generally difficult over text. The flight has now been and gone and i have lost the holiday. He is still not home. Ive told him the engagement is off and i cant marry him. Now he is saying im the a hole and im making him homeless (he can move in with hi friend who he lived with before or him mum he isnt homeless). That im crazy and insane for throwing the relationship away but its all because of me this is happening. \n\nAITAH?",

I do the cleaning in the house, it has always been my job and since we live in a rather small appartment it's not much of a bother, just vacuum the house every two days for the dog hair, mop right after, dishes every night and take out the trash from time to time.\n\nDespite this, my mother tends to throw tantrums when emotionally unstable (when tired, in love or drunk) where she starts yelling and crying saying i dont do anything for her and i dont care about her, saying i dont have empathy and sometimes resorting to throwing objects, glasses of water and such at walls or furniture.\n\nShe's a therapist and repeats to me that i have all the behavioral symptoms of asperger syndrome, diagnosis which was denied by a psychiatrist after i decided i wanted to be sure and made the appointment myself. \n\nWhile i am not perfect i will admit, (i tend to struggle with my (diagnosed) depression and cant keep a decent sleep schedule for the life of me and, because of this, tend to struggle with expressing and controling my emotions and needs) i've been trying to do my best to keep us afloat through the past couple of years.\n\nYesterday, i wasnt home, went driving to pick up a dog i was gonna be keeping, she threw another one of those tantrums, i got home to broken glass all over the floor, her car missing, and an emptied bottle of wine on the table. \n\nNow usually, when these tantrums take place, i lock the dogs in my room so they dont get hurt because of the glass, this time though, i found my own dog, Hubble, with his paws bleeding. I of course immediatly took him to the vet, where i stayed for a couple hours, went back home and cleaned the mess. \n\nShe usually comes back fairly fast after leaving for this kind of emotional outburst, but she wasnt coming back and wasnt answering her phone, i went to pack everything i'd need in the future, computer, all my schoolwork, some clothes and some books, statched my guitar, simracing rig and other expensive equipment i paid myself in my garage (i rent myself for a motorcycle i bought myself as well) decided to take the dogs at a friends house. \n\nI left a note to my mom saying i was closing her access to my bank account and that despite all i loved her, she had gone too far and needed to be helped, i told her i was leaving for a while and that i'll be getting my own appartment. I've been staying at my friends house since, and i'm looking into renting an appartment nearby...\n\nDid i overreact ? Should i go back on my decision and come back to take care of her ? Should i try to get her professional help ? What do i do ? I'm honestly quite lost",

After some time, I developed feelings for her and confessed, but she rejected me.\n\nA few weeks later, I met another girl online (we\u2019ll call her B). We started an online relationship. It began with sexting, but very quickly, it became more emotional. My connection with B lasted only one or two weeks, and we never met in real life. I\u2019m not sure, but she might have been a catfish. She told me some hard-to-believe stories about her life. Once, she sent me fake pictures, and when I asked for a verification photo, she sent one where she was covering her face. So, while I was sure she was a girl, I was never sure what her face actually looked like.\n\nB tried to break up with me three times. The first time was because of a mistake I made. The second time, she said she wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship and wasn\u2019t in a good mental state. I insisted and tried to save the relationship, and it worked for a while. But soon after, she said again that she couldn\u2019t be in a relationship and we should break up. This time, I accepted, and she blocked me. A few hours later, she unblocked me and asked me to help her with her studies, so I did. Then, I suggested we could be \"friends with benefits,\" and she agreed. The reason I suggested this was because the sexting had been good. I clearly told her that we could both date other people, and she agreed.\n\nA day or two later, A texted me, asking if we could meet. I regret it, but I told B that I was going to meet A the next day. She freaked out, said she loved me, begged me not to meet A, and acted like she was going to commit suicide. To stop her from doing that, I told her I wouldn\u2019t meet A, but she went offline as if she was about to hurt herself. The next day, I met A. We just had coffee and talked for a while. That night, B texted me again. I told her I was really sorry, but we couldn\u2019t continue because of her family situation, etc. She begged me not to leave her. Because of that, I told her I wouldn\u2019t leave, but a few minutes later, I texted her saying we couldn\u2019t be together. I then blocked her. She texted me from different numbers, and I blocked those too.\n\nNow, months have passed. I have a healthy relationship with A. B is still alive, but I don\u2019t really care about her anymore. However, I still feel guilty. I imagine scenarios where karma ruins my current relationship. What if one day A dumps me like that? What if she finds someone else and leaves me?",

      "selftext": "I want to preface with I\u2019m not great at storytelling. \n\nWhen I interviewed for the house, the only thing that was said about needs/accommodations was low scented cleaning products and \u201clight use\u201d around drugs. Nothing specified, no further communication, I didn\u2019t expect it to grow in to anything difficult. They\u2019ve slowly started to complain about more and more. House of 5- we\u2019re asked to text a group chat when ever we use a blender or vacuum. They throw out NON scented cleaning sprays, others products that are too strong for them, complain about weed smell regardless of the frequency. They don\u2019t contribute to buying cleaning products, they just throw out what others buy if they don\u2019t like it. When I first moved in 6 months ago, I strictly wouldn\u2019t smoke inside and just me grabbing my weed and leaving was \u201ctoo strong of a smell\u201d. Since it\u2019s getting colder and I have physical disabilities that weed helps with, I\u2019ve started to smoke out my window with an air purifier as well. I\u2019ll still go for a walk if I can but that\u2019s not always a thing I can do. I\u2019m also just tired of making so many accommodations when they have no flexibility with my, or others needs or accommodations. They stomp through out the house and wave it off as anxiety. They have piles of trash all throughout the house and don\u2019t clean up after themselves. Multiple roommates have offered to help them clean up their stuff and it\u2019s not accepted. We\u2019ve tried to clear out trash from old roommates but they always \u201cwant to keep it\u201d or return it to the person. Past roommates have been contacted and they\u2019ve said they don\u2019t have anything here or they specify they don\u2019t want the item. The smell of mold from their room and belongings is horrible. When they do end up showering, the bathroom wreaks of urine. They have actively lied about COVID precautions (this house was advertised as a COVID conscious house). They hardly ever clean and when they do (because it\u2019s brought to their attention) they burn themselves out detailing a small area of the house and then stop cleaning for multiple months. They avoid accountability when they are called out and play the victim. They complain- worrying about mold but also actively stop others from taking action to clear out the house. And the first step to mold remediation is us cleaning ourselves. Every solution anyone has brought up to them, they pushback and it\u2019s exhausting fighting for my needs/boundaries to be respected. 2 new people have moved in recently and since they\u2019ve moved in the complaints have slimmed but since, they\u2019ve also not been able to pay rent, don\u2019t foresee being able to pay next months rent, and complaints have started to come back. The new roommates have not been asked to not smoke in the house (one roommate has told them to their face that they\u2019re going to go smoke in their room and will smoke on the porch) \n\nThe other roommate has a cat (bad roommate has prevented others from getting pets due to the \u201csmell of pets\u201d). I was struggling to eat enough and wanted a second fridge (because 1 fridge for 6 people - now 5 seems ridiculous) and it got pushed back due to how much it would raise the power bill. I get that everyone living in this house should be able to have things throughout the house but they take up so much space to where no one can functionally use the space.\n\nAitah for smoking out my window when bad roommate refuses to accommodate my needs (fridge, cleaning up after themselves, cleaning period, removing piles from common areas, stinking up house with BO and mold) but also hold me to their needs while not asking that of others? And not trying to accommodate themselves first?\n\nHow do I tell them no, I will not be controlled in my room when I pay my rent. 4/5 roommates smoke or are ok with the smell. \n\nI also understand that this is absolutely a mental health issue. Others and myself have talked about multiple ways to help them and it goes no where. \n\nAdvise? Options? I can\u2019t afford to move out ",

      "selftext": "Okay so for context, I [19F] went on a few dates at the end of this summer with [M23]. We had a great time, he was mature, got plans for the future, had some interests in common and I thought even if it didn\u2019t take a romantic turn I\u2019d like to have him as my friend. So fast forward, after our third date he messages me that he liked spending time with me but he\u2019s not in a place atm where he\u2019s ready for a relationship. Mostly because he had been in a long term relationship and the breakup was still kinda fresh. I thought it was great that he was communicating and said as it was, I\u2019m not doing this Situationship bullshit. After this we went separate ways. A month later I got, what felt like, a booty call where he didn\u2019t say he wanted to meet up but was talking about how he was spending the weekend in his moms apartment all by himseeelf (his parents live close to me). And when I asked what he wanted I got blocked. 1,5 months after thaaat he reaches out again and wanna talk about stuff. We do and I feel like we still want different things but anyways. During this whole time I\u2019ve had this girl stalking my instagram, I don\u2019t have a big following and I always like to look through who\u2019s stalking my stories. When I go through her instagram I see old photos of the guy I had seen a few times. Thought that it could be his ex, decides that it wasn\u2019t bcs why would she have pictures with him? So maybe a friend or a relative, besides why would his ex be stalking me? I barely knew this guy. So today I saw that she\u2019s in my stories yet again, ask him who it is and he gets all defensive and asks me \u201cwhy\u201d and then says that it\u2019s his \u201cex/best friend/ a person he really cares about\u201d. Okay so I immediately got pissed. Why hasn\u2019t this guy mentioned his close relationship with his ex, why has he been talking about me to her (she wouldn\u2019t know of me otherwise) and why is this bitch getting defensive? She\u2019s the one stalking me? So this is where I might be TAH, I told him to tell her that she can follow me instead so she doesn\u2019t have to waste her time on stalking me. My friend thought that was kinda harsh since the girl hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. But like, am I justified in being this angry? I barely even know why. How would you have reacted?\n\nFast lil edit:\nOkay I guess I\u2019m shit at wording stuff because people are missing the point I was trying to make. I\u2019m not mad at the fact that a stranger is looking at my Instagram. I\u2019m mad about a date informing an ex girlfriend (who also was the reason he didn\u2019t wanna keep seeing me) about me. On top of that with enough info for her to be able to look me up, while I didn\u2019t even know they were still in contact and even less they were \u201cbest friends\u201d. I feel like that\u2019s something you tell someone? Especially when you reach out again and wanna \u201cmake things work\u201d???",

I am now staying with my real dad until I am able to move in to my new apartment. The apartment isn\u2019t available until December 21st of 2024.\n\nI have four siblings who are 15, 13, 11, and 9. My mother married my stepfather then I was 1. My younger siblings are from her and her stepfathers relationship. My mother is a neglectful mom. She allows her husband to mistreat me. Her husband has hit me, spat on me, shoved me, and stolen from me time and time again. \n\nThe rules in the house are that I pay 400 a month in rent, for a small bedroom. I have to buy and eat my own food, I have to pay the internet bill, which is 100$. Even though I PAY RENT, I am not allowed to lock my doors, I\u2019m not allowed to lock the door in the bathroom, I\u2019m not allowed to use the internet after 6 pm, EVEN THOUGH ITS IN MY NAME, and I pay the bill. I\u2019ve been respecting their rules. Recently I bought a new computer, I am containing my studies. I am starting school for medication aide. When I finish school I\u2019ll have a medication aide certification, on top of the CNA liscense I have, after medication aide courses are complete for me, I am going to take phlebotomy. The laptop I bought was 350$, and that was because it was on sale! \n\nYesterday my stepfather demanded more money from me after I paid all the bills required of me! He is a drunk, he has a drinking problem and my mother enables him. They neglect the kids they have. They always go out to eat, drink, and my mother always has her nails and hair done but \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the money\u201d to take care of her kids. As a result I\u2019ve been taking care of them. I told him that I wasn\u2019t giving him anymore money! \n\nThis was early yesterday morning. I went to work and came back later in the day. I went into my room and noticed my door was open, and my room got trashed. My laptop was gone. I asked my siblings if they had seen my laptop. They said no. I went upstairs and asked my mother if she\u2019d seen it. She said, \u201cWell (stepdads name) sold it to the pawn shop because he needed money for household expenses.\u201d\n\nAt this point I was livid because I needed that laptop for school. I said, \u201cI paid all of my required expenses for the house. He had no right to take that laptop that I had.\u201d Basically she said that it\u2019s their house their rules, and that if I didn\u2019t like it I could leave. I called my father, and asked him if I could stay with him until December 21st. My dad, being the rockstar he is, let me stay with him. He\u2019s not charging me rent or utilities! \n\nEarly in the morning today. I went down to the magistrate to press charges. I reported him to the police for his past violent behavior, and for the theft. I blocked my mother and stepfather on everything! I reported my mother and stepfather to CPS for neglect and to report a dangerous environment! A few hours after, my mother called my dad furious, she said, \u201cShe reported my husband for simply needing money. The police came to our house and arrested him\u201d The area I live in my country, they take theft or any crime for that matter, very seriously. I\u2019m surprised they arrested him so fast! I\u2019m wondering if CPS is as quick. \n\nAlso for clarity: My mother was stupid enough to admit his crimes through text messages. I showed the police and magistrate the messages. \n\nAITAH? I feel bad for my siblings, I don\u2019t want them to go to foster care, but at the same time they live in a dangerous environment! \n\n",

      "selftext": "Context: \nWe became friends in Year 7 (11 years old) and we were really good friends, we had a friend group of 6.\nIn this time period many concerning behaviours were shown by her which I will list below:\n - Said the N-word twice, on purpose and didn't apologise (she can't say it)\n - She was transphobic to literally the sweetest girl I know and implied that she shouldn't be able to change in the same room as us TO HER FACE\n - Blatantly just homophobic to me and my other queer friends.\n - Ableist to this guy who has autism (affects his speech and general manner), I have autism too she just didn't know that.\n - Fatphobic to me and Sophie (neither of us are, and no she was not saying it as a joke.) example: when I sat down on this wobbly bench and it moved BECAUSE IT'S WOBBLY she said \"how fat are you?\" Like..?\n - Literally ANYTHING I would do she would point out and make fun of, causing me to feel self conscious all the damn time\n\nOk, so in Year 9 halfway through the year she leaves our friend group (YESSS) due to us \"being annoying and repeating the same jokes\", namely calling eachother fatties \nCONTEXT: we are all okay with it, we all find it funny, like two of us could be eating at the same time and we'd call eachother big eventhough we're both eating, so, we're cool with it, right.\n\nSo, I look at her reposts on TikTok occasionally to have a little giggle to myself and guess what I see? A repost saying basically \"I'm really not the kind of person to be making fat jokes around, I hate them\" which is fair enough, right? BUT. Guess what little old me heard her saying the other week to her new friends? Yep, you guessed it, she was calling them fat. Ummm ok girl whatever you say totally not hypocritical at all !\n\nAnyway so all my friends know all the stuff she's done to me and I actively ignore her and don't talk to her. We literally sit next to eachother in a lesson I have not uttered a single word to her which is probably very immature but considering everything she's put me through I think it's justified. However, my friends are CONSTANTLY talking to her and being friendly which really upsets me as they swear they hate her but still are friendly with her... idk. I feel like this just makes her think that her actions are forgivable and she'll continue doing it. It just seems weird to me maybe because I've hated her since Year 8 and only in Year 9 when she left did my friends admit that there were things they didn't like about her.\n\nOh and another thing, my bestfriend is the one who talks to her the most because she's a massive people pleaser and can't stand the thought of anyone disliking her, anyway so, whenever I talk bad about the original girl she always says \"oh but she's really nice now\"\nNo. She isn't. She just seems that way because you aren't close with her right now (once she gets to know you, then she starts to make digs at you). Also she really can't be that nice because the friend group she found after us dropped her like, last week. And also I'm scared she's going to rejoin our friend group sine she has like, one friend now. I had a dream about that a few days ago and had a panic attack in my dream because of it.\n\nOkay, thank you for reading all of this. Also, AITAH?\n\n",

      "selftext": "I\u2019m a 26 M living in a really frustrating and unfulfilling situation, and I need some outside perspective. For the past 2  years, I\u2019ve been living with 3 brothers but Am going to be focusing on the 2 older brothers, aged 28 and 34, who are my housemates. We\u2019re supposed to be splitting rent. The problem is, they don\u2019t work\u2014by choice. I (and the other brother 27) are consistently working and contributing financially, while the others rely on our income to keep us afloat.\nThe current arrangement is that I pay a significant portion of the rent and bills, When I come home, the apartment is never cleaned.. even when I go to bed, I can\u2019t because they shout at their video games ALL NIGHT.  Meanwhile, I\u2019m working hard and sacrificing a lot to stay afloat, to the point where I don\u2019t eat because I essentially can\u2019t afford to at times. To make it worse, I haven\u2019t had my own room in years, which has taken a toll on my mental health.\nRecently, I\u2019ve started saving up to move out and finally get some independence and privacy. To add to it, one instance I was not asked to but TOLD to pay the internet bill, which boiled my blood. I\u2019ve reached a breaking point where I\u2019m thinking of leaving without notice. I know that if I leave, they won\u2019t be able to make rent, which would likely result in an eviction. Part of me feels guilty about this because I know it\u2019ll cause chaos for them. But at the same time, they\u2019re adults who have had years to figure things out and have consistently chosen not to work.\nI feel like I\u2019ve been carrying this household on my back, and I\u2019m exhausted. I\u2019ve started to resent them for their lack of effort and for taking my help for granted. I want to prioritize my own well-being, but I\u2019m worried I\u2019ll look like the bad guy if I just leave without warning.\n\nSo, AITA if I move out without notice, knowing it\u2019ll likely lead to an eviction?\n",

      "selftext": "Some things altered for anonymity but tl;dr formerly friendly stepchild became hostile towards me after marriage leading me to divorce and has now apologzed for their behavior which I accept and am now ignoring and the people I trust in my life are making me question myself.\n\nI (36f/widow) had been in a relationship with my stbxh since 2019. I lost my first husband in 2012 to a drunk driver. My stbxh (40m) wasn't my first relationship after that loss but obviously we married so it had been the best. He is primary parent, his ex-wife (divorced since SC/17 was a toddler) had a custody plan but neither of them stuck to the schedule because they honored what SC wanted, which was mostly staying with dad. I was a friend to SC and we got along. SC would call me to chat, ask to go places with me and we even had harmless inside jokes (that I did always explain to my husband) and I was happy. The relationship cooled off as SC got older and grew more independent but still friendly and reliable. We got married in 2022 and I would say things changed dramatically then.\n\nI remember SC clinging to my husband and giving me the shortest answers possible. If I got up from the sofa beside husband, SC would take that spot. If I said hey I was sitting there, both dismissed me saying I could sit elsewhere no biggie. Then the complaints about my cooking when there weren't issues before and how their mom makes food, and it did lead to fights where husband would just get something ordered that SC likes. I did address these little things with my husband and he said to just leave it alone because SC is adjusting to such a life change. But I'd been living in his house since 2020, I'm not new. They escalated and soon SC said they didn't feel safe with how I drove and refused to get into the car if I was driving and my husband got frustrated at me. Inside jokes were gone and SC yelled that they don't keep secret from their dad. If I was so much as walked into the same room I'd get \"are you fucking serious?\" and such. But if I left the house sometimes SC would call my husband sobbing about being scared and alone in the house. I couldn't win. Then SC decided to live with their mom last year saying that they felt unsafe, unwanted and ignored. Not going to lie, I felt relief. But my husband came after me asking what did I do? I must have done something. How could I make SC feel that way? I tried talking to him, tried talking to SC, neither wanted therapy and when I got a phone call from his ex wife yelling at me that I'm a monster and she's taking my husband to court, I knew I had to go before something bad happened to me. I left months ago and filed for divorce which just pissed off the parents even more as if it was proof and was accused of running away.\n\nI very much regret selling my house. I'm currently in apartments that are nice but I'm not used to hearing stomps above my head. I got a text from former SC saying they're sorry they were mean to me. They had always hoped that their parents would get back together. Their friends hate their step parents and they were scared I was going to turn out bad too. They hate seeing their dad crying about another failed marriage. They're scared their dad isn't ok (I blocked him). I said that what they did was very hurtful, thanked them for recognizing their behavior and hoped them well in life. Then I blocked SC. I'm fucking done. A whole confusing year I endured something I didn't cause and was made to feel like it was my fault because no one except a child understood what was going on.\n\nI showed the texts to my friends and family who helped me during that time. I had been so damn scared that I was going to be arrested for something I never did and while I'm honestly angry at SC for everything they did, I can recognize they're a kid. One who knew better but I was in a scary position and I am angry. So I was at least very relieved to have proof. My mom said I should unblock SC and not punish them further because the guilt pushed them to reach out to me. My dad and siblings are on my side saying I don't owe them anything else. A few friends said I can't walk away from a hurting kid like that and SC was confused too. So I'm sitting here, again confused, and the only thing I can do is sit here confused. So impartial people please help.",

So the first time I take it to work, on the way home the clutch goes out ( it\u2019s a 6 speed manual) now ive driven manuals before and have known how to drive them for years. However I\u2019ve never had a clutch go out in the car before so I might\u2019ve over driven it, once I couldn\u2019t get the gears engaged I pulled over. That night she got the car towed to the dealership. After the car got back from the mechanic she let me know I owed her close to 4,000 on a 6,000 bill she said she was willing to pay for the clutch but because I drove it after the fact the flywheel got a hole punched into it and I had to pay for that. Now when replacing a clutch the flywheel has to be resurfaced or replaced each time so the cost  wouldn\u2019t have been that much different regardless. I have heard family and friends telling me it unfair to pay for something that wasn\u2019t my fault almost like if it happened in a rental car\nNow my aunt says I shouldn\u2019t have borrowed it if I couldn\u2019t afford to fix it (my first mistake lol)\nHowever a few other things to add my aunt makes over 6figures and I have a part time l, minimum wage job. I started a comprise for her and was willing to go to other mechanics and get an average cost for all of it and pay half but she told me she paid what she paid and that me not paying makes me a shitty person\nNote a no point did I say I wouldn\u2019t pay and at no point did I not take accountability for the things I caused. \nShe\u2019s just stubborn and is unwilling to compromise with me and told me to fuck off after I brought this idea forward \nAITAH?",

He was texting me and then stopped at like 9pm, I drove to his house the next night and something just told me that he had went somewhere that I don\u2019t like (I\u2019m pretty sure you can guess where), he unshared his location with me and told me he didn\u2019t know where he was going and that it was his cousin who took him there (I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, only recently that there\u2019s no way he couldn\u2019t have known cause he remembered to unshare his location and those places usually have signage. If he realized this and left as soon as he noticed is unknown to me but I guess it doesn\u2019t matter now). My dilemma is that after that happened I asked him to not hangout with that cousin for a while so we could rebuild trust in our relationship and I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it reoccurring. Well now, he\u2019s going to hangout with all of his cousins, with the cousin in question possibly going to be there too. I told him I don\u2019t want him to hangout with any of his male cousins, but he swears it was only the one cousin who took him to that place, and that it won\u2019t happen again. And it hasn\u2019t happened again, but knowing that he might be hanging out with that cousin again concerns me and I feel really hurt that he doesn\u2019t understand my concern or that even after all this time it still bothers me. I don\u2019t want to be that gf that tells him he can\u2019t hangout with his family, but I don\u2019t like that cousin and I don\u2019t like that I\u2019m expected to just ignore my concerns and worries at his expense. I don\u2019t want to breakup but he\u2019s making it sound like it\u2019s an ultimatum, I either just ignore how I feel and he hangs out with them or we breakup. What do I do? How do I make him understand that this still bothers me? Is the only option to breakup? Other than this we\u2019ve been doing super good lately, and my own anxiety and insecurities aside, I think he loves me and I would hate for this to be the reason we breakup. ",

      "selftext": "I currently heavily rely on them when it comes to finances, they pay for college through the GI Bill, and most other things, so that I can focus on school. My gf\u2019s (19F) family is moving to a new state. The local college has a much higher standing than the one I currently attend (like top 100 nationally ranked), and would provide more opportunities than the college I currently attend. My parents are the type of people to constantly drill family into my head and ignore what I say. I often feel selfish for wanting to be myself or be independent, my mom is also not accepting of my sexuality. I wouldn\u2019t consider moving schools if I was going to be worse off, but I worry my parents will only see it as me trying to get away from them and follow my gf and her family.\n\nI should mention that my brother (20M) transferred from out of state to and in state college and lives with my parents again. I would be transferring from in state to an out of state college. I don\u2019t live with my parents, but they have my cat who I worry about. They don\u2019t have a problem with transferring, but my brother is more family oriented, and I prefer my freedom and independence. I want to pursue my goals without constantly second guessing because my parents want me to stay close to them.\n\nAnother thing about my parents is just generally the difference in how they treat me versus my brother. He failed his last semester before transferring home, I, on the other hand, have kept straight A\u2019s, I\u2019m involved in school, I\u2019m in the highest distinction of the honors program, and I\u2019m treated like I can\u2019t take care of myself. I\u2019m talked down to no matter what I do. Some examples of this would be when I was sick, I got a doctor\u2019s and was excused from most of my classes except one, but when I brought it up, I got lectured to email the teacher (which I did), send a copy of the note (which I did), and go see the attendance office (while I was sick). Multiple times I told them the absence wasn\u2019t a big deal, didn\u2019t affect my grade, etc., but they just kept going. Another time, my friends from town visited for the weekend because my birthday was that coming Tuesday. We watched horror movies, and just hung out, however, when Tuesday rolled around I was on the phone with my mom, and she not only insulted the gift my gf got me, but she also made me feel bad for spending time with my friends and watching movies because often I\u2019m busy with homework, so she said something along the lines of \u201coh I thought you were busy, why would you spend time watching movies\u201d in a nasty tone. There are other instances, I don\u2019t call my parents very often because I\u2019m made to feel bad constantly, but I worry that a lot of what I\u2019m doing is my own fault, though I never feel like I can do anything right either. Also, when I talk to my parents about where I want to go for vet school, neither of them ever listen. They always ask me where I want to go, even though I\u2019ve repeatedly told them and why, they want me to go to an in state vet school, but that\u2019s not what I want, and I\u2019ve said so. During a recent conversation with my mom, she brought up going in state because she has a benefit that only applies to an in state college, I told her no, I\u2019m going to apply wherever I want and choose the best option. Just generally, it doesn\u2019t feel like my parents listen to what I want, no matter how clear I am about it.\n\nI fear that if I choose to go through with the application process for transferring, there would be a big blow out with my parents. I worry about being able to take my cat with me, but other than that, I would be willing to give up pretty much anything else. I also worry about being able to pay for college without my parents financial support, I would be fine getting a job, but college is still expensive and the degree I\u2019m pursuing requires a lot of schooling. I could probably achieve what I want in the school that I\u2019m at, but I fear being miserable staying close to my family and generally feeling trapped because I\u2019m so dependent on them.\n\nI can clarify anything is need be, I\u2019m probably forgetting things. I worry that my viewpoint is skewed, but other people have overheard phone calls with my parents and also realized how they talk to me. Any advice I would appreciate, I want to be civil with them as I\u2019m not really an argumentative person, but I realize as time goes on, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in control of my life.",

      "selftext": "In the 8 of December evening I just did something wrong. I put a pack of antihistamines to my aunties drawers to kake a point.  (EDIT: this is bad english and I'm not from the states, so I'm adding more context.) \n\nim 21 F with my aunt who is 35 F. Long story short we had an argument regarding antihistamines aka the pill you take when you\u2019re itching badly. \n\nshe basically said that she needed it but sonce she ate something last last night that made it so bad. I told her i didnt have it anymore. it was months now when i last saw it. \n\n\nto explain that part, basically there was a restaurant that my aunt and her friend visiting us from australia that were going to, and I was feeling rather itchy those few months ago.  \n\nI couldn\u2019t remember much, but all I knew was that I was given antihistamines. since it was a really specified what I needed to take I just took the entire thing, but it was said that  this friend of her needed that antihistamine so I eventually tried to give it back to him. \n\nSince I didn\u2019t realize that I finally remembered why it was still with me was because he told me \"I can keep it\" or some sorts. It was a very long time ago, so I really couldn\u2019t remember the whole details. \n\nWe basically had an argument regarding that one. \n\nThis part will be very important because I remembered being upset, but just defending the fact that I do remember giving it to him, and I had a lot of pride in my opinion at least for that time. \n\nThe lead on after we finally got to church  (we were going to the church at that time) she told me again how forgetful I was and that I need to stop. \n\nIt was a fair point because I always forget. I won\u2019t lie about. Although if I were going to defend myself, and wish I could say it to her, I\u2019d say I was battling with some mental illness that I have yet to go to a doctor for. I suspect I have ADHD or CPTSD. But this is another topic. \n\nLong story short  I\u2019m still petty with her that time that I really didn\u2019t want to talk. I got a bit sassy when she asked me if I can drink water and I just told her \u201cno I\u2019m fine to not drink water.\u201d sarcastically. Needless to say that made her not wanna go sit next to me. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an asshole mover or what but feel free to grill me on this one. \n\n\nThen there\u2019s me doing the petty part. We were still basically not OK. \n\nI remember that I had to ride her car home and she took off after that. \n\n\nsince then, I accidentally found the antihistamines that she was looking for and then I remembered what really happened\n\n\n\nSince I was sincerely tired of trying to make a point yet never win at any arguement, being that I am younger than her she helped me out get to another country, she got me a job at her second job, she\u2019s the one that did a lot of things for me, the odds were just stacked. I always was said the things i needed to improve on, but the delivery to me always wasn't the best sounding. I had enough... I had to do turn things around. I did turn them around. Why was it never enough?? So if I can't do something, then I just had to make it look like I was in the right for once. \n\nI guess I had it coming. \n\nSo what did I do? I tried to put those antihistamines just to make it look like that. She was in the wrong. \n\nLater that night, she was so pissed. She finally lashed out. She said that her patient was on the roof. she said that she\u2019ll call my parents and tell me all of the wrong things that I did when I was in a different place, which is now. \n\nShe definitely remembers where she places her stuff, which is surprising because ironically, she does tell me that she misplaced an item, but it was one time after all.\n\nBut then again, she is tired to do stuff on her own.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know. \n\nBasically, I was told that we\u2019ll see if I\u2019ll survive out here without her help. \n\nAnd honestly felt numb. I feel bad. I know all the sacrifices that she did. If anything it is beyond dollars for me to repay her. Now she doesn\u2019t really wanna talk to me at all or go near me. \n\nI have regrets but I don\u2019t know what is in this situation. \n\nI wonder what will I do right now? Truly I am grateful to be here. I always tell that to myself. I do suck at reciprocation. \n",

I made the plan to invite his family over in the morning before work, cook a Christmas dinner and when he went to work on the evening. I was going to go to my moms and spend the evening there with my baby (she is having Christmas dinner with my brother but they want the evening alone as a family) \n\nMy partner has just informed me after telling me for 6 months he would be working Christmas that he\u2019s managed to get it off.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets tricky, him and my mom do not get along, I don\u2019t really understand why, my mom likes him but my partner doesn\u2019t like her, she is very warm to him and recently bought him loads for his birthday but he\u2019s just never taken to her. He always says he will spend the day at hers with me but cancels last minute, my mom cooked a big dinner not long ago and he cancelled 10 minutes before, my mom in anger told me he wasn\u2019t welcome anymore but later apologised. He hasn\u2019t seen her since.\n\nI said to my partner that I will still be seeing my mom Christmas evening as that was the original plan and otherwise she will be alone Christmas evening.

He has since gone in a mood saying how he managed to get it off (which I didn\u2019t know until today) and said how he\u2019s going to work Christmas Day after all (all because I\u2019d be seeing my mom for a few hours whilst he would be at our house with his family who I am cooking for) \n\nI think he\u2019s wrong, he thinks I\u2019m wrong, \nWho is the asshole here please?

He never wanted a sibling and made it very obvious for our entire childhoods. Him and his friends would play mean pranks on me. Make me seek during hide and seek and while i was counting fully leave the house, locking me in the bathroom, and even once leaving dog poop in my shoe. I was miserable growing up and my parents did nothing. Anyway, as we grew up and he moved out we didn't see eachother or talk except for holidays. Now we get to the problem. This Thanksgiving, we were all back at my mom's house for dinner. The plan was we all stay with her for the week (it's a big house). On saturday, my brother thought it would be a good idea to climb up a ladder to try to hang some christmas lights from the roof of our mom's house. He was on the ladder when he decided to pretend to fall off the ladder as a joke. I was holding the ladder under him, but the force of him shaking it from up high made my grip slip for a second, and he fell. He hit the ground hard and he was bleeding all over and definitely had a broken arm. He asked me to call the ambulance but I didn't. Ambulances are usually upwards of a thousand dollars and I knew he would somehow put the charge on my card. I called my aunt over and we lifted him into his car. The whole ride over, he was yelling at me for not calling him an ambulance when he needed one. He was calling me names as i drove him to the hospital. As soon as I knew he was safe I went back to our mom's house, got my car, and drove 2 hours back to my house. At that point I was so tired of my family I couldn't bear it. I slept peacefully in my own bed but when I woke up I had a ton of missed calls. They were all my family berratting me for not calling the ambulance for him. Apparently his blood got on the seats of his car and it's going to be an arm and a leg to get it out. He is trying to make me pay but I won't. It is not my fault he fell. But my whole family is acting like it is. Everyday I am getting more and more threats and harassment from my family to pay off his medical bills and the money to fix his car. Should I pay it?

      "selftext": "I ( M41) had a massive crush back in high school ( Dannie F46). She is the sister of another kid in school. I was maybe 15 at the time. Throughout the years, I saw her occasionally and thought she gave off goddess vibes. I didn't see her in years until she walked into my office. I finally learned more about her. The service she was looking for was best suited for another colleague, so I pointed her in the right direction. Age looks beautiful on her. I spent months hoping to hear back from her, until we ran into each other at the supermarket. We built a good friendship after that. I was surprised to hear that she had an abusive marriage. She's a mom and was very single. Our friendship is nothing I've experienced before. She's not afraid to be goofy or laughing hard. She doesn't run away if I show up and her hair is not \u201cdone\u201d. Honestly, I'm grateful and appreciate being able to get to know her as a person rather than the \u201csmall town celebrity\u201d that I had in my head.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, she started taking naps on my lap. I know this is extremely personal and requires trust. I don't make moves unless I'm invited because I would hate being rejected. So, what follows is a bit confusing.\n\nWe both have demanding careers and are parents, but we see each other at least 4 times a week and call each other everyday no matter what. I look forward to this and so does she ( her own words). We always do Friday night at a restaurant, and we don't clarify when people mistake us for a married couple. I'm proud to be with her and I admire her for having overcome very bad moments in life. \n\nLast Friday, we went out and ended up at my place. We shared a kiss and she was super nervous. I asked her if she wanted to stop but she said no and sat on my lap. One thing led to another and we ended up having sex. I had never seen a woman squirt ( she did a little). After we finished and were relaxing, I said that I loved her and she said she felt the same but started crying. She said she was gonna be okay but she looked teary eyed. \n\nWe've maintained the same rate of calls and texting, but I'm a bit worried. Did I fuck up by saying the L word? I think maybe she's embarrassed about the squirt? I'm coming here because I'd like to hear opinions and any advice to help her feel secure and comfortable. As background, Dannie has a history of abandonment. While pregnant, her ex-husband decided to go on a road trip and kept pushing his return date, then he cheated and married AP who's now in jail for fraud. She also has a history of men harassing her \u201cbecause she is pretty\u201d which caused her to be a little avoidant and to hate showing skin.\n\nAitah?\n\n\nEdit: for grammar.\n",

      "selftext": "I (28M) am married to my wife (27F). We have been together for approximately 5 years, married for 2, living together for 4. Since we have been living together, she has repeatedly gotten frustrated or mad at me for not waking her up in the mornings on the weekend when she sleeps in and I got up before her. (to clarify, she does not have any commitments like work or school on the weekend)\n\nFor example, I get up around 8am to start my day. Eat breakfast and catch up on work emails. She will have alarms set for 8am, 9am, and sometimes others in between or after but will rarely get up with me. Although she set alarms, she does not always get up when they go off. She will often snooze or turn off the alarm and fall back asleep. When she snoozes or turns off the alarms, she will likely sleep in until 10:30 or even 11:00am. When she finally gets up and sees the time, she is mad that she has wasted her morning sleeping.  Because of this, she has asked me to take a moment to gently check in on her in the mornings to try and wake her after hearing her alarms snoozed. I have agreed to do this when I can, but clarified that she should not rely on me as an alarm clock as I am sometimes preoccupied with what I am doing and loose track of time. My issue is that she gets mad at me for the times I loose track of time and let her sleep in. \n\nI think it is also worth mentioning that she is not a morning person (neither am I, and cant blame her), but my gentle wakeup calls are not always welcomed with appreciation as she is normally grumpy and does not want to get up. \n\nThis morning, I lost track of time while catching up on work stuff and let her sleep in until 11:00am. When she woke, she was mad at me. This frustrated me because I did not feel it was fair to be held accountable for her sleeping in. \n\nShe argues that she often hits snooze or disables her alarm in her sleep and she cannot control sleeping in at times. However, she has work hours from 7am to 4pm and gets up on time every day for this consistently without any help from me (I can fortunately sleep in a little longer before work). Regardless of her snoozing her alarm in her sleep, I feel that if she wants to get up by a certain time in the morning, it is within her control and is her responsibility to  provider herself with the means to do so and not rely on me to do so for her. I do not have a problem with helping wake her up occasionally, however also do not feel it is fair to be put at fault for her sleeping in if I fail to do so.\n\nSo AITAH for not waking up my wife in the morning?",

Anyway, I planned a surprise dinner for our two year anniversary because he\u2019s been working so hard these last few months and I wanted to do something nice for a change. I booked us in for 8pm at a Premier Inn (his fav) because I thought that it would give him enough time to get there (he finishes work at 5pm and would take 10-15 mins for him to get there). But he called me at 7:55pm to say he got held up at work and had to help the new girl let\u2019s call her Mia, I asked how long he was going to be (I was willing to wait until 10pm) he said he don\u2019t think he could make it until 9:30pm. I said that\u2019s fine and during that time I looked up this girl turns out she\u2019s not new she\u2019s been there for 4 months. It got to 9:31pm and I gave up I text him to say I\u2019m going home I\u2019ll see him later (I also gave the restaurant his card number and ate starter, dinner, dessert and a bottle of wine \ud83d\ude09). He text me saying he was going to be 5 mins but I left him on read and went to bed. Fast forward 2 months I\u2019ve heard from him to say he was sorry I said we needed some space and haven\u2019t heard from him since but I did meet up with this girl in a Starbucks and she was pregnant so I let her go infront of me, she was very thankful. She gave her name and her name by coincidence was MIA. She sat down at a table and after I got my coffee I asked if I could sit with her (she looked upset). We got talking turns out she\u2019s 5 months along and she works at the same place my boyfriend does I asked if she was seeing anyone and she said HIS NAME. I asked how long they\u2019ve been together she said he asked her out once she was pregnant and they met through work on a night out DRUNK. So I think I did the right thing ditching him.",

Our marriage is completely over since he slept with half the town, kicked me and our daughter out the house and we became homeless. There was no contact for about 8 months until I sued him for custody of our child. We settled for 48/52 since I needed help raising a child and I refuse to let my daughter grow up without a dad. I also got child support and currently trying to get alimony. My daughter and I are 100% happy and doing better than great. Got a house, a life, a great job. But her father and I don\u2019t communicate. I don\u2019t care about his life, as we both moved on but when it comes to our daughter I would like communication. I do understand that when my daughter is at his house, it\u2019s his rules. But for some reason he doesn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s my house my rules. For example that recently happened today. My daughter got scratched by my cat. I did let him know that it\u2019s a learning process for both the cat and my daughter, who is 2, that they need to be civil. Majority of the time, Both my daughter and cat play, cuddle, everything is nice. But sometime as a toddler she\u2019s absolutely CRAZY. she\u2019s loud, she hits, she\u2019s fast, she dances and dead weights her body onto the cat for a hug. They been together since my daughter was born and this cat is about 5 years old, she\u2019s gotten used to my daughter but sometimes sh!t happens. I do get upset at her and teach her that we need to be calm and have nice hands or the cat will scratch you. Which, she did get a scratch on her nose. My daughter laughed it off and continued her day and I took it as a learning opportunity. Day goes on and now her dad is yelling at me for allowing her to be near the cat. And he tells me that at his house he has two cats and his other two kids and our daughter are not allowed near the cats because of similar issues like this one. He\u2019s making me feel like a bad parent for allowing our daughter to near her cat and getting scratched asking if I ever watch her.  He never communicates over important issues and when he does it\u2019s always an augment. I don\u2019t condone it, I don\u2019t wanna play his games so I left him on read. Mainly because what I\u2019ll say won\u2019t matter to him. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong about the cat. But I feel like my child should have a pet and not to be hidden. AITAH. ",

      "selftext": "Hi. First time poster. Please pardon me if my post is not worded correctly, English is my second language.\n\nI am a 31 f (leesa) subleased a room from current tenats (3 other females - sandy, Hanah, nancy) (all the names here are just made up for this story) in a semidetached house with basement occupied by other small family. Lease starts from August to April - 8 months. \n\nHanah and Nancy are sisters but Sandy was their previous roommate who decided to lease the current house along with previous tenant (Amari). I leased in place of Amari. I live in a area where winters could be harsh and cleaning off the snow from car could be hectic. So I have looked for places which offers enclosed parking and found the current place. I have explicitly communicated with them in texts and also in lease stating that i am paying extra 50$ bucks for enclosed parking space which is garage. \n\nAll of us including downstairs family have 3 cars, but the house has just 1 garage and huge parking space which can fit 3 cars in L-shape in front of the house. But to access that garage, cars should be moved. I know what i signed up for when i have signed the lease that, it is a lot of coordination to move the cars around.\n\nNow for the 3 cars, 1 is mine, one belongs to downstairs family and other car belongs to Sandy. When i moved into the place, I have asked sandy for the garage fob and she asked my office timings (i work from home 2 days a week and have to go to office other 3 days). I have said its a mobile work type and would be taking my car out daily for my gym even on days i dont go to office. She has asked/said that to park my car in the open parking space for few days and she would be parking in garage as she has plans to go to vacation in august for 15 days. I said i am fine with it, as its summer and i dont have to deal with snow.\n\nSo all these 3 months i have just parked outside as i dont want to bother people to move their cars everyday even though i paid 50$ extra for parking. Now the winter has approached and it started to snow. Couple days back I have took the garage fob from common place and mentioned in our group chat that i will be using garage to park my car from now on (since Tuesday). Sandy has replied in the chat saying that i need to inform her everytime i move my car and i agreed. So its been 3 days since i started parking my car in garage and moving it out by telling them prior. On Thursday evening i gave headsup to both neighbor and sandy, that i ll be moving car on friday morning. So on Friday, i have texted them asking to move their cars to park mine inside and it went fine. \n\nOn Saturday, as its weekend, i have plans to go out and meet my friends. I see sandy is cooking inside and on a call. I asked her to move the car and she just looked at me and moved the car (without uttering a single word and displeasure on her face). I can see she is bothered and i understand. As i am not responsible for her feelings, i left her to be without saying anything. When i have returned back, i texted her to move her car she said she will come in 2 mins after changing in chat and immediately called me complaining that I cannot ask her to move the car 100 times in a day and should give her enough notice to move. I tried explaining her that its disrespectful to say to others you are moving it 100 times even though you are just moving it twice in a day. I also said her that i could have just parked in the open parking space if she feels unwell or lazy to move her car. She in turn blamed me saying that i am picking a fight with her and cut my call. I was furious at this point, even though i paid additional money for the parking, i was blocked the entry to my parking spot??! I have conveyed how i felt in the group chat and she responed with crying smiley to my message and said same things that i need to give her notice and again stopped responding to the chat. I waited till morning to here something from her to see her thoughts. It is her usual behaviour that whenever people confront her, she would just ignore the chat. So i wanted to take matters into my own hands and sent offical notice in email to my current owners (who are sandy, hanah and nancy) to return my 200$ back or i will be going to sue them with evidence of our chats, money sent, and mainly signed lease). \n\nIn all of this ordeal, eventhough sandy is being sandy, hanah and nancy were very kind hearted people. And would always take their roommates responsibilities seriously and wouldnt cause any problems. In addition to being a pain in the neck, sandy doesnt stick to schedule! When i have planned a cleaning schedule (as they dont have one) and asked in group chat if they are ok with the cleaning schedule hanah and nancy have replied but sandy ignored the texts. On top of which, she has sweeped the house deliberately that week (she didnot even cleaned kitchen scraps or garbage or shared washroom, lol).Initially When i have moved into this room, the shared washroom (me and sandy) has lots of hair in the drain and looks visibly blocked. As i had my share of bad experiences from old roommates, i decided to bring my own hair strainer for bath tub and kept using it. Sandy has the audacity to ask me clean the bath tub with the clogged hair. After a heated argument, i cleaned the bath tub after which she cleaned the blocked drain. (Funny thing is, there are no cleaning supplies to bleach the tub, but she claims that she cleaned it after i moved). Also have not seen her clean her own unwashed dishes for days, spoiled food on stove for weeks and so on.. Hannah would be proactive to clean the common areas so i decided to move on and help around wherever i could. \n\nBlocking entry to my paid parking is my last straw of patience. After sending official email to all tenants, i want to proceed legally and sue for the amount i paid and damages. My only concern here is, hanah and nancy would be dragged into this (as they are in lease agreement too) even though they are good people. Hanah has her fare share of similar incidents with sandy and we are all tired.. \n\nWith some other incidents, we all decided to break the lease by December end in October and owner has agreed to that. \n\nNow Should I just leave this and suck up for another 20 days and vacate (which also helps hanah and nancy?) or should i just proceed with it and sue them (mainly sandy, but she will sure drag other 2 in to the fight)? \nOr am i overreacting to this whole situation! \n\nThanks for reading and really appreciate to hear your thoughts \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffb\n\nSandy is 25f, Hannah is 23f, and Nancy is 20f.",

Among other issues. On a lot of these occasions they\u2019ll actually have live bands come perform. \n\nThese are not big houses, it\u2019s a dense inner city Phoenix suburb with about 12 feet of space between the houses. Last night I\u2019d just sort of had it with the situation because my wife works at 5am and the music was so loud that it was buzzing my windows/ furniture and keeping her up. So around 10pm (10:04pm) I went and knocked on their door and tried to speak to them. The man next door immediately got extremely aggressive telling me to call the cops if I want to and know that he knows I\u2019m complaining he\u2019s going to start complaining too, whatever that means, told me to get the fuck off of his property, got in my face putting his hands in my face, just truly unhinged about it. I recorded audio of all of this from my pocket. \n\nI\u2019m wondering though- am I crazy? Like is it just not socially acceptable to ask your neighbors to be respectful of others in extreme circumstances like this? Should I not have knocked on their door? \n\nI\u2019m also really concerned about them retaliating and maybe like messing with our cars or breaking a window or just any sort of generally crazy response. Given these circumstances should I report them to the HOA? I don\u2019t know for sure but I can\u2019t imagine all of this doesn\u2019t violate the CCRs somehow. Even if it does, and even if the HOA contacts them will that just make it worse? I\u2019m lost and borderline concerned for our safety after this encounter. Thanks for reading ",

They\u2019d call, I\u2019d break out all down my back from a 30 minute conversation, they\u2019d send a paragraph of a text, and before I even opened it, just seeing the sender my arm would start breaking out. At one point I thought maybe I had gotten passed it, cause I made it through a hour long video call without anything on my body, till I looked at a mirror and realized my face was swollen and my eyes lids had hives patches on them. \n\nI was supposed to go to family Christmas again this year, but I told them that I had been experiencing some health issues and that my doctors didn\u2019t think it would be wise for me to travel for Christmas. (Which\u2026isn\u2019t untrue, pcp and therapist both think this is an extreme response to stress and I need to avoid the stress they bring.) \n\nThe current plan is to send them a video of me clearly explaining my boundaries, what will happen if they break them, and why I\u2019m having to set these boundaries. I\u2019m doing a video over a text or call so that they can have time to absorb and process before needing to respond, while also showing it is actually me saying these things, so they don\u2019t blame it on my husband or misinterpret my tone through a text.\n\nHere is my question; do I tell them my boundaries before or after their family Christmas? There will be 9 people in the Airbnb for a week, 6 of which I don\u2019t have an issue with. But it seems like it might be harder for my mother to manipulate the other 6 against me if she doesn\u2019t knows this in advance. At the same time, I don\u2019t want to have this weight over me during my holiday celebrations with my husband. \n\nSo\u2026would I be the asshole if I went no contact before the holiday? Anyone with experience going no contact have advice?\n\nTLDR: my parents and sister are so stressful they literally give me hives to interact with, so I\u2019m going no contact. But would I be the asshole if I sent that message before the holidays and ruined family Christmas just so it isn\u2019t hanging over my head?  ",

      "selftext": "\nMy ex wife (25f) is purposely trying to keep our three kids from me (26m)\nMy wife and I are currently separated, as I moved out almost 4 weeks ago. I moved into my parents house, and she still lives in the condo I pay for, with our kids. \n\nThe reasons I left are numerous - She has a litany of mental health issues including PTSD, anxiety and depression. Over the last five years of our marriage, she spent so much time in bed, needed so much from me just to get through the day- meanwhile I worked and struggled to provide. Especially the last month of our marriage, I was doing almost everything- she didn't hardly get out of bed for almost 4 weeks after she had our son. Eventually I just couldn\u2019t handle the pressure anymore of being everything to everyone. Having three kids under three and a half, working full time, and then coming home to deal with her and her insecurities and depression - took a toll on me and I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. \n\nSince then, she has been refusing to let me keep the kids overnight. She says they\u2019re \u201ctoo young\u201d and that it\u2019s unreasonable to send them overnight because she nurses the younger two and can\u2019t pump enough. \nBut the week after I moved out, she went to an inpatient mental facility for five days, and I had all three kids during that time she was gone. Our 3.5 and 2 year old did great- they are ecstatic to see me every time! Our baby also was great and took a bottle and drank the milk she was pumping and sending to us. She made enough milk for him for the whole 5 days. She says she won\u2019t let me give him formula, but if we didn\u2019t have enough breast milk, I\u2019m confident he would drink that too. I deeply care for my children and will do anything to have time with them. \n\nShe\u2019s insisting that I can only have our son (the baby) for 4 hours on the days I see the children- which is only three days a week, and no overnights. I\u2019ve said I could take them from Saturday night until Tuesday mornings, since I don\u2019t work Sunday and Monday. She refuses, saying \u201cthey\u2019re too little\u201d, and only letting me take the baby for 4 hours each of those days. Again, our son is almost 2 months old, and has taken a bottle from me for much longer than this time frame. It\u2019s clear that her issue isn\u2019t with what\u2019s best for the children, but to get back at me for leaving her. \n\nNow, she\u2019s telling me I can\u2019t come into our house- which, mind you, I still pay for- when I come to get the kids. That she doesn\u2019t want any contact with me and she will have someone take the kids outside to me when I arrive. I told her that\u2019s not happening- it\u2019s my house. I have every right to come into it. \n\nThis morning, when I arrived to pick up the children, she came downstairs and told me that, as they had not woken up yet, I had to leave. I told her I would be waking them up at 9:30, because she lets them sleep too late anyway. She called her dad, who lives nearby, to come over, and he started telling me I needed to get out of my house. Then she called the police on me, tells them that I \u201ccome in without asking\u201d and \u201cwont leave\u201d. She even goes on to tell\nhim how unsafe and threatened she feels by me, which is her new go-to since I left- suddenly now\nI was \u201cabusive\u201d and \u201ccontrolling\u201d. (Funny how she only says that now that I\u2019ve left.)\n\nI\u2019m filing for divorce this weekend.\nAITA in this divorce? ",

We've been together for five years, and everything is going great \u2014 except for one thing: my relationship with my mom.\n\nMy mom, Elaine (55F), has always been a bit critical and overbearing, but it\u2019s become worse since I started dating Sarah. Sarah and I are very different in many ways \u2014 culturally, socially, and even politically. My mom has made it clear that she doesn't approve of Sarah, and over the years, she\u2019s said some pretty hurtful things to her. At first, Sarah would try to be polite, but after a while, the comments started affecting her self-esteem. My mom has called her \"too different\" for me, criticized her appearance, and made comments about how she thinks Sarah\u2019s not \"good enough\" for me.\n\nI\u2019ve had several talks with my mom, asking her to stop being rude to Sarah and to respect our relationship. Every time, she promises she\u2019ll try, but it always ends the same \u2014 my mom subtly insulting Sarah or treating her like she\u2019s inferior. A few weeks ago, during a family dinner, Sarah finally snapped and told my mom that she wouldn\u2019t tolerate being disrespected anymore. My mom got really offended and accused Sarah of being too sensitive.\n\nThis brings me to the wedding. I\u2019ve been planning it for months, and I\u2019ve been trying to keep the peace, but I\u2019ve made it clear to my mom that if she can\u2019t respect Sarah, she won\u2019t be invited to the wedding. I told her that I\u2019m not going to put Sarah through the stress of having someone who\u2019s constantly rude to her at our wedding day. My mom is absolutely furious. She\u2019s saying I\u2019m choosing Sarah over my own family and that it\u2019s my responsibility to \"fix things\" between them. She\u2019s now threatening to not attend the wedding at all, saying that if I go through with this decision, she\u2019ll \"never forgive me.\"\n\nSo, AITA for not inviting my mom to my wedding because she can\u2019t respect my fianc\u00e9e?",

      "selftext": "(LONG POST WARNING) I (24f) have been friends with this girl (also 24f) for almost four years now. We met online because of a shared passion for a certain genre of music/several of the same bands and are semi long distance, living in bordering states about 4-5 hours apart. We\u2019ve met up in person quite a few times for concerts and conventions and have traveled together. My friend is obsessed with concerts and traveling, as am I, and our favorite bands don\u2019t come to where she lives while they do frequently come to a city closer to me, so she does have to travel a lot for shows and does so very often, not only to my city but wherever her favorite groups are playing, particularly her all time favorite band she follows everywhere. She has seen them 14 times and already has a ticket to see them next year. \n\nHowever, she is 24 and has never had a real job, not even fast food. (by real job I mean anything you have to submit your SSN for.) She pet sits and house sits for a few families in her neighborhood occasionally, has done freelance \u201cwork\u201d for her family\u2019s business she has no interest in pursuing as a career because she would have to put in effort (her words, not mine.) All of her resume \u201cwork\u201d experiences are just orgs she signed up for in college. She graduated with a digital marketing degree in 2023 and it seems like she just expected a job would fall into her lap with a bachelor\u2019s, despite never doing any sort of job or internship to gain experience (because it would have taken away her ability to do out of state concerts.) She also has told me she doesn\u2019t want to get a full time job because her life right now is so flexible and she gets paid (albeit not that much, I don\u2019t know how exactly much she makes but I know it\u2019s less than 500 a week or $25k/year) to sit around and eat other people\u2019s food and watch Youtube. \n\nShe is in a decent amount of credit card debt from her trips and has borrowed money from her dad to pay for things in college although he has put his foot down more after she graduated and doesn\u2019t give her as much nowadays. She and I were on the phone recently as she was congratulating me on starting a new job with a significant raise this month, and she started talking about potential career opportunities she could do. I was excited she had ideas, but every single one was \u201cwell, I guess not because that\u2019s too hard/I\u2019d need a long training period for that/or to go back to school.\u201d \n\nShe then went on to reiterate that she wasn\u2019t sure about even getting a regular 9-5 office job in her field because she wouldn\u2019t have very much PTO starting out and her number one priority in 2025 is seeing her band as many times as she possibly can, and that she was thinking about getting a remote job instead. I know I should have expected it from her, but I was legitimately shocked. I told her that not only does it show me how out of touch she is with reality since all my friends with remote jobs work way more than I do and have to take the same amount of PTO, and that she has gone way beyond being a fangirl and is prioritizing this band over her future, and sooner or later they won\u2019t be active at all anymore and in 5 or 10 years she\u2019ll be left at home making next to no money and mooching off of her aging parents, floundering to get new pet sitting clients if and when the neighborhood families move and their pets start to pass away. She looked at me like I had just kicked her dog in the face and hung up on me and hasn\u2019t texted me since. I don\u2019t think I said anything offensive but clearly her family isn\u2019t having these conversations in a way that\u2019ll get thru to her. AITAH? ",

      "selftext": "So my sister and her husband have 2 kids. One a little over 2, and the other about 6 months old. We all live together and pay bills together,and they're great loving parents, I've seen it, but most days it seems they have far too much of an anger issue towards their kids very normal behavior. The kind of behaviour I'm talking about is: crying, interrupting what you're doing because they want to climb on you/play with you, waking up in the middle of the night upset, and generally being a naive child who isn't following direct clear orders all the time. \n\nI've watched the dad tell the 6 month old baby to \"shut the fuck up\" on multiple occasions(feels like daily) and with such an \"I'm so fucking over this\" look on his face. I've watched him stare death daggers at her as well when she wouldn't go to sleep because he wants to sleep or play his games and he's tired of tending to her. I watch them get angry and threaten to \"bust her ass\"  when the 2 year old wakes up in the middle of the night and doesn't want to go immediately back to bed. \n\nI've watched my sister exhibit similar behavior but instead of getting mad she gets so defeatedly angry and keeps getting an attitude with the kids if they don't just stay quiet and calm ALL day or she throws a micro hissy fit if the baby cries even once when shes doing something she wants to do. Acts as if the baby is somehow TRYING to annoy her\n\n I feel like these are massive overreactions to very normal child behaviour and that a lot of their anger isn't justified. I've watched him put her in the corner for continuously walking in front of his TV, which to me feels like a very unfair reason to be punished because in my mind, watching TV isn't as important as the well-being of your daughter. Playing games and getting interrupted is not a valid reason to lash out at your kid.\n\nSo anyway I confronted my sister and her husband one day after she tried to talk down to her 2 year old about not respecting her and her time (the kid doesn't understand this conversation and just looked lost and confused and scared) I pointed out all of the angry behavior they've been throwing at their very young and inexperienced children and told them I didn't think it was fair for them to get so angry at very normal child-like behaviour and that they needed to have more patience when it comes to dealing with them, that they're not a task to be completed, but people to nurture and that sometimes that means you need to stop thinking about yourself, stop being selfish, and actually pay attention to your kids instead of punishing them for existing in the same space as them. You don't get \"me\" time anymore, you have an adult responsibility to look after your kids, not play fortnite. \n\nWell, she reminded me it's not my house and that if I didn't like it I could leave. She basically threatened to kick me out, even though both of them are off projects right now and I'm the only one with a steady job who can pay the bills right now.\n\nI know they are not my kids, I know raising kids is hard, but I feel like if the behavior I'm seeing twists my stomach it must be wrong, right? Am I the asshole?",

      "selftext": "I (26 female) have been living in the US. I met my friend, Tonya (fake name), a couple years back. Tonya lived with my then current worker (let's call her Molly) who I was becoming friends with. Us three would hang out fairly regularly, like 2-4 times a month. I would go to their house and we would also go hang out at a park regularly. Tonya was in college and Molly and I were not in college. Eventually Tonya graduated and moved back to her home town area to work for her parents and be closer to her long time boyfriend, who was in school near the area. For the entire time I knew Tonya, she had this boyfriend. Never complained about him, he seemed like a good one based off of what she was telling me. They were long distance so she was excited to be back closer with him. Once she moved back (May 2023) we barely talked. Occasional Instagram reels back and forth. Our friend Molly had a baby, so Tonya came back and visited sometime this year. When she had visited Molly and the baby, I knew she had just gotten engaged a month or two prior but she never singularly told me, I found out through Molly. When I saw her, it was nice to see her and I congratulated her on the long time coming engagement. She was stoked and then asked me to be a bridesmaid. I said yes right off the back cause I was asked in person. Of course I would love to support my friend on her big day. But here's the catch, I've been saving up money and time to go on my solo backpacking travels to New Zealand, Australia, se Asia. I've been wanting to go for years and it finally feels right to go in 2025. I plan on heading out right after my dad's 60th bday in early February. When I finally decided to do this trip, in my head it's about 6 months, or even more. I truly wanna explore and experience these parts of the world. I'm a free soul and I truly wanna just let life flow and travel with my own plans and no specific dates that hold me back. I am single, don't own a house or assets, don't have pets. I don't have anything holding me back to a place or time frame of responsibility..... besides Tonya's wedding. She decided on a date, sometime in June. If I leave mid February , I would only get 4ish months of uninterrupted travel time. That seems like plenty, and maybe it is, but what if it isn't.... what if I'm having the time of my life and finding what I've been longing for? Obviously I won't know until I am traveling and out there. But now I'm thinking I should tell Tonya to take me off the bridal party and I'll try my hardest to make the wedding if I can. If I'm back from travels, I'd love to be apart of her wedding. But I don't want her planning her bridal party with me in it. It's too much guilt and what ifs. I'm not sure what to do. We are friends for sure, but she isn't my closest friend by any means. I feel as if I am not in bridal party, she may only have one other brides maid. I don't know that for sure, but I sympathize with her and her bridal dreams. But I also have to live my life. AITAH?",

      "selftext": "It's weird that I'm asking this question, as I would only say this about 3 people: The first was the guy who tried to kill me, other was my mum's ex who abused both me and her. And the third one is him.\n\nI have to be more specific - I care, but only for the reason that my mom wouldn't take it well. And that is odd because he loves to take her as his personal slave. She worked and took care of him since the age of 10, he never even praised her or supported her in any way. \n\nWe live with him currently - he threw us out last year, but I'm not getting into that - and that's hard because he's aggressive. There were multiple times when he tried to hit me, but only did so when I was a kid. He screams at me for the smallest reasons, every. day. For example, he shouts at me when I try to leave the lights on, and doesn't care about the fact that I only do so because I'm studying. Another example: He called me a whore last week because I wear eyeliner, to which I responded in a way that lead to him shouting at me. \nI never thought of him as my grandpa and he never acted like he was. I don't think he even knows my name or birthday. \n\nSo those are the reasons I don't care about him - most of it is because of my mum. I did leave a lot of things out, because I don't want to make this post too long. \nHe has end-stage heart failure, his condition worsened today.\nI'm writing this as we\u2019re waiting for the ambulance to come, and I'm having a breakdown because I cannot handle the emotions this brought up.\nI thought a lot about why he is the way he is. And he suffered a lot of abuse, so it's clear that's the reason he uses his family and hates everyone who doesn't honour him. I feel sorry for that, but not for the fact that I refuse to be his slave.\n\nBut after all, he's a part of my family, and I should, I really should care about him but I just can't. I've always viewed myself as a caring person, I think it's time to reconsider that. Please be honest with me, I need to know if these feelings are normal or if am I turning into an insensitive person.",

      "selftext": "\nIt's been 4 years since I completely ghosted my bestfriend Mike over a series of bad behaviours. 6 months ago he followed me on Instagram and I've been thinking about clearing the air. I sometimes have dreams where he features and get reminders of how my life was and what went wrong.\n\nMike approached me back in 2015 at Mansion House University (fake names), he was this buff, good-looking man that came from money and me, a working class, shy scrawny kid (both 19). At first I was thinking why is this guy talking to me? I was wary of his intentions because guys like him don't talk me but I was needlessly suspicious. We became close, I saw Mike as a social butterfly and we spent most of our time at university talking to girls (a lot of them being interested in Mike). Weirdly, he brought out a side to me that was confident and charming, enabling me to do things I couldn't do prior to meeting him - not consistently anyways. In the 8 months we studied together, I learned a lot from Mike, and he shifted my mindset for the good but I always felt there was a time limit to our friendship. \n\nWe're both Indian, but culturally we were different. I was born and brought up in the UK where as he was Indian born and brought up all over the world. Our households were different too, the way we both spoke was different and frankly he had a slight toxic side that I guess came from the money he had. Mike very much used his possessions, dad's money and his looks as a means to flex. Things that I and people I generally knew didn't. Regardless of his and my flaws, we had a great time together and I saw him as a close friend. \n\nMy time in the sun comes to an end and I moved away to study at another university and Mike stayed on at Mansion House. Both of us struggled to connect with people in our new classes and facetimed regularly to complain about university life. He even visited a few times and I made my way home to see him too. Mike mentioned an Indian girl moved in next door and was in his class. Phoebe also started featuring in some of our Facetimes and lets just say I knew where this was going. Mike, said he wasn't interested and I believed him to a degree - the kinds of girls we used to talk to, the girls interested in him were far more attractive than Phoebe. I sound shallow, but I spent that time at Mansion house talking to anybody and everybody and Phoebe never made an impression on me. \n\nLong story short, Mike hooks up with Phoebe and they become official within a month. Despite never making it known, we never liked eachother and I think it was because she may have seen me as some sort of womaniser (a lot of people did). Mike always said he was so sociable because I was, and funnily enough I said the same. Us talking to lots of girls was something of prominence, and I guess he may have shifted that light on me when he talked about me to Phoebe? He always said Phoebe was possessive. To me, she seemed like she hovered around Mike and he took advantage of who was easy. They're both Indian, culturally similar and saw each other everyday.\n\nPhoebe had issues though - Mike mentioned how she had money (way more than Mike), came from a broken house hold and she used to cut herself. Soon Mike's whole routine had changed. He'd wake up at 2pm, was always late to facetime and meeting up. It seemed my time didn't mean as much to him. Often asking me to come to his place which was nearly an hour away on the bus and a few times making me wait in the lobby for a while to only hang out there. Mike had done this enough times to piss me off. It's understandable to shift priorities but he was clearly disrespecting my time. I saw this and a series of other actions towards me and reacted appropriately. Our conversations online lagged, dwindling down to sending eachother posts about cars until we didn't. He'd reach out but I didn't respond thinking I don't need such a friend and remembered the times I was disrespected. That was until I hit a rough patch in my life. \n\nThe truth was I struggled to formulate the relationships I had once did with people at my new university. I felt I wasn't good enough to build friendships or relationships with. A date that mattered didn't work out as I wanted and the weight of it all just hit me and I needed to talk it out. Talking to my sister helped but I missed my old life, I missed Mike. I wanted to feel normal again.\n\nMike definelty enabled my true personality to come out, these characteristics were innately part of me but only really came out when I was with my friend and that's what I told him. After a year or so I just gave in and Facetimed him. I told him about everything but the issues I had with him. Communication was never easy for me so I chose to hold back from telling him how his disregard for me drove me to ghost him. It was somewhat selfish and it was partially motivated by a hunch that Phoebe would be in the back listening and analysing.\n\nHe was gracious enough to accept what I was saying but was still suspicious. Regardless, we spoke for hours and it was great. After meeting up I caught him up on my time at university. I changed my appearance drastically thinking it would be one less aspect people could reject me on. Built muscle and dressed well, making my shy and awkward self seem attractive to a lot of women. I spent most of my time sleeping around and I guess it showed mostly on Instagram. I came to terms with my bisexuality and although I was never open about it, I didn't hide it. I think that's how Mike and Phoebe came to know, probably looking into me after our Facetime. There are a lot of Bretman Rock and Nikita dragun types of IG accounts liking my posts - a flaring gun for those looking but I didn't care. My sexuality is my business and I wasn't looking to talk about it so when catching up, I didn't mention everything I got up to. Mike was suspicious though, slyly bringing up some trans women who liked my posts asking if I knew them. \n\nWe got back to some level of normality, talking about our time at Manor House University - Mike loved to reminisce. I think he envied the university experience I had. Mike was the guy girls were attracted to and I think he settled down intensely and quickly. At this point it had been 4 or 5 years since Mike and Phoebe's became official (a month after they hooked up) and he comes out with it. He said he missed our year at Manor House and wondered about the what ifs. I always respected the relationship Mike and Phoebe had and told him no you're settled, what more could he want? In reality, I knew exactly the kinds of girls he used pull, the situations that would literally just land on his lap but I wasn't going to mention them. Not after he was talking about his doubts and what ifs - it wasn't the right thing to do. But he was persistent, bringing up the same topic every time we'd meet up or a hot girl would walk by. Saying, see \"you could go for her\". \n\nHe told me he downloaded tinder when Phoebe was away one time. Given the kind of attention he used to get and the experience he feels like he lacked - I told him to go ahead and try it again. Not the best advice I could've given but every other conversation we'd have, he'd bring this up. I gave him two options where he could quietly explore options which would result in the end of his relationship or he could knuckle down and stay focused on Phoebe. For some reason to validate his decision to not cheat he sent me her nudes. I remember seeing 3 pictures followed by the message \"enjoy\" that grossed me the fuck out. I replied saying I shouldn't have seen those pictures, and told him to delete the prior messages. \n\nMike picked up on how I felt about what he did and I think that sparked some sort of insecurity in him. He started to float the idea of a threesome of all things with Phoebe, him and one of my old fwbs. A girl who I cared for to a certain degree and was half way across the country. I know my morality is something to be questioned since I gave Mike 2 options which included cheating but I would never adopt the \"you can have her now\" or \"enjoy\" mentality some guys have with ex lovers. Phoebe was a 'no go zone' type of girl, even if Mike and her weren't together, it wouldn't even cross my mind because there was a connection between them. Crossing that line would mean on some level, it would bother Mike and I didn't want that. So his proposal of dming my old fwb was the last straw. \n\nThis was a massive overstep and had to ghost. He'd call, text, and even contacted my mum a few times but I never got in touch. \n\nI've cut out a large amount of good and bad moments in our friendship simply because this post would be too long to read. Being Mike's friend and my time at university involved a lot of character building. Therapy helped to clear up my thoughts and feelings and overall I can say, I am a better person coming out of these experiences. For Redditers who want to go all out in the replies, this was 3 years ago and I can communicate like a normal person and don't recommend cheating now. I wouldn't want to be friends with Mike, we're very different people now but I believe in signs and lately Mike has been in my thoughts. Should I clear the air? ",

Personally, I'm pretty benign, and when I do stand up for myself, I'm always questioning my actions--am I right or did I go too far?\n\nThis story happened after my son had divorced his wife (her choice, not his.) After the divorce she found out he'd moved on with his life and was dating someone--this infuriated her and she became violent, coming to his house and his workplace as a crazy person--until he had to get a restraining order against her. Now, they share an 8 yr. old son. Okay, enough back story.\n\nThe new woman he was dating (I'll call her N) seemed okay for months, then she started doing the same things his ex had done--criticizing him, belittling him, etc. This time our son had the good sense to end their relationship. Before that, the girlfriend tried to tell his son that she would be his new stepmom! Uh, no, ain't gonna' happen, but his little boy didn't know that.\n\n  \nSo, one day, we had a knock at the door and my husband answered and went outside to talk. I thought it was a neighbor so I didn't join him. Turns out, it was my son's ex-girlfriend who was trying to get my husband to take her side and get his son to go back with her. Uh\u2026dumb move--as my husband refuses to get involved his son's affairs. (Kinda' sorry I didn't know it was her, or I'd have gotten involved earlier.)\n\nJust then, my son drove up in his son in the car for a visit (I swear she had tracker on his car, how else would she know he was coming?) My son and his father, ignored her and went into the house, but his boy was outside getting ready to play with the neighborhood kids. That's when N tried to emotionally manipulate the boy to get back with his dad. I saw it coming and stepped in.\n\nI (kindly) asked her to leave, but she ignored me. \n\nNow, I have to say, I have a hearing problem and I told N this many times to stop talking to the back of my head, but she still would do it as it was infuriating. This time was no different. \n\nAs I was walking my grandson away from her, she just kept talking to the back of my head. Three times, I asked her to leave, until I finally had to scream at her to leave! UNBELIVABLE--she still kept talking to the back of my head! I finally just had to point at her to leave. Guess what? She wouldn't leave until my grandson started crying! He was upset at the drama! Then she finally left.\n\nWas I the AItah?  \n\n",

We both sorta moved on but now know we both always thought of each other. We found each other about 8 years later on social media and immediately got back together, for the most part things are super great, I really love her and can 100% see a future with her. \n\nShe unfortunately had a very rough 8 years of substance abuse, SA, overall just sorta bad stuff happen to her that caused a ton of trauma which has put a lot of halts or issues in the relationship and recently she was diagnosed with BPD and is on some medication and seeing both a psychiatrist and therapist regularly however the progress is definitely slow which I get; everyone has their own pace. \n\nFreshman year of high school my parents decided to pull me out of public and throw me into home school, which I have my own opinions of but recently I found out they did not submit my transcripts to my state and as such I lack a highschool diploma. I\u2019m 31. While my career choices are also poorly made I am a 3rd party k9 handler but I\u2019ve always wanted to be in law enforcement and be the change law enforcement needs because I believe if you want change in something you have to be that change and feel I could do exactly that. Unfortunately law enforcement has a age limit of when you can get hired on as a new officer which I\u2019m kissing the limit of that age so I decided instead of trying to do school between a irregular high demanding job handling k9 I would go navy reserve which would not only help me get my GED in the process but also give me the qualifications needed to be a cop and help me propel myself into a long term reliable career with benefits for her and I both, better home buying power and eventually live the life I\u2019ve always dream of which is just simply comfortable because I\u2019ve always stayed just above drowning with expenses. She\u2019s very comfortable herself and has a high paying comfortable hybrid work from home job that meets all her needs which is all I want for myself. \n\nWhile the other issues in the relationship are overall tolerable and will get better with time and mental health help on her end she is extremely against the military regardless of the reasons and has told me \u201csome people just don\u2019t get everything they want\u201d. I need yall to understand I\u2019ve never been on vacation, often have to ask my dad for help to stay above water, have no clue how I\u2019m going to get a new car when my current finally meets its end and ultimately just want to experience a little bit in life outside of never leaving my hometown outside of job training when you get a new dog or need to certify. She tells me I\u2019m her only purpose in life and the 10 weeks of navy boot camp is too much for her to handle. She\u2019ll kill herself if I go, I don\u2019t care about her, none of this affects me and so on. Tbh this is all stressful including boot. I\u2019m worried about getting hurt, failing, not being good at it, I am older which is scary and now I have this on my shoulders. Am I being selfish? Should I just continue running the gamut on a generally unreliable employment just due to high turnover rate and it all being contract based which can be lost at any time? Am I really just this shitty person wanting to help myself have a more reliable career and be able to comfortably provide for myself? I really feel bad putting so much on my dad financially as an adult and while he does so happily my dad deserves to use his own damn money as he pleases not planning to help his 31yo son out on the gas bill or from being short on rent. \n\nI\u2019m really at a loss here, she won\u2019t live with me because my place is too small and I can\u2019t live with her because she roommates with her sister to help make things easier. Homes are way too expensive and well out of our reach for purchase. If we tried to rent together we have too many dogs as she has 2 and I have 3. I really don\u2019t want the carry the weight and have someone\u2019s whole mental health and purpose be hinged 100% on my shoulders. I\u2019m at a loss. I love her but I also need to make sure my life can be sustained. What do I do? I swear in soon and don\u2019t want anything to happen to her and I\u2019m really scared. People with BPD are often successful in their attempts and that would really put trauma on me. \n\nWhat do I do? ",

We were supposed to have plans on the following Monday but he cancelled two hours before and said I understand how this is going to look And that you will be mad and I replied if I could get a reason as to why he was cancelling and he just has not replied. now two days later and he is still looking at my Instagram stories, etc but still no reply, I have not tried to contact him since either\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is a sign that I should just end this as there\u2019s clearly something going on (I\u2019ve only been to his house once, and we had a little misunderstanding a month ago and he said he was giving me an \u2018out\u2019 if I wanted it which obviously I did not) \n\nWould you leave him if you were in my situation?\n\nUpdate\n\nHe replied after day 3 and said that I probably wanna break up etc I\u2019ll bring your stuff round, this felt like a break up text so I was like sure whatever and that was that.\n\nHowever in my anger and upset I messaged him a week later saying idk how he could just ghost me and break up over a text after 1 year of being together. Turns out he was just assuming I\u2019d wanna break up with him because of how he handled the situation. he lost his job the day he cancelled and ghosted me and couldn\u2019t face me hence the 3 day silence. I told him I\u2019m sorry about that but I don\u2019t think that kind of communication is healthy you should be able to tell your partners these things so I said we should still be apart. \n\nIt\u2019s only been 3 days since that conversation but I\u2019m starting to wonder if I was being too harsh and reacting to past trauma from my ex who would go silence for weeks at a time.

      "selftext": "Little background -- I work in healthcare. A very, *very* busy, high-patient turnover, procedural area. \n\nThe hard part: My older coworker (50's) is very much overweight, and has bad knees (osteoarthritis - it is truly painful). This person has worked in this same hospital for >30 years. Excellent provider. Great knowledge base. Lovely, lovely person. Very smart, well-loved, and well-known. Also loved by myself. We are good friends - met at work several years ago when I started.\n\nThe problem is that she absolutely does not contribute to patient care because she physically cannot even stand (she uses a cane). Her knees prevent her from walking, and she gets very short of breath, even upon taking just a few short steps. In the area that we work, we are like bouncy-springs : we have to get up very, very, **very** frequently to move patients through the environment to achieve their exams. Constantly getting up when a new patient arrives, and sitting back down to document for a few seconds, and then getting right back up again because another patient needs you. It's like this all shift long, by the nature of the environment we work in. \n\nWe work the same shift, and I inevitably end up doing the vast majority of the work - and it's really taking a toll on me, and I can feel myself becoming more and more annoyed by the situation. All of her other coworkers definitely make up for her deficits and areas of lack, but this feels so unfair to everyone else who has to \"make up for\" her physical limitations. As much as I love her, and everyone else does, too.....I'm not sure I can keep on like this. I'm not mad at her or anything. I just think she needs to be able to be held to the same expectations that everyone else is held to at work - standing long hours, lifting, moving patients, etc etc. But she truly cannot do any of these things. She went to try to have her knee replaced, but her orthopedic team told her she is too overweight for surgery right now.\n\nSo.... I don't want to rock the boat. I don't want to create drama. Should I just leave this be, and just deal with it so that I don't create a rift between her and everyone else (including myself), and embarrass her for her limitations? Or is this reasonable to bring this to my manager, and discuss this? I feel like such an asshole because she really is fantastic, but she physically cannot do the job, and everyone else has been making up for it. AITAH if I talk to my manager about this? I feel so torn and guilty because I really do care about her.\n\n",

      "selftext": "So, I have bene dating my boyfriend for almost 5 years, we have been dating since high school, and we are in our early 20s. My relationship with his family has never been  close one since we\u2019ve spent most of our relationship hanging outside his family home and they have never invited me to things unless it was a big extended family event. However, I have always been very kind and respectful to them. They have never really been too interested in my life either and never ask me questions about myself but I just assumed that they were too busy or distracted when we would talk.\n\n(His family and I have vastly different political and religious views but I never thought that would be an issue.) \n\nHowever, in the last two years or so, their feelings about me seemed to have shifted to disliking me and/or judgmental of me, which I believe stems from our differing views. Most of what they say is behind my back and I\u2019ve heard about it from my boyfriend. They have talked about how \u201chigh maintenance\u201d I am. When my cat was diagnosed with cancer and I had to nurse her, his family told my boyfriend that I should \u201cjust take her out back and shoot her.\u201d Recently they have even looked up my family\u2019s personal info such as our homes, jobs, salaries, etc. instead of just asking me, they then proceeded to show their extended family this personal info. \n\nMost recently, at Thanksgiving time, his family went to their home near a lake to celebrate the holiday and they didn\u2019t invite me. Since they didn\u2019t invite me and it would\u2019ve been a three hour drive from where my boyfriend is at school he decided to spend Thanksgiving at my families home. We had a really great time even though he got a lot of backlash from his family.\n\nAfterwards, his cousin ended up telling us that his father had gone on a rant in front of the family + extended family about how my boyfriend was spending Thanksgiving with his \u201cnew family\u201d and that I am \u201cchanging him for worse.\u201d I was very hurt by everything that was said and coupled with everything they have said and done the past few years, I am at the end of my rope with them. \n\nI told my boyfriend that I wanted to go no contact to low contact with his family. Luckily my boyfriend is entirely supportive (and always has been) and even offered to go low contact with them but since they\u2019re paying for his college I told him he shouldn\u2019t. \n\nWhen talking this through with my mom and grandma, my grandma was entirely supportive of me. However, my mother implied that I was being over dramatic and that I should just \u201csuck it up\u201d and not make things harder for my boyfriend. It really made me feel like maybe I was being the asshole.\n\nSo AITAH?",

So just for info, I'm very close to my neighbor as she was my babysitter and i spend most of my time at her place. Ever since i was little, she always liked this guy, i don't know the details but i remember them always being on and off. She would often cry and be unhappy because of him. About 3 or 4 years ago, she built a house for them to start living together (he barely contributed to it). I don't know what happens behind closed doors but they would fight pretty often. It would result in her kicking him out and then they make up few days later. For info, this guy, he's so irresponsible like i don't get why she chose him, he acts like a child and he has bad drinking habits. I think it has been 20 years? since they knew each other, and she always wanted to get married but it  still never happened for some reasons, but who am i to judge. People that are very close to her have expressed their concerns of her being with him, and told her to break up with him so many times but she just won't do it.\n\nAnyways, today was her bday, and this mf didn't even get her a present instead he went to drink with his alcoholic friends first thing in the morning. She ended up really stressed, she had plans to go out during the day and everything was ruined. Later he came back and went to sleep, and he started to cry? because he wasn't feeling well he started punching the walls and tried to hit her. Even after all of that, (which btw it's not the first time he does something like that), she brings him to the hospital where he ends up starting a fight with a doctor. Her whole day was ruined. I feel so bad for her, she is working so hard and has lost so much weight trying to provide for a guy which in my opinion doesn't love her at all. She is the sweetest person ever and still she doesn't know what she's worth. She genuinely looks so happy when the guy shows her even an ounce of attention. I know that I shouldn't judge other people's relationships but this is so concerning, to see her cry so often just truly breaks my heart. I have tried talking to her but she just won't listen. I can't do anything but hope that she just realize her worth. I know that everyone is responsible for their own feelings and that she's an adult but i just feel so bad. How is it that the adults, her own family isn't seeing that this is so wrong why aren't they trying to help her out?? But i feel like I'm even worst that them, because I'm not doing anything I'm just hoping that the adults would magically do something. I know that I won't be able to talk sense into her but I just hope to make her happy by being next to her. I feel like she still sees me as this kid that she babysitted, but i wish she could just tell me when things get hard even if I can't do much. I feel like I'm not helping at all, i just don't know what to do but it feels so much like an excuse.",

Understood. So the game is going on, people are petting the dog and getting in his face. The dog isn't freaking out despite this, so I decide to give him a gentle rub on the back and let him lick my face. \n\nBad idea, and the dog tore off a decent chunk of my lip. Ok, **my bad.** I went to the emergency room, got stitches, whatever. \n\nIt isn't until this morning when shit goes wrong. I'm still on my dad's insurance so he found out today about the incident. **My dad threatens to call animal control and file a police report if Jack does not agree to pay the hospital bill.** I call Jack in a panic and tell him what my dad plans to do, and Jack responds by telling me that **if animal control gets called, Jack will tell all of our friends that I *wanted* the dog to die, and he (and his sister) will make sure I never speak to my friends again.** \n\nSo I'm panicking calling both Jack and my dad trying to get them both to calm down. I try to get Jack to give me his dad's number so our parents can go over the insurance information. Jack tells me that apparently his dad is overseas/on a cruise (?) and doesn't have a phone. So I give Jack my dad's number, and Jack lies and tells my dad that the dog has never bitten anyone in the past. (Four other people). My dad and Jack cuss each other out until I manage to get my dad to drop the police report/animal control. \n\n\nTo be clear, I'm at fault regarding the dog, I'm pissed at my friend however, for: \n\n1. Lying and saying the dog has never bit anyone else. \n\n2. Lying and saying his dad is on vacation, and somehow decided not to bring his phone. \n\n3.

I know it isn't any of my business to begin with, but she had been on and off with this guy for almost a year before finally breaking up with him months ago after he made a pass at one of her other friends. He was a douchebag from the very beginning, but she was stuck in the honeymoon phase and mostly blind to his antics. What she did see, she easily explained away or justified. Every time they had a disagreement or he cheated (again), I was the one she came too; I listened to her cry and complain and I consoled her until he texted her a half-baked apology and she ran right back to him. Rinse and repeat. It was so frustrating and draining seeing someone I care so much about consistently put themselves in a situation where they would inevitably be hurt, and I was so glad to finally be done with that cycle when she broke things off for good. Anyways, I didn't fight her much on the decision. I basically just sighed and shook my head. She's a grown woman, so there was nothing I could do to stop her. \n\nA couple days back, she texted me at around 10PM to tell me that he wanted to see her, and that she was thinking about going to his place (they had been talking, but had not yet met up since reconnecting). Apparently, he offered to pay for an uber to come and get her. He lives about half an hour away. She doesn't have a car and he didn't feel like driving down to come get her. She said she was calling because she wanted my advice. I obviously told her it was a bad idea. She said they were just going to have a conversation, maybe chill and watch a movie \"like old times.\" I told her there was no way he was paying for an uber to get her thirty minutes away and not expecting sex, so she better prepare herself for that reality. She said he didn't \"give her that vibe.\" I could tell from how hard she was defending her decision to go that she had already made up her mind. She has a habit of calling me and others for advice and then not taking it. I told her she should do whatever she wanted and that was that. Later on that night I received another call from her. I was already sleeping, and calling this late at night is extremely out of character for her, so I figured it was important and answered. Well when I answered she was bawling her eyes out. Full on sobbing. It was so bad that I thought something unrelated had happened, like maybe she got bad news or hurt herself somehow. But she ended up telling me what happened through sobs and the story goes as follows:\n\nShe got an uber to his house (he did pay for it) and because he lives in an apartment where you need to be buzzed in past a certain time, she had to text him when she arrived so that he could let her in. You probably already figured as much, but they did end up having sex. Afterwards, he got up to use the bathroom or whatever and she, for reasons I still do not understand, decided to pick up his phone that he had left behind. What she saw wasn't messages from some other chick or anything like that, no, actually it was her own text message to him that made her cry. Let me explain. I guess when she texted him to let him know that she was pulling up, he went to let her in without actually opening her message or responding to it, so it was still there on the lock screen when she picked up his phone. She saw her own \"I'm here\" message but realized she was saved in his phone as \"Ole reliable.\" When she told me that I caught the SpongeBob reference and even though I didn't burst out laughing or anything, I chuckled a little. Well, she started screaming at me and saying that all men are alike and that she knew I was enjoying her misery because I was sadistic just like her ex. Then she hung up. I was honestly already tired of the drama and wasn't interested in being roped back into their toxic dynamic. I figured she was upset now but would forgive him soon enough. I just went back to sleep and didn't bother calling or texting her again that night. But when I woke up, I had some mutual friends tell me that it was fucked up for me to laugh at her because it was kind of like I was kicking her when she was down. I wasn't laughing at her situation, I just found the reference mildly funny. Admittedly, I wasn't taking the situation as seriously as I probably should have, but I think that's because I'm desensitized to it all now. I did apologize and explained that I wasn't laughing at her pain, but she hasn't responded. AITAH?",

      "selftext": "First of all, I want to say I\u2019m new in this subreddit and apologize if I make a mistake in formatting this post or if my English is off (I am not a native speaker), but I need feedback on how to deal with this.\n\nI\u2019m in a friend group of 6 people (\u201cA \u2013 me\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, \u201cD\u201d, \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF\u201d). We all met in college, and we try to see each other once a month. Since finishing college and getting jobs, for the past 4 years, \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d have always relied on car rides from me and \u201cB\u201d. Info: C has her own car and D lives in a place that has an excellent public transportation system.\n\nIt started out with me and \u201cB\u201d being fine with it, especially because both of us love driving, but after a while we just got tired and frustrated from always driving them. It\u2019s always the same: Picking them up from their houses (usually making a BIG detour), being stuck in traffic, arriving at the restaurant (in the center of the city, where parking is expensive and there are very few parking spaces) and then having to take them home at the end of the night (so we are always the designated drivers). Both me and \u201cB\u201d have tried talking to them, giving hints, it got to the point of not responding to them, but the outcome is always the same: they say we need plan theses rides so we don\u2019t all take the our cars, ending with me and \u201cB\u201d always giving free rides (they never paid parking or gas).\n\nNow to issue at hands: I got so tired and frustrated that I started embellishing the truth, so I do not have to give rides. An example: when asked for a free ride (they always ask at the last minute), I would say I have another engagement prior so I can\u2019t give any rides. If they asked where I was going, I would just say it\u2019s a family thing. Recently I was with \u201cE\u201d and was venting on my phone with my mom about this whole situation, how I just lied to not give free rides. Suddenly \u201cE\u201d started looking at my phone and I think she SAW THE WHOLE CONVERSTION. \u201cE\u201d said she was just looking for the time on my phone, but she actively stared for various seconds, so I know she saw something but do not know how much. \u00a0Since then, \u201cE\u201d has been acting weird around me and I feel like an awful person, so I have to ask: AITA for this whole situation?",

A GACHA game where there are 4 male love interests, you can battle and play stories with them to learn their lore. this wasnt something that i hid from her, i actually told her about it many times as i have spent a lot of money on merch and go to lots of social events regarding the game. i understand that its probably a little weird to be playing romance games whilst in a relationship, but i didnt think too much of it as ive always played this type of game especially as a young teenager. now as i said, i attend a lot of events regarding the game. and recently i made a friend group at a cosplay convention, which is also a hobby that i have always enjoyed. this was my first time making friends at a convention, so i was really happy about finally having a sense of community and when telling my girlfriend everything she all the sudden got really closed off and i could tell something was bothering her. after a little while of refusing to speak, she eventually told me that she doesnt like me making friends. and that she cant help but hate anyone who enters my life in fear that that they will get in the way of our future together. she said she doesnt mind me having friends as long as i dont talk about it and promise they are only temporary until we move in together, because she doesnt want them in our household. she was very apologetic whilst saying all these things, so naturally i was comforting her whilst still trying to understand her point of view. i did end up promising her that they will only be temporary, and that to me she is the only permanent person in my life. \n\nnow fast foward a few days, i post my photoshoto photos from the convention. i was cosplaying one or the male love interests, so she got curious and decided to finally search the game. this is when she found out that it was a dating simulator, she took it to heart and honestly i cant really blame her for it. the term dating simulator does seem way more extreme as to what the game actually consists of, thres a lot of lore, battling, card collecting, and minigames, whilst also being able to boost your relationship stats with the characters. i did explain everything to her, but she is still uncomfortable with me playing it. i never actively hid this from her so i had hoped she wouldnt be too upset about it,  but she is a very jealous and possessive person in general, and typically doesnt like me having feiends or interactions with others. \n\ni have since apologised several times, given explanations, even let her play the game and show her everything, but she still wants it gone. now i have been playing this game since the release, and have spent hundreds on it. because hey i have adult money now, why not indulge in something i enjoy? so its pretty sad to have to let go of a hobby that has given me a community \n\n\nAITA?",

      "selftext": "Not me, but my spouse. This happened a few years ago and it's bothered me ever since. \n\nEarly in our relationship, my spouse (at the time, 25 MtF pre-transition) brought me (at the time, 25NB) to a family gathering for their birthday. Spouse and I are both on the spectrum ourselves (we were each diagnosed with Aspergers as kids, back when that was still a diagnostic category). While there, spouse mentioned that they'd always wondered whether their neice (5 at the time) was also on the spectrum. They asked for my opinion, because I had an undergraduate background in child psychology. I answered that I'm not qualified to diagnose anyone, and that even if I was, I've met the kid twice, so I hadn't even seen much of her behavior. This conversation continued, and eventually they asked if they should ask their sister (33 at the time) whether she'd considered having neice \"tested\" for it. \n\nI said I didn't know the sister, and I also don't know much about their relationship, so I'm not sure. I said that if they did have the kind of relationship where they discussed that kind of thing, and where she'd view the question as coming from a good place, then it couldn't hurt to mention sometime. \n\nSpouse immediately went into the room where the sister was. They were the only two in the room, so it was a private conversation. I don't know the exact phrasing that was used, but spouse said something along the lines of the title. \n\nThe next thing I saw was sister chasing spouse into the room where the rest of the family was, while attempting to hit spouse and getting a few slaps in. She yelled to the room that spouse had said neice was autistic, and my FIL took neice to the back porch while BIL started yelling at spouse. \n\nGrandma-in-law (?) Came to talk to me, saying negative things about my spouse and that she hated that \"vile\" thing spouse suggested about neice. Since she knew we were both also on the spectrum, describing being autistic as \"vile\" bothered me, but I didn't say anything about this in the moment. \n\nWe left the gathering, and spouse has refused to talk to sister or grandma since, and that decision has been broadly respected. \n\nI definitely recognize that her responding with violence was disproportionate, but I can't help but feel like there's some kind of social rule we fucked up on in the situation because my spouse asked the question and I didn't discourage it. \n\nSoooo...

      "selftext": "This might sound kinda dumb but I'm genuinely confused and would like to know if something I said makes me shallow. \n\nBasically me (f18) and my two best friends (f18 and m18) who we will call A and B have a group chat. A said that someone who has recently been on a reality TV show walked into her work today and she said she thought he was really attractive. She sent a picture of him and B agreed that he was attractive. \n\nI personally had never seen the show and had no idea who he was so I just asked who he was and what his name was. I didn't say anything about his attractiveness or anything like that. When I found out his name I googled him and found an article that said he got 4 A\\* at A-Level and was studying for a degree in biomedical engineering. Now, for me personally, intelligence is extremely attractive. I love someone who is academically smart (I am no genius but was probably a bit above average at school and loved it when a guy could keep up with me or do better than me in maths lol) and my friends know this. I have always just considered this as my 'type' the way people do with blonde hair or green eyes etc. Obviously it's not a dealbreaker but it is something that would draw me to someone in the first place. \n\nBy no means am I against dating someone who isn't 'smart'. Intelligence is not measured by how good someone's grades are and I know this. My last boyfriend was not someone who was stereotypically 'smart' (he was in the lower sets in school etc and got average to below average grades) but he was by no means stupid. I actually a friend who knew my type was often intelligent people who implied by ex was stupid because of his grades and I cut them off for it. However, I cared for my ex because of the person he was and didn't care less about the grades he got and this goes for any future boyfriend. While it may be a turnoff at the start because i do find intelligence attractive, if he can make me laugh and smile then that means 100x more to me than how good he is at school. \n\nSorry for going off track, just trying to give some context. Anyway, so when I saw how intelligent the person A and B were talking about appeared to be, I went back to the group chat and told them about his grades and degree and agreed that he was definitely attractive. \n\nHowever, B then called me shallow for saying this. I was confused and asked how thinking him being intelligent was attractive and he told me that I could find the most physically attractive guy on the planet but if he didn't have 5 A\\* and was a genius then I would call him ugly. This is obviously not true, my ex being an obvious example of why this is not true. I then asked B where I ever implied I didn't think the guy from the TV show was unattractive in the first place (because I had said absolutely nothing about his attractiveness before I googled him) and B just said that it was just a vibe he got from me. \n\nBefore I saw how intelligent he appeared to be, I'll admit, I didn't necessarily find him attractive, but I definitely didn't think he was ugly by any means either. He was just a person on a screen. His attractiveness/ looks in general didn't even cross my mind to be honest. I think generally for me someone's attractiveness doesn't cross my mind until I find out more information on them because until I know some stuff about them, they are just some random person. B was even the first person to tell me that in his opinion, I would not be able to date someone unless I had been friends for a long time first and knew them very well, which, after thinking about it, is probably true. Sorry if that sounds a bit weird but I hope you understand the point I'm trying to make. \n\nAnyway, after this I didn't respond because I was quite upset and didn't understand how it made me shallow. I thought being shallow was when you judge purely based off looks and nothing else? But I did the opposite of this? Plus, my attraction to intelligence is not a requirement, just kind of my type and I definitely don't think any less of someone just because they don't have perfect grades, it just means their intelligence is based in the real world rather than on a piece of paper. After this, A and B continued chatting on the group chat like nothing happened and A seemed to take B's stance. I haven't said anything else because I'm  still a little upset. I explained all this to another friend and she gave this long speech about attractiveness being subjective and personal but I feel like that was her way of agreeing with them without wanting to upset me so now I'm just confused. I guess I can see a little how it was shallow but I genuinely didn't mean it in a mean way. \n\nSo, AITA? Should I apologize to my friends? If I was genuinely being shallow please tell me how and why so I can stop being this was, I do not want to upset my friends as I love them very much.   \n",

      "selftext": "I am a school counselor at an elementary school this is year 6 there. I have developed some really good relationships and tend to go above and beyond my counseling duties when I am able. I run things like the school PBIS store once a month and I have helped with some assemblies. I made a video for one assembly, that was 3 minutes long, to help talk about our focus for the month, responsibility. Admin often comes to me with questions as they are both new. They lean on me for help and support, which I dont mind and value our relationship. It's been a long time since I have had an admin team that is supportive and collaborative. \n\nI have a new cocounselor this year. She is often repeats herself and has been known to corner people and talk to them even after the conversation should be over. We are in education, we don't have a lot of time and need to be quick and intentional often. These are just side notes, she is kind, and a good school counselor. \n\nOur styles of counseling are very different. The kids at school do not see me as admin, I am someone they can joke around with and also come to if they need to talk. I have a great relationship that I have worked so hard to build by being my authentic self. I do not feel that she has clicked with the students in the same way yet but she is still new!\n\nI have recently noticed that she comes from a lot of privilege and we don't see eye to eye on a lot of things. An example of this is wanting to hotline for a student reporting they have bugs in their house, they live in a duplex that edges the woods, they are well taken care of and rodents are frequent around here, we have them in our school. We had a long discussion about it. I dont think she felt supported but I didn't know how else to handle it. I have the sibling in my grade and have worked with this family a lot. A hotline call for something like this would be detrimental to our relationship and I don't feel that bugs are abuse or neglect if the student doesn't have bites or evidence of them (crawling out of their stuff, etc). I ended up telling her to go with her gut, hotline if she felt she should. \n\nAnother incident that rubbed me the wrong way was when she met with a students family she looked up their address in the system. She was telling me about the family, mom is white and dad is black, she made a comment about the affluent neighborhood that they live in and \"they must rent\". \n\nAgain, not super important but gives some background in why I'm feeling the way I am. I realize I commented about her being long winded and I'm writing a book! \n\nAt the beginning of the year our director visited us to talk out a plan for the year and go over our expectations and what not. At that time, I changed my lesson plans begrudgingly because I knew being in a new school it's nice to feel like you have control over something. I had previously worked hard to get it where it needed to be with the previous cocounselor, based on our students needs. I also made some other changes like how we do lunch duty, which really messed up my schedule, to try and accommodate her. \n\nI held her hand for the first 2 months. I invited her to all my teacher meetings and anything she wanted to go to so she felt included and welcome in the building. Social gatherings i always made sure she knew about so she didn't feel left out. I really tried to build a positive vibe in the school, she was in district previously so I knew her but I wanted her to feel welcome in her new school. \n\nRecently she has offered to help with things. For the school store she sat in my office one day for half the day working on buckets to sell things from. I had ziploc bags and was upgrading to plain buckets. She opted to decorate them. While doing this, she complained that she was expected to do it and how it shouldn't fall on us. This was her choice to help and even do this. I was fine with plain buckets. I told her we didn't have to and it wasn't expected but it was nice of her to help out and make it look nice. \n\nRecently she has been complaining a lot about our administration and how she doesn't feel like they like her. She has also made comments to me, as well as other teachers who are telling me, that \"no one appreciates me, I'm sorry i don't have time to make videos and do all that stuff\". Shots fired? I get it. I am a chairperson for a commitee that supports positive behavior (pbis). I enjoy doing things that help cover tier 1 intervention in a fun way. If I can get our kids on board and excited I am down. In the end, it helps limit the number of kids that are coming to me for things they should be able to handle on their own. They are learning their tier 1 skills through pbis lessons and our weekly counseling lessons. I don't feel like this is way outside my scope of work or job description. Maybe it is. \n\nDuring meetings she often asks for me to support her in her thoughts. This part i was an AH and wasn't supportive. She asked \"i have never been used as an incentive in a students plan before, have you?\" And because I have, I said yeah. I have. I see how that could have been worded differently and how I wasn't supportive. I apologized for that, in the meeting in front of the same people I said the comment in front of. She fired back \"well [students name] is always in your office so that doesn't count\". The student She listed was going through some issues at the beginning of the year and taking breaks frequently. They had a change in their IEP and have not seen me other than to walk by and say hi, since September. The student was also never on a behavior plan so that wasn't even a relevant comment. \n\nShe has started taking more jabs at me, saying little comments, coming to complain about admin to while also complaining that they treat her differently than me. She has been bringing up mistakes they made in the first weeks of school, such as calling me for a trauma response when it was her student, calling me first in situations where they need a counselor, a teacher reached out to me about help with an issue, etc. \n\nI got an email from my director saying she wanted to meet with me about my data and the non-school counseling duties I have. I thought this was funny since I hadn't entered much data for the year. Oops I was behind. My director met with me Friday and we talked for quite some time about how things are going. \n\nWhat it boils down to is I dont have my co counselors back and because I do other duties like the committee chair, i am making her look bad. The co counselor also expressed that she doesn't want these responsibilities to fall on her shoulders if I ever leave. And brings up how she is going to get married and have kids and a family one day... I get that, but if you don't want the responsibilities don't be the committe chair person? Also, I leave at contract time daily. So why is that relevant? \n\nI also am stuck with having the obligation of trying to figure out how to make myself less likeable? I don't know. I know I'm being hard headed right now. But the co counselor said she has teachers ask if she is OK because they said my name at an assembly and she never gets recognized. I feel that part isn't the truth but whatever. I made a video they announced I'd be showing it. \n\nI'm stuck on how to navigate this. I'm burdened with the task of stopping all the things I do outside of counseling. I'm also burdened with the task of being more supportive and getting admin to like my co counselor. I'm frustrated. My co counselor is sensitive and often feels attacked by things I wouldn't think twice about. She often comes to me about it and we talk through it but since I don't just immediately agree she feels I'm not being supportive. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I navigate this? Am I an AH for all of this? I am angry I don't want to go back to work and have to deal with this drama on top of my job. ",

      "selftext": "My (28f) paternal grandma (70 something f) has always been a piece of work. She is one of those eternally negative people, who never has anything nice to say about anyone. Her own kids, my father included, can only take her in doses because of her antics. These antics include, but are in no way limited to:\n\nLiterally walking behind the Starbucks counter to make her own drink because the 16-year old barista accidentally brushed the inside of the empty cup with one singular finger\n\nBlaming her poor parenting on menopause and my dad \u201cnot being the brightest\u201d\n\nNasty comments on the side of the family that she has only ever seen a handful of times on her entire life\n\nAnd the most relevant, racist comments about Hispanic people\n\nSo that brings us two a couple years ago. For the record, the entirety of my dad\u2019s family is white, with me and my daughter being the exception. I am mixed (half black), and my daughter is half Mexican. I promise this will matter later.\n\nAbout three years ago, I was a newly single mother after a particularly brutal break up with my daughters father  when my grandma had sent me a text to tell me that B had passed away. B, my grandma\u2019s husband was a wonderful man. Since he came into her life when me and my brothers were children, he was always kind, funny, generous, and positive. I think we all kind of wondered how such opposites could attract the way they did. But I truly enjoyed him, though I didn\u2019t know him very well being that they lived so far away and the relationship between grandma and dad was strained, leading to infrequent visits. When he\u2019d passed, he\u2019d been sick for well over a decade, losing his memory and being homebound for the majority of that time. While it wasn\u2019t necessarily a shock that he had passed away, it was sad news.\n\nQueue my stepmom, brother, me, and my daughter heading to the west coast for the memorial. It was a wonderful service and it was beautiful to see all the loves this genuine man had touched.\n\nHowever, what wasn\u2019t beautiful was the fact that I showed up with a 7-month old that no one had known existed. Awkward was an understatement. But truly, I didn\u2019t care all that much and just assumed that grandma hadn\u2019t told anyone because she was embarrassed that I was a single mom. Wouldn\u2019t have been a stretch to assume, really.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t prepare for was a later conversation I\u2019d have with my brother, where he\u2019d told me what she\u2019d said. Basically, when the service was over, my stepmom, daughter, and I road separately in one car, and my brother and grandma in another. While I don\u2019t know how the topic of grandma not telling anyone about my daughter had come up, my brother said that grandma stated she didn\u2019t tell anyone because \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to have to explain the race of the baby\u201d. It\u2019s important to note that my grandma has previously said negative things about Hispanic people, though never so \u201cdirectly\u201d, more of that subtle type racism.\n\nI was livid. We left the very next day, and I\u2019ve barely spoken to her since. My stepmom, always the peacekeeper (with the best of intentions, we love her I promise) has tried to bridge the gap multiple times, but I have never been able to forgive this. The way I see it, she is either racist against my daughter, or willingly put my daughter in a situation where other around her felt some kind of way about her without letting me know prior. And I don\u2019t take that lightly.\n\nNow, here\u2019s where I may be the A-hole. My stepmom has reminded me multiple times that grandma\u2019s health seems to be rapidly deteriorating, and with so many people in the family having limited to not contact with her, she\u2019s becoming lonely and isolated. I know what it would mean to her if I tried to bridge the gap. And I\u2019ve been told I hold grudges. Should I be over this all these years later? Should I try to give her a chance? I need to know if I\u2019m being vindictive here, cutting her out of my life and putting surrounding family in situations where it\u2019s either her presence or mine and my daughters. Am I mama bearing too hard? Or am I doing the right thing by my daughter?",

      "selftext": "I hope everyone is doing well. English is not my first language so please bear it with me. This might sound like a rant but i am just trying to give every details to be fair. \n\ni just moved in with my boyfriend few months ago. He owns the house but his friend lives with him. His friend pays rent (helps with mortgage) and bills. I am currently a university student (no current part time job as i just moved in to this country as well but i am looking). \n\nWhen i first moved in, i noticed couple of messes here and there. The friend does online business so whenever he gets orders he would put the \u2018about to dispatch parcels\u2019 in a pile on the stairs. He would invite his friend over for drinks and usually after a piss up they would just leave the glasses and cups in the sink, cans and bottles on the kitchen table. He also has a dog. i\u2019d say barely kept since as far as i can recall he has never taken her to a vet/groomer. I remember him getting mad at the dog for biting her nail but honestly ive never seen them getting trimmed. Either way, his dog would create a mess as well. He had also put a glass of moulded beer/wine on two different occasions in the sink. Luckily it was my boyfriend who was doing the dishes (on both occasions) so he had to deal with it not me hihi. All and all, even after those, i would just clean it up whenever ive got the time. I would also cook because that is my coping mechanism and would prefer to say i am better at it as compared to the other two. \n\nHowever, last week, i was bombarded with assignments. That and occasionally missing friends and family back home. It\u2019s also good to note i commute to uni everyday (half an hour walk from/to train station, another half on the train and then 15 mins to campus). I cleaned the house every friday cause that is my day off uni. I was so tired from going out and about on saturday and on Sunday i finally got my chill time. I admit that i had left a glass of water and a bottle of drink in the living room and did not clean it up afterwards. Monday, after i left at 9 am came back at about 6pm, we all decided to watch some film and after it ended i got tired again and admittedly i left a bag of crisp in the living room as well. Tuesday was roughly the same time of coming and leaving except i came a little later (about 7pm i think). Wednesday when i got home at about 1, i cooked some lunch before getting an idea of doing the dishes while i waiting for my hair to process (i thought about dying it at home). I immediately went upstairs to get started, but realised that the stuffs i got might not be enough. Then amazon declined my bank, and i had to sign up for another local bank instead. I was caught up with it until the friend came home (earlier than i expected). \n\nBefore i got the chance to come downstairs and let him know i\u2019ll be taking care of the dishes, i overheard him berating me to his mate who happened to be there. The thing is, the blame was put all on me even though there was some other dirty dishes from the night before (friend and his mate had a piss up) and breakfast (boyfriend had his cereal and a cup of coffee). There was also a pile of clothes (jackets and hoodies) of bf\u2019s and mine but again that was blamed on me. Not only that, bf had also been home before him (he knew bcs he saw it from the front door camera). But i was the one who was blamed. \n\nWe had a little argument and he said that after his long shift he just wanted to come home to a clean tidy house to which i was like \u2018everyone wants that, everyone has had a long shift\u2019. Point is i dont understand why he\u2019s complaining about picking up after my mess when i have been doing so the moment i moved in. After he left i cried to my boyfriend because i was upset for carrying the blame when i feel like i shouldn\u2019t have. Bf had a word with him to which he then kept yelling and shouting (his mate was in the next room, i was upstairs). He claimed the kitchen to be his, and that i was a pain in the arse. In al honesty it hurt me a little. \n\nWe did have a meeting the next day about what happened. It was my boyfriend who called the meeting; initial point of meeting is to lay out the pet peeves we\u2019ve got on each other. However i used the event to defend myself. He did apologise for badmouthing me but not to the fact that he blamed me for all of the mess even though i was not the one who solely contributed to it. I feel like it is unfair. Now i dont even feel comfortable walking around the house especially when he is around because it makes me feel like i am not actually welcomed and that none of my effort appreciated. \n\nI feel like moving out since i dont think i have the rights to make him move out. i know it will hurt my boyfriend\u2019s feelings which i really want to avoid but i cant just keep living in fear like this. Everytime i overhear this guy says my name i get anxious. Aimta for leaving the mess? Aimta for wanting to move out? Should i even move out?",

They really don't want her to ever be disappointed and they'd always ask me to skip stuff or give up something so she could do something else or have something else.\n\nExamples of that. If we both got invited to birthday parties on the same day they'd ask me to skip it so she could go to the other, instead of just dropping us off at the different parties. If it was my turn to pick where we ate for dinner and I wanted my favorite, and she complained, they'd ask me to let her pick, even though I didn't like her favorite either. But she was younger and a girl so they thought it was okay. If we went on vacation or to the amusement park close to our town, they'd ask if I minded going last so she could go on rides or do what she wanted to do, and then they'd just never get around to mine. Then if I was given candy or something and she liked it, I'd be asked to give it to her. I did say no sometimes but I was either told I was an older sibling and should or they ignored my no and did what they wanted to anyawy.\n\nBecause of this my sister expected this and she became so spoiled. It only got worse when I started babysitting two years ago and making money. I was asked to buy her something she wanted or to give her some money. And of course saying no was a waste of time again.\n\nMy sister needs braces now. She doesn't want the regular ones. I was told she's not getting Invisalign either but there's some special braces she won't mind wearing but they cost a lot. She complained when our parents said they didn't have the money and she complained so hard that she even said they shouldn't give me anything for Christmas this year to afford it. So of course my parents asked me if I was okay with not getting a gift this year so she could have those braces. I started to say no and they started talking over me so I said you basically fuck you and do what you want because I don't count. My sister was trying to say something about it and I pointed right at her face and told her to stop fucking talking to me. I called her a spoiled and selfish brat and I said I don't want her to be my sister, I said I'm older but it doesn't mean she should always come first. She argued back at first and I told her to fucking stay away from me and she can fuck off with our parents. I was mad.\n\nMy parents tried to yell at me that same night but I was so mad they stopped. But the next day they told me snapping at my sister was wrong and I shouldn't say yes if I mean no. So I said no and they said saying no doesn't work. I told them to fuck off. They took my stuff for over a week for talking to them like that and they lectured me again for taking it out on my sister.\n\nAITA?",

      "selftext": "**Original Post** \n\nThrowaway because my girlfriend knows my main. I (44M) have two kids (18M & 16M) from a previous relationship. My ex has another kid (14F). My sons have always been very loving and dotting big brothers to their sister. Their sister's dad died when she was 4. I am not her dad, but I felt for her. I grew up as the only kid of my parent's union with half siblings and I was treated like an outsider. So, when he died, I stepped into a sort of \"uncle\" role for her. All three kids go to a rather expensive private school. I pay the tuition for all three.\n\nI have been dating my GF (37F) for 3 years. He has lived with me for the last year. She works at the school and has two kids there (13F & 10M). The pay is terrible, but a perk is that she gets a pretty steep tuition discount (as do all employees). Her ex pays the remainder tuition, plus child support, for their kids.\n\nWell, her ex's business imploded awhile back and he had a significant decrease in his income. They went to court and the court decreased his child support significantly. He also is no longer paying the remainder. This means my GF needs to make it up or kids go to public school. That isn't really possible for her.\n\nShe asked me to help, I refuse. I have a strict budget I keep to every month. If this was a true emergency, I would help, but it isn't. She then said I could simply switch the money I pay for \"my ex's daughter\" to her kids and that would allow me to pay. I refuse to do that. She is staying with her parents and hasn't talked to me in a week.\n\nAITA?\n\n**Update**\n\nWell, one of the comments on the original post really struck a nerve with me. It talked about how my GF's insistence that my kids' sister go to public school, but her kids cannot, really revealed her character. We have had some follow-up discussions. Basically, she insisted that my kids' sister isn't **my** family, so if anyone is going to benefit from my money it should be my kids or potential stepkids. I told her that I think she is being harsh to a child, and that she can be so cavalier about a child who has only one parent makes me want to break up. So, I made the decision to break up. She is moving out in a month. Likely, her kids will have to go public school in a different district because the few apartments in our district are way too expensive for her. She is pissed and asked me to resconsider multiple times. I think this is for the best. She asked if she could use my address so they could go to the local public school next semester. My understanding is that can potentially be considered fraud and land me in legal trouble, so I said \"no.\" She says not only am I forcing her kids to change schools mid school year, they will have to go to a school where they do not know any kids. They at least are friends with kids in the local public schools. ",

During the summer after graduation I had started seeing a different girl also from my hometown about 2 months later, we\u2019ll call her P (19F). The dynamic between P and I was strange, it wasn\u2019t sexual or romantic in nature, it was almost like we were just friends that had a crush on eachother and didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nOnce I left for college that fall P and I lost contact with eachother. C and I ended up reconnecting like 3 or 4 months later, and eventually got back together.\n\nDuring the time that C and I were back together (about a year), I never heard the end of the fact that I had hung out with P over that summer. Despite the fact that I hadn\u2019t spoken to P once during my relationship with C, It felt as if I was constantly expected to feel some sort of guilt for my past with her.\n\nQuestions like \u201cif we break up are you just gonna hang out with her again?\u201d Became a pretty common point of discussion with C, and eventually due to other things going on in my life I couldn\u2019t cope with the stress that was being in this relationship, and we ended up breaking up.\n\nFast forward about a month and a half to right now, and I had been enjoying single life, and working on myself. I had no intention of reconnecting with P, however we ended up running into eachother at a party when we were both back in our hometown, and we have since been talking quite a bit. One night when we were with a group of friends she tried making a move on me, which I declined because I have been feeling some guilt about the fact her and I have reconnected.\n\nShould I feel guilty about this?\n\nWas it healthy for C to ask me on many occasions about my intentions in the case that we broke up?\n\nHow do I maneuver this guilt, because I think that I will encounter it no matter who I am with?\n\nTL:DR\nI was in a relationship where I was constantly asked if I would get with a specific other person in the instance we broke up, we\u2019ve since broken up and me and the specific other person have regained contact and I don\u2019t know how to handle the guilt I\u2019m experiencing\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "Hi guys first time posting here but this is genuinely the first time me and my friends are frustrated with something. To sum it up, our friend group always celebrate our annual Christmas Party somewhere. We happened to stumble this resort it has a good atmosphere and food based on pictures and videos. Because of that we decided to reserve a ktv room for 25 people. We contacted their customer service to confirm our reservation. Glow and behold they responded by showing us their hourly rates and pictures of their ktv rooms. We decided to ask if KTV room 5 was available because we really liked the design of it and 30 minutes later they responded with only KTV 4 was available so me and my friends agreed to go for it anyways because the place was really hard to miss out on. The customer service themselves said that there was an AVAILABLE slot for December 14 and my friend who was talking to them agreed on that date. The following day they decide to send us a form we have to fill up and their rules and regulations. We filled up the form and they suddenly said that there are no more available rooms for that date?? They said that we need to pay a down payment in order for the reservation to go through like what? We literally agreed on that date the day before and they drop this to us rn? Obviously frustrated we said that we agreed on the date and the room but they said they do not give confirmation unless down payment was made but in the form there was NO evidence of any number because we use GCASH to pay and obviously we need their number in order to actually pay but NO THERE WAS NO NUMBER GIVEN AT ALL IN THE FORM MEANING PAYING FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT IS GENUINELY IMPOSSIBLE. So my friend replied and I quote \"Pardon me for being rude, but this is unfair to me as the customer since you didn't inform me sooner about the registration form because how will I send the date and time without it? when I confirmed my reservation I had to ASK for the form, do you get it? Not only that, but you said in the rules & regulations that on quote \"You may pay your reservation fee via Gcash or bank transfer.\" But then you are saying that you do not send gcash numbers or qr codes so that your customers reserving online can proceed with their down payment? honestly that doesn't make any sense. And lastly you're gonna say that you do not give confirmation unless down payment is done but you don't even make it possible for your customers to actually PAY.\" We were really pissed at first but after the customer service seened our message, they BLOCKED my friends account who was talking with them. Despite trying to criticize and explain to them properly, they decide to block us without explanation. And that is why we really wanted to review bomb this place but I want to ask for yall's opinion. Thanks for reading this far if ever you did.",

Right before leaving, she told me not to tell my family or someone else at home about my relationship, after all, I should wait till see if \"we were gonna last\", after all, with might not anyway. I got so sad and mad because, what kind of friend tells you that? That she doesnt think your relationship's gonna work. At the end I told my parent and they were ok with it, and we still together.\n\nWe didn't see each other much after the summer, but one of our conversations when we came back was her, not happy, that I told people about it, and when I talk about how my family accepted him, she didn't say anything bad, but I could felt something was wrong.\n\nWeeks later, I was talking with a friend, the kind that it's always for you and supporting, so I told him my doubts, that I felt like she wasn't happy about it and the things she did back there, and his answer surprised me and made me sad, he said: \"I'm glad you're not with her su much now, she's always been like that to you and you didn't even noticed\" he told me how she used to say how I wasn't  smart, but actually dumb (ironically I have better grades), how after an exam she tried to dismissed my note and how I was just lucky, and even used to tell people that I liked her ex bf back when they were dating (something she told me once, but didn't say that she told everyone, just that she was sure of it) and that was a lie, I never liked him, just tolerated him because of her, but she never believed me, so that kind of hurt me more, that she wanted so hard to believe that I was jealous of her and wanted her ex.\n\nMore weeks later we met in person again because of a school event, and she just talked about her, something I realized she used to do a lot, but ignore it before, and when someone mentioned going to the same country we went and meet someone there, like me, she laughing said not to, that he should look in another country, better people than then ones ww met there, no one laughed with her and I was kind of offended, what was the point of remarking that when I was next to her?\n\nDuring these months my birthday came, but I didn't do anything, I went out with my family to eat a day before it, and in my actual birthday I was home playing online video games with my bf, but she got offended cuz I didn't invite her to something never existed, and now I discovered that she's organizing a party and doing it low key so I wouldn't figure out, flash news, I did.\n\nNow, I'm conflicted because I felt like she never really cared about our friendship, I saw her trying hard with people who treated her horrible, trying to talk to them, but then coming back and playing victim because they didn't care, and now she tried zero talk with me, but telling people (mutual friends) how I don't want to talk to her, even though I tried to tell her stuff and start a conversation before, but she gave me general responses that you get from a standard email.\n\nI'm terrible dealing with emotional stuff, but, AITA for really not wanting to try and talk to her after everything I discovered or am I exaggerating?",

I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which is a shitty disorder, and I'm not gonna go into specifics here, but basically one of my compulsions is that I'm constantly using hand sanitiser on my hands after I touch people/stuff, or I clean my things after they've touched other things. It's pretty bad, and affects me quite a lot.\n\nSo, she's picked up on my constant sanitising, and asked my about it,  to which I said was none of her business, because it isn't. I thought she'd just leave me alone after, cus honestly any decent person would. But then she kept asking about it, mocking me to her friends, and keeps touching me and my stuff, despite it clearly bothering me, for like the whole of this school term. \n\nAnyway last lesson she was really awful to me, and I'd had a shit day, the intrusive thoughts were relentless and I just wanted to get through last periods history lesson and go home. But of course not, because she kept fucking taking my things, and laughing about how I kept sanitising again and again. I wanted to cry, and I just snapped. I stood up, basically yelled at her that she was an ignorant fucking c*nt who should keep her useless mouth shut. I also said a couple other nasty things, before I walked out and slammed the door shut. \n\nThe teacher caught up with me, yelled a bit and send me to the head teachers office. My parents were called and were furious, and keep telling me that my mental illness isn't an excuse to be rude.

      "selftext": "My boyfriend (34 M) and I (24 F) live separately, but he only lives down the street from me. I am a very independent person and always have been. Ever since I met him, we clicked and it was practically love at first sight for me. I met him when I was 18 turning 19 and everything was great for about a year and a half (if i remember the timeline correctly) until I was SA'd by my father at 19. I told my boyfriend what happened and of course he felt terrible that it happened to me. However, my sexual desires and preferences flipped like a switch, but our sex life continued as it had been. The sex was too frequent between my boyfriend and I, and we hadn't taken a break from sex even after i was assulted. This made me struggle to feel pleasure or even get aroused. This continued for weeks until I finally told him that our sex life was hurting me emotionally, mentally, and physically. He acknowledged my struggle, but it seemed like getting off was more important to him than my happiness and safety. After a long while of fighting for myself, sex turned unto something toxic. He would just go for it when I was sleeping, waking me in the worst way. He would beg me for sex even if I told him I can't do it because of my own health. I tried going through therapy for what happened between myself and my father and it helped tremendously. I have even forgiven my father for the steps he has taken to help himself and have me come back into his life as his daughter. However, by boyfriend has only \"changed\" a little bit since all of this started. He has stopped forcing himself on me, mostly, but still begs me for sex like its his lifeline or the only reason he's with me. He uses excuses as to why he deserves sex or \"how good he has been\" about it and he has earned some action. It has been 4 years now and I don't know why I'm still around. He isn't even really my \"boyfriend\" because he has horrible commitment issues but still doesn't wanna let me go, I'm so confused... After all these years I've only gotten worse. I've gained 25 pounds just being with him because he's unhealthy, I've lost my sex drive all together and I believe I've become mostly a-sexual because of my experiences and trauma. I've told him I don't love him the same and even told him \"I don't love you anymore\" several times. Yet he still won't let me go, guilt trips me for not giving him sex, even guild tripping me for not wanting to spend time with him. I see him at least once a week if not almost every day and he always uses \"we are best friends\" to guilt me into seeing him or doing things for him. I've wanted to end this all for so long and don't know how to do it. My heart is too soft and maliable for his guilt tripping and it makes me always fall back like a fool. It doesn't help that he lives so close. I've told him to date other girls and have sex with other people so he can leave me alone but none of that has worked. We argue all the time. During these arguments, I usually just want to leave and take time to cool down instead of yelling at eachother. Sometimes he will stand un front of the door and prevent me from leaving until i push past him. One time he literally kicked me out after pushing past him by putting his foot against my backpack and pushing me out of the doorway (not hard, but still). I don't want things to get worse or progress to physical abuse. I know I'm being abused mentally and sexually, I just don't know how to stop it permanently. I'm just suffering at this point and don't know if I'm in the wrong for falling out of love. ",

She had a group of best friends (group of 4 including herself) who threw her out of the group because she stopped wearing the friendship bracelet given by her then best friend. Me and her knew each other back then and once this issue came up, she wanted to stay with me and my best friend, (18F) Vivian. Me and Vivian were more than happy to have Tina with us, because she genuinely seemed like she needed someone to talk to. We were there for her all the time. \n\nSoon, 2024 came up and we were busy with our semsters, Tina grew comfortable with us and we became a trio. But, she always had a problem with Vivian, Vivian and her never saw eye to eye and I was kind of torn in between them, because most of the time when they fight, I would sort it out but deep down I always felt like Vivian's point of view made a lot more sense than Tina's. But I never told it out loud to any of them. Time went by and there was a time where Vivian made a mistake and Tina took this as an opportunity to bash her, it caused everyone a huge mental stress and soon it resulted to Vivian cursing both of us out and wanted to stay away from Tina. Tina pretty much took charge of the issue and it resulted in us breaking the friendship with Vivian, that was my mistake. I should have never done that, but at the time, both me and Tina were stuck in a turmoil because of something Vivian had done, which I know she didn't mean to eventually but I didn't sta d up for her. \n\nWe stopped talking to Vivian, Tina started being more assertive about me, she started ordering and demanding that I give her all my attention and not anyone else, I wasn't even \"allowed\" to talk to others regarding academics or sports, I waa well known in my university for being good  in all fields and hence I know a lot of people. Whenever I was seen talking to others or even coming with them to the class, Tina was rage out and wouldn't talk to for that day. It became to the point where it was draining me and I realised this wasn't how a friendship should feel like. Soon our places changed and I was made to sit with her ex best friend (whom she started talking to again btw) and another friend of mine, I was cautious on not talking much to her ex best friend and rather focused talking to my friend beside me. Tina didn't like that. She started being passive aggressive about it and always made some meekly comments like \"oh looks like you have settled there\",\"looks like u they like you\" etc. It came to the point where Tina once blantely ignored me the whole day and I reached my limit and stopped approaching her and started being with the people who actually wanted my company. Tina didn't like that, I didn't care. Soon I stopped waiting for her at the university entrance and set boundaries. Tina sent me a bunch of long text messages calling me a manipulator, gaslighter, fake and an attention seeker. I was pretty much taken aback by her tone and these msgs and told her to mind her words. She replied with \"if you are triggered then I am right and you are wrong.\" This always happened, whenever we had a issue which we could have sorted out,she would always reply with \"I'm right and you are wrong\". She was always rude and she called it being brutally honest or just really straight forward. Whenever I try to solve things with others, she would butt in and say that I'm sugar coating stuff and just ruin the whole thing. \n\nNeedless to say, after being called a fake person by the person who I considered as a sister, I firmed down and said that it would be better if we stay at a distance and not interact much, for which she replied with \"oh so now you are confident that you have around you, sure (my name) sure.\" I was just speechless how she just changed her whole personality that day. She didn't want me to break the friendship and said that she as my \"best friend\" (which she didn't like calling me that when I am in a good spotlight, only when it's in a bad spotlight) would never wanted to accuse me for nothing unless and until I am that of what she told. She told that I should take accountability for my mistake and apologise to her. She didn't want me gone but she still didn't want me to not talk to people, when she could talk to anyone and everyone, only I was the one restricted to it. \n\nSoon after I cut things off with her, she jumped to another group and became close to them, but that group also left her and she had no one but her first ex best friend to suck up to, she is right now in their group and is spreading things about me, not that I care since I have enough screenshots of her threatening me to back myself up, but there's still thus lingering thought that maybe I might the asshole, so AITA ???

I (f25) and my fianc\u00e9 (m25) had our baby 2 months ago (together for 5 years) and in the same week I gave birth to her, my mom(f49) had a work accident and spent nearly two weeks at the hospital. The issue is, my mom is very debilitated (even tho she got a lot better already) and needs assistance for a lot of things and my father(m52) always have been short tempered and doesn't have a lot of patience with her and my mom complains a lot about him to me and my sister (f28). He's been mistreating my mom and my sis already told him that if he keeps up with this behavior she won't hesitate to kick him out (the house is my mom's property) and i told my fiance (I shouldn't have tell him but I needed to talk to someone the day I told him about it, as my sister asked me to keep this matter private as she dealt with our dad) and he said that he didn't wanted our daughter near my father and I complied. But as I'm on maternity leave can spend more time with my mom than my sister, I go over there everyday to help my mom cooking  and helping her with her make up (she always loved to look her nicest and is the least I can do for her) and sometimes I need my father to help me with my baby so I can give fully attention to my mom. It caused a lot of tension between me and my fianc\u00e9, and he didn't spent a lot of time with me alone. I know he has a say in parenting as much as me but I can't rely on him to take care of our daughter during the day cuz he works in another town and she is on that phase when she wants to be held all the time and my mom needs me. Even tho all of that i just said, my dad is an amazing grandpa to all of his 3 grandkids so i know I can trust him with my baby but i understand where my fiance's concerns come from as his late father was abusive towards his late mother. So, AITAH for letting my daughter spend time with my dad against my fiance will? Advice will be very appreciated. \n",

She  has a baby now and stays at home don\u2019t work and her rent is 2 months due and the baby daddy doesn\u2019t help her well financially because he don\u2019t want to be involved in her life as he informed her already at the start that he\u2019s married to two wives( he\u2019s a Moslem ) and has kids already so didn\u2019t want anything  serious with her. She later on conceived and decided to keep the baby even after numerous requests from  the man to abort(which I\u2019m happy  she has a lovely baby) She recently came out and told me to buy an iPhone for  her such that she can resume her online selling of clothes. I told her that\u2019s ok, I will get the phone on  credit in my name and info and she can pay for it in monthly installments x4 . She refused because she said she couldn\u2019t afford that monthly payment as it was too much for her. I came up with another idea that let\u2019s get a cheaper Samsung which can help u for the start of your online selling and later on u can upgrade. She refused because she says all her information is on iCloud and therefore she needs an iPhone ( she had iPhone 7 which her baby spoilt). I still told her to ask half of the money from Her baby daddy and I will contribute half too and she can pay it later. She still refused because the man doesn\u2019t give her money anymore and don\u2019t pick her calls .  She wants me to buy the phone and give it to her and she can pay anytime  with any mount she has , I also refused   because I can\u2019t buy her an expensive phone of which she has no job and I\u2019m not sure if I will be paid and besides i can\u2019t be wasting my hard earned money like that over  a non productive issue .

They\u2019ve always been adamant that I pursue a \u201creal\u201d career like business or medicine. I\u2019ve known since high school that art was my passion, and despite their disapproval, I stuck with it. I put in countless late nights, worked part-time jobs to cover tuition, and stayed committed to my dream. My parents never really acknowledged my effort; instead, they\u2019d say things like, \u201cWhen are you going to realize this is just a hobby?\u201d or \u201cDo you really expect to make money from this?\u201d\n\nIt all came to a head a few months ago when I got my first big internship with a well-known gallery. I was so proud and thought it would be a turning point for them, but when I told them, they just shrugged and said, \u201cThat\u2019s nice, but don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d\n\nFast forward to now \u2014 my graduation is around the corner, and I\u2019m excited to celebrate with friends and my little brother. I decided to send my parents an invitation, but they never responded. So, I finally called them and said, \u201cAre you planning to come?\u201d They were surprised and said they weren\u2019t sure if they could make it. When I asked why, they told me they didn\u2019t think a graduation in art was something worth celebrating. They implied they\u2019d rather not be there than support my \u201cunrealistic\u201d path.\n\nI was hurt, but then I got mad. I told them I didn\u2019t want them to come at all if they didn\u2019t actually want to be there. I said I wanted to surround myself with people who believed in me and were proud of me, not people who\u2019ve spent years making me feel like my choice was a mistake. They said I was being dramatic and that it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but now they\u2019re upset and claiming I\u2019m making them feel unwelcome.\n\nI feel conflicted. I know they\u2019re my parents, and they\u2019ve done a lot for me, but I can\u2019t ignore the fact that they\u2019ve never supported my passion. It hurts that they can\u2019t see my graduation as a moment of achievement, regardless of my career choice. I\u2019ve talked to friends who say I have every right to feel this way, but some say I\u2019m overreacting and should let them be a part of this milestone.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for refusing to let my parents come to my graduation because they never supported my career choice?",

      "selftext": "I'm the eldest of 3, but also the step-child/half-sibling. Growing up I spent most of the time at my moms, and every other weekend with my dad, step mom, and siblings. There was a lot of abuse at my dad's house, and I felt like the target a lot of the time, but the extended family like my step moms parents, aunts, uncles, etc. always treated me like one of their own.\n\nI was the first to have kids, and everyone showered them with love and affection as they often do with the first-born grandchildren, but when my niece was born (brother's daughter) there was a huge shift. Suddenly nobody in the family could visit me, they were all too busy or too far... though nobody's living situation had changed, and some of them had actually moved closer to my step mom and siblings, and by proxy, me (I'm in the city, they're all a little further north). I haven't seen most of the family since the baby shower for my niece over 2 and a half years ago, and anyone I have seen it's because I have reached out to them and made the 2+ hour drive. Needless to say, it's a little bit upsetting. People that used to visit constantly and be actively involved in mine and my children's lives seemingly vanished.\n\nA couple months ago my step mother's mom (or \"nana\") called me while I was at work, and then texted me and asked me to have my kids FaceTime her. I told her I was working and asked if everything was okay, at which point she said she wanted to ask them if they wanted to go away for the weekend. Now, maybe I'm crazy, but I think at 7 and 9 years old their mom should maybe be asked first, before a relative they hardly see invites them on a weekend away. I told her I didn't like how she approached it, and that I would like to be involved in planning of such things. I also reminded her that my children deserve consistency from the people in their lives, and simply dropping in once a year to take them on a fancy trip was not acceptable in my eyes. Again, maybe that's just me. I asked her to please look at things from my side, and stop discrediting me as their mother, or else remove herself... she chose the latter and blocked me. She then proceeded to visit with my children without my knowledge when they were spending the weekend with my step mom, which I knew was a possibility but having it confirmed left a sour taste with regards to my step mom (who also gave them an energy drink, knowing both children had/have heart issues, and when I voiced my displeasure she told them that I was angry but it \"didn't matter\"). After months of stewing, I finally reached out to my step mom and said she would only be seeing the boys under my supervision moving forward, and was immediately accused of emotional blackmail. Mind you, this isn't *just* because they're all inconsistent figures in my children's lives and constantly undermine my authority \u2014 it's because after years of being treated terribly in comparison to my flesh and blood siblings, I don't feel like possibly subjecting my children to the same behaviour, and the fact that they're all not only flakey but disrespectful to me as their mother says that, in my eyes, the possibility of my children experiencing the same mistreatment is far too real. How can I expect them to respect my children when they've never done that for me? And isn't part of respecting my children respecting their mother? Also note: I'm a single mom, so discrediting their only parental figure like that could, in some extremes, prove detrimental.\n\nSo, AITAH if I cut these people off entirely?",

I have one child and they love to pretend they are the worlds greatest grandparents (example: telling their friends how involved they are [they aren\u2019t], telling them how many toys they buy for him [they don\u2019t] and always forcing him to take pictures with them so they can show their friends. They have never been alone with him (child is 15 months old) and likely never will because neither know how to watch a child. They passed me off to family until I was older, so they don\u2019t understand feeding a child, putting them in a car seat, what you can and can\u2019t give them, diaper changes, etc. More examples of this are giving him sharp objects, breakable objects, small objects that can easily be swallowed and getting upset with me when i take them from him because he tries to swallow them or i know that he will hurt himself with it, not wanting to put him in a car seat because it\u2019s \u201ctoo much, he will be fine on a lap\u201d,  my father giving him pop yesterday and then lying to my face after i seen him do it and telling me i am a witch for not letting him have soda, getting upset that we don\u2019t give him juice (only water/ breastmilk) because they want to be fun grandparents and give him sugary drinks. When i ask them to not do things like this, they say things like \u201coh we are terrible grandparents we\u2019re just such bad grandparents because we want him to love us\u201d.  I have already told them they won\u2019t be able to watch him if his father and I aren\u2019t present because of the things they do/try to do, and they just say things like \u201coh one day you\u2019ll need us and you\u2019ll be begging us to watch him\u201d. it\u2019s to the point where everytime we go to visit them (they only live 15 mins away so we do see them frequently, but he doesn\u2019t enjoy being around them) I dread being around them and can\u2019t wait until we leave. Am I being an asshole child? They have done a lot for our family (monetarily wise) but another thing they never let us forget is how they\u2019ve given us money/ purchased us things, no matter how grateful we are they still feel the need to remind us they have helped us out with money before. I have tried biting my tongue, giving them boundaries, being stern, telling them things lovingly, trying to let them off the hook and be easy on them because in a way they have never \u201cparented\u201d a young child before but I am not sure what to do anymore.

We met at college, and for a quick context, our friendship was one of those where we instantly clicked and it turned out we both had a crush on each other, but were too damn shy to tell the other and we drifted apart, so much so that we didn't talk for over a year afterwards, even though we still had classes together.\n\nFast forward to a year after that, and I had already gotten into a relationship, and for school reasons I had to text her for a group work. We started catching up and among other things, we talked about the elephant in the room, and things quickly turned sour and bitter, cause she revealed to me the fact that she had a crush on me, and vice versa, and it didn't end up well (I got blocked and didn't talk for YET another year).\n\nBy this point, during the pandemic, in 2021, after a whole year without talking, she texted me, and again we caught up, and finally stablished a somewhat functioning friendship. But she asked me on the condition that we'd be \"online friends\". In this time, mostly through text, there have been times when she has shown concern over me, or thrown in advice, texted first (which is not the norm but sometimes happens), asked me for a handful of IRL favors, and a couple times even felt a little flirty towards me.\n\nMy problem comes when, three years after that, after things have normalized and we've been back to campus, I feel she acts weird towards me, cause we often talk through text, but I can count in one hand the irl interactions we've had, she's soon to graduate, and I feel like shit, not only cause she ignores me when literally walking by me, but because she got ahead and will graduate before me, and I have often felt I'm not worthy of her since I got ser back so much, like, we're leagues apart.\n\nI've wanted to talk to her but as of late she's also distant through text messages, and I can't help but feel like I am the problem, so, what can I do in this situation?\n\nSo, WIBTAH if I decided to go up and talk to her? What should I do?\n\nTL;DR: WIBTAH if I confronted my friend, who I've got history with, over her only acknowledging me through text but not in person?",

He is about 14 and still in middle school. We are completely different people. I don\u2019t enjoy talking or playing games with him because of the age gap and how immature he is. He is constantly texting me and spamming me invites on Xbox.\n\nWhen I play games with him I feel like I have to turn off most of my personality. I just generally feel weird playing games and talking with someone that much younger than me. I don\u2019t enjoy any time I have playing games with him. I would so much rather be talking to my other friends.\n\nI have told him before that he doesn\u2019t need to send so many invites. I\u2019ve tried to set a boundary by saying I don\u2019t have much time to play games because I\u2019m in college, and when I am playing games it\u2019s just to unwind and not play with people. He respected it for a few weeks and has now returned to spamming me daily.\n\nI want to just block him on everything and finally cut him off. But there\u2019s this part of me that feels so conflicted with that. He really does just want to play games and talk to me and I\u2019m a little upset at myself for how annoyed I feel with him. But he has also just been totally oblivious. \n\nI\u2019ve given him every reason to stop trying to talk to or invite me by either saying I can\u2019t play games or talk, or more recently, by not responding at all.

Last year, she was in a toxic relationship with her ex (also my friend at the time). He cheated on her, blamed her, and they kept reconnecting despite the toxicity.

When I confronted him, he sent hateful messages, which led to a breakdown where I almost harmed myself. My friends intervened, but Ashley, despite living nearby, didn\u2019t show up.\n\nRecently, Ashley moved schools, found new friends, and became distant. She often talked about her ex or praised her new friend, \"Della,\" who is wealthy and does things with Ashley that I\u2019d suggested before but was always declined.\n\nThe last straw was a planned weekend where Ashley was supposed to stay over.

She told me they were accepting, but that they didnt know about me yet, and that she would have to tell them soon. This was our first Thanksgiving together, and we decided to visit her family for Thanksgiving instead of mine, since I had already introduced her to my family but I hadn't been introduced to hers. \n\nShe seemed very wary of me going to Thanksgiving, and I asked her if they were accepting, and she said yes, but that they would take a while to warm up to me. I brushed it off as nervousness, but I did not know the extent of what I was about to get myself into. \n\nWe agreed on this a few weeks before Thanksgiving, and the day finally comes. She picks me up, we get to her parents house, and suddenly she brushes off any affection I try to give her. No kiss before we get out of the car, she rejects me holding her hand as we walk in, and she can barely make eye contact with me. At this point, im anxious, unsure of if I have done something wrong. Everything is made clear as I walk through the door and see her parents for the first time ever in person. \n\nThey say that I must be the *friend* that my girlfriend told them about. I look to my girlfriend, confused as hell, and she gives me the most apologetic look she can muster. The whole night goes by in a blur, as my girlfriend avoids my confused, upset, and angry looks. Her family are all convinced that I'm just a friend of hers, yet she doesn't correct them. She brushes me off, and I try to keep myself together and put on a brave face so I don't make a scene. \n\nAfter the night was over, I asked what that situation was. I told her she lied to me, and told me that her family was accepting and that she would tell them about me. She said, and I quote, \"yeah, but I didn't say when I would tell them we were together.\" This made me very angry, and i told her that she could find another girlfriend that is willing to be led on and that if she can't tell her family about me, then it's obvious this isn't worthy of a long term commitment. I felt lied to, blindsided, and led on. \n\nFor the past week, I've been a mess. Some of my friends say that I shouldn't have blown up like that, and that maybe she panicked and lied, and word spread, but I don't know. I feel like she could have at least told me. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\nTLDR: Girlfriend doesn't tell her family that she has a girlfriend, leading me to walk in on her families Thanksgiving unknowing that I'm supposed to act like a \"friend.\" ",

I always am silent when she says it because I fear retaliation from her if I were to say no. Especially because she has talked to me in private about people who \u201cwronged\u201d her years ago and it makes me feel like she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do something to me or my career if I were to openly object to her comments. On top of that she will talk ill of me in private by criticizing my skills but never offering insight on how to improve when I ask or yell at me over the phone sometimes about issues that have nothing to do with work or me (yet she finds a way to take stress out on me), while simultaneously telling everyone in our department how great I am when we are in public.\n\nI reported her behavior to the Dean and they held a meeting with her and I assumed that her behavior would stop. For a couple weeks it did and then she went back to the old behaviors. I\u2019m hesitant to leave because I\u2019m worried that by leaving her lab while I have two unfinished manuscripts means that this would look very badly on me. That I would be seen as the AH. I do not plan to be sharing her behaviors in a formal report at this time nor do I want to talk about it around the department so I wouldn't have much of a defense for why I am leaving. Other labs have already told me they don\u2019t want to upset her and would need permission from her for me to work in their lab. I feel like there\u2019s a chance that if I quit that I will be seen as irresponsible, poor work ethic, and an AH for not finishing the work expected of me. Fortunately the two papers dont have many authors on it. It's myself, my supervisor, and another faculty at this time. So it's not a situation where an incomplete paper means a detriment to another student. But I know leaving unfinished work can be seen as an AH move, so it's hard for me to imagine not being looked at as the AH by the rest of the department, or others students that don't know me well, for just up and leaving her lab. So WIBTA for leaving now?\n\n  \nTLDR: My supervisor/teacher is telling me things that make want to leave their lab but I'm worried that leaving now will make me look like an AH.",

I (20M) know that my family likes that day, but I'm not close to them and in general we don't do pretty much anything, just eat and then they start to talk about politics and conspiracies (not the interesting ones) so I grab my phone and play videogames, that's literally all my days during Christmas. \n\nLast year the same date I spent the day in my gf's house and night with my family, so when they invite me I think I could go after the dinner with my family. Told my mom a week ago and she said yes. \n\nIt's December 7th, I remind my mother about my gf's house and she start insulting and yelling at me very aggressive and rude (I think she forgot), I try to stay calm (because all the screams and insults are literally a thing of every day, she always is searching for a thing to insult me and I'm done with fighting back) but all the thing causes my grandmother getting fisical pain (she took a pill and now she's ok) and because of that my uncle stars yelling me as well. Everyone says that I ruined Christmas, my mom took way all the decorations and we are in our rooms without talking. I live with her and all years we go to my grandma's home they start fighting, but I think it's the first time that is my fault. AITA?",

We rented the house together and both put equal amounts into the house with both our names on it and it's been amazing to actually have a house and for my baby to have his own room.\n\nAnyways my boyfriends parents like to invite them self's around sometimes and due to my anxiety I have made a boundary with my boyfriend that his family need to let me know if the would like to come over (it's the same with my own family) \n\nNormally my boyfriends mother has her grandson  that's 2 years old with her becasue her daughter and his dad both work and every time they are over the 2 year old rummages  in my bags and my sons things, he even tried to open some of the presents I had wrapped the night previously for ny family and shouted \"NO! NO! MINE! ALL MINE! GO AWAY!\" when I told him they went for him, even my boyfriends mom told him no and he went on a temper tantrum around my living room pulling all my sons toys out and throwing them.\n\nThe thing is this kid really like chocolate and my son has a milk allergy... this brat smeared his fingers over every surface he could making me have to wipe it all down and wash plastic toys... the worst part is after I cleaned  up I felt a bit ill so I took my sleeping son upstairs and lay down with him for a bit whilst my boyfriend entertained his family.\n\nAfter a while he came upstairs and asked if I was okay and I felt a little better, he told me he cleaned up and I was happy since he really doesn't do much unless I ask him to.\n\nHe brought my son down stairs and lay him in the carpet as he began to make him a bottle. As I came down stairs I saw my son holding something and was about to put it in his mouth... it was a half eaten bit of chocolate. Apparently my boyfriend gave his nephew some chocolate whilst I was up stairs... (after I had wipes everything down already)\n\nI dived and grabbed the chocolate out of my sons hands and wipes his hands and arms down and then began to hoover and look for more after I out my son in his high chair.\n\nAfter that I politely asked my boyfriend that his nephew doesn't eat chocolate in our house anymore and he agreed.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I had the day off work and went to spend time with family just to come home and find chocolate finger prints sneared on my sons new sitting pillow...\n\nThem saw some of the presents I had wrapped missing from under the tree and thrown around the room (still wrapped thank god)\n\nI was annoyed and asked my boyfriend about it and he just shrugged saying his nephew wanted to play whilst they were Iver that afternoon...\n\nI kinda lost it becasue he knows of my sons allergy and yet still gave a 2 year old chocolate, the same 2 year-old that likes to smear it everywhere...\n\nAnd that the presents weren't his to touch in the first place since I had payed for all of them\n\nI sighed and told him to forget it and I tool the cover off the pillow...(It was a right pain) and put it in a baby safe wash....\n\nAfter this I told him I don't want his nephew over anymore if he's not going to listen to a clear boundary I put in place to keep my son safe...\n\nHowever now he's acting like I'm the a hole because 'I'm being mean to a 2 year old'",

      "selftext": "Sorry for any typos, English is not my first language. I'm ( F39) an executive at my own firm and serve medium to large clients ( this is important to the story). I started my business from zero. Before that, I was struggling to get the money for my career project and was poverty shamed by my ex, who preferred social status. I'm mentioning this because that painful experience stuck with me.\n\nIt took me years, but I managed to start my company and slowly built a name for myself. I've dated different kinds of men, from wealthy to blue collar. None of them gave me the vibe that I'm getting from my current ex-boyfriend. \n\nI met Donnie ( M38) at a community event. He approached me. I'm 100% sure that his face is familiar. He reintroduced himself, mentioned my ex high school dance partner Jay ( M39), and told me that he and Jay were best friends back in college. We eventually hit it off, and to be fair, I had my panties all twisted over him. I was happy to experience the excitement and feeling giddy. He began to introduce me to his family members, and he met my family. Honestly, we've never even had a fight, not even during disagreements.\n\nLast summer, he began to act dismissive of my past connections ( not romantic, but platonic friends). He showed disdain for my preferences regarding hypothetical questions like \u201cwhere would you go if you could time travel\u201d. I said I wanted to revisit my childhood friends, and he said I'm being miserable because I'm inviting a part in my life where I live in an underprivileged area. He also tried to rush me into composing myself after I got emotional from remembering someone ( not romantic). I found this odd. He talks about his childhood a lot and grew up in a lower class area, and his family members still work low income jobs ( just saying). \n\nA few weeks ago, he mentioned that he approached during the event where we connected because \u201c the who's who\u201d treated me like royalty. This is an exaggeration, and I wasn't flattered. It didn't feel good, and it was u settling, and I told him. He said that I'm over reacting.\n\nRecently, we were having sex and saying sexy things to each other, and he blurted out that he \u201cfelt protected\u201d with me. I don't know if im being judgemental, but it felt weird and very off. I'm totally up for being in a relationship where we mutually protect each other, but he and I aren't at that stage. We've only been together for 13 months, no talks about the future except for things that he wants to do, like owning a business.\n\nI have been researching him on  and half of three things he claims about his past that  don't check out ( I can't get any info on the University where he earned his MBA, he said he eloped ( ex wife) but also said his uncle the regional bishop married them). \n\nI tried to talk to him about my concerns, but I didn't really get any answers. I don't want to get into a situation where my role would be to serve someone or provide for them without even getting a heads up first.\n\nI spent Thanksgiving week out of town and didn't feel like I missed him, but that may be because my guard is up, and I'm trying not to get hurt.\n\nWe saw each other yesterday when we went for a walk. I put my concerns on the table. His face changed. I said I would really like this to work out, but I wanted to express that I will not agree to be anyone's leg up or their door to success. I did mention things that have hurt/bothered me and that all I want is clarity. He said that I'm bullying him and that I'm trying to embarrass him for having a low paying job. I tried to explain that his job is the least of my concerns as I'm not expecting him to financially support me, but he needs to come clean. I don't want a relationship with a man who only approached me because he might have seen an opportunity for clout. The next thing that happened kind of felt embarrassing. He tried to smile, but what came out was a weird facial expression. I left it at that since we had plans to watch movies at home. After a few hours, he was more relaxed and tried to initiate sex but I felt very uncomfortable. He said that I'm all about status and quickly walked away.  This is very erratic, and I don't appreciate it, so I broke up with him right this morning. He sent me a message telling me about how emotional affinity should be prevalent over money and career and how incredibly disappointed he is. He also said that his marriage ended because his ex in-laws sabotaged the relationship because they thought he wasn't good enough.\n\nMost of my inner circle thinks I was right to end things, while others are telling me that he must have felt like I was trying to treat him as less. AITA ?\n\n\nEdit: I'm worrying that I might inadvertently done the same that my poverty shaming ex did to me.\n\n",

      "selftext": "I (29F) have a bit of a family dilemma, and I\u2019m feeling conflicted about whether I\u2019m in the wrong here, so I\u2019d appreciate some perspective.\n\nI\u2019ve always had a good relationship with my sister (34F), but she\u2019s definitely the more spontaneous and disorganized one, and I\u2019m the more planned and responsible sibling. She has a 4-year-old daughter, Emma, and I absolutely adore my niece\u2014she\u2019s funny, sweet, and I love spending time with her.\n\nHere\u2019s the situation: Last week, my sister called me up around 2 p.m. and asked if I could come over and watch Emma for a few hours that evening because she and her husband (who I\u2019ll call Ben) had \"last-minute\" tickets to a concert. She said they\u2019d been planning this for months but didn\u2019t realize they had nobody to watch Emma until the day of.\n\nI was a little taken aback by the short notice but figured I could help out\u2014except for the fact that I already had plans that evening. I\u2019ve been juggling a lot at work, and I had promised myself a quiet night in to recharge, especially since I\u2019ve been feeling a little burned out lately. I told my sister I couldn\u2019t babysit because I already had plans, but she started to insist, saying she\u2019d really\u00a0*appreciate*\u00a0it and that Emma would be fine with me, she just needed someone to watch her for a few hours.\n\nI gently told her that I wasn\u2019t available, and that I thought it was a bit last-minute to be asking me to babysit in the first place. I also mentioned that I needed some downtime, as I\u2019ve been feeling pretty drained lately. That\u2019s when she got upset and started saying that I was being selfish and that family helps family. She said that she didn\u2019t have many other options and that this concert was important for her and Ben to unwind. She even threw in that I never seem to make time for her and Emma, and that this would be a perfect chance for us to bond.\n\nI ended up sticking to my decision and politely told her I couldn\u2019t help. I wasn\u2019t trying to be cruel, but I genuinely needed that time for myself.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s been texting me with passive-aggressive messages about how \u201cnice it is to know where I stand\u201d and \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to find someone else who\u00a0*actually*\u00a0cares about their niece.\u201d She also told me that she didn\u2019t realize I was so \u201cbusy\u201d and that if I\u00a0*really*\u00a0cared about her, I\u2019d prioritize her needs. She also mentioned that Ben\u2019s mom (who\u2019s not exactly close to me) had agreed to watch Emma last-minute, and I should have done the same.\n\nNow, I\u2019m feeling kind of guilty, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for me to want to keep my plans. I don\u2019t know what she expected\u2014especially with such little notice\u2014and I don\u2019t want to be taken for granted either.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to babysit my niece when it was last-minute and I already had plans?\n\n  \n**Edit after reading comments:**\n\nThank you all so much for the feedback! I really appreciate the perspectives and suggestions you\u2019ve shared.\n\nI want to clarify a few things because I realize some details weren\u2019t clear in my original post. First off, I absolutely love my niece\u2014she\u2019s amazing, and I adore spending time with her whenever I can. I also love my sister, but she\u2019s always been the type to leave things to the last minute and then rely on others to pick up the slack, especially when it comes to taking care of Emma. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been put in a situation where I\u2019m expected to drop everything because she\u2019s in a bind, and while I understand that life happens, it\u2019s been a pattern that\u2019s worn on me a bit.\n\nI know some of you suggested that I could have been more understanding, and I definitely see that side of it. I\u2019m not trying to be cold or unsupportive, but I\u2019ve been feeling really burnt out lately, and I had already made plans for some much-needed downtime. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to help; it just felt like the timing was off, especially given the last-minute request and the fact that I\u2019ve been juggling a lot of stress at work.",

I was planning on gathering their idea about autism and adhd over time and after a month (but not much info really) i was feeling confident that they'll be supportive, i wanted to tell my family about everything when we were talking about autism (ourr janitor's autistic daughter) when out of nowhere, my mom said quote on quote:\" it's unfortunate, at least crazy people are better than autistics, because they sometimes have some sense of control over themselves, autistics are just brain dead!\" i wanted to argue back but instead i shrunk into myself, ended the conversation and went to my room and never spoke to them about autism or adhd ever again. \n\nThree months ago, my brother kinda changed his job (from teaching to school office) & doing this, his job just became a lot more draining, he is also working on his master's dgree and he is struggling a lot with time management and i'm worried if he keep on doing this for long, he might get to the burnout stage, on one hand i know how invaluable a diagnosis he believes can be for getting through a the hard time and my mom's side comments (which are thing comung from ADHD and autism) on the lther hand, i'm worried about him getting defensive and believing the same thing as my mom, because that would not only be frustrating, bit it could also be the last straw for him.\n AITAH for not telling him about his diagnosis and what should i do to tell him",

      "selftext": "Hi there.\nI (28F) am at my wits end. I'm just tired. My boyfriend (28F) changes his attitude quicker than my mood swings and I don't know how to deal with it.\n\nThis morning he was super sweet cuddly and adorable, and while we were in the kitchen I was starting to make breakfast. \n\nI don't know if I do, but I highly suspect to have ADHD because I strain to focus on a task, if I happen to do one thing I struggle to do another or even completely forget about the one thing I was doing. This'll come in important later.\n\nSo while I was doing breakfast, I forced myself to make the times line up (e.g put bacon in first so I can make coffee while it cooks). My bf asked me when his coffee will be ready so my brain short-circuited and I started making coffee, completely forgetting to set the timer on the air fryer etc. \n\nTrying to be helpful he suggested he'd do the coffee, except I've got my own way of doing it and usually measure it with muscle memory (cafetiere). When I told him no thanks he immediately storms off saying \"The one time I try to help and it's not good enough!\" So I offered he could wash a cup or two and I just get a \"Oh so now you want my help?\" \n\nDefeated I give up, and I just carry on. Both in a bad mood, I asked him (tiredly) how many bacon rashers he'd like and he just says he doesn't care, doesn't want any. So I'm asking him ok do you want coffee? And he goes \"No don't fancy it anymore\"\n\nAnd I'm so. So tired. AITA for telling him no to help with the cafetiere? I'm just genuinely trying to see where I went wrong and where is attitude came from but even when I ask nicely he just shrugs and doesn't talk to me.",

      "selftext": "Hi!! For context, I (17-year-old F) am a high school junior and am really into the theatre. My school is doing the musical \"Frozen,\" and I was auditioning for Anna this year. I recently had a falling out with a couple of my best friends and currently don't have many friends in my grade. I played on my school's volleyball team this fall, where I met Natalie. She is 18 (Senior) and also really into theatre. For context, she's Jamaican with black curly hair and brown eyes. I'm white with brown wavy hair and blue eyes, so I kinda look like Anna. I texted her about the play, and she said she was also auditioning for Anna as well. No big deal.\n\nAuditions were about 3 days ago, and the cast list was released around 12 hours later. I got Anna, and she got the mom and a townsfolk for musical numbers. She was pissed. She texted me, screaming that she should've gotten the part about how our director was racist for casting me instead of her and how we should riot. This came out of nowhere as she seemed awkward and sweet. I was also confused because the girl who got Elsa was Indian and looked nothing like the movie version of Elsa. I told her she might be upset but shouldn't jump to conclusions because our school was very serious about that. (One of the past teachers got fired for an accusation of discrimination. the kid who accused her confessed it was a joke, and she still didn't get hired back.) As soon as I said this, Nat started calling me racist, an asshole, and \"This is why you have no friends, loser\" I was upset by this, obviously. I told her to calm down, or I was gonna tell the theatre teacher what she was saying before she could make an accurate accusation; she didn't and sent me a video of her emailing the head of school. I met with the theatre teacher the next day and showed her the texts of her calling my teacher a racist. She immediately sent an email recasting her role and kicked her out of the program. She is sending me D3ath Th3eats in my locker, and I wonder if I did the right thing. So, AITAH?",

      "selftext": "I love my boyfriend very much and have almost no complaints about him except one. We\u2019re in 10th grade now but at the time there was this girl in 8th grade we were both friends with, let\u2019s call her Sarah. We were both friends with her but me and my now boyfriend were not in the same friend groups. Just to clarify we were not dating then we only talked sometimes in classes and were friends. I had always liked my boyfriend, let\u2019s call him jimmy. Throughout middle school but never told anyone. One day Sarah was telling us how she liked Jimmy. I was a little disappointed to heard that since they were much closer friends than me and him were. But I never flirted or even talked to him outside and I definitely didn\u2019t try to pursue him after hearing that. Well my birthday party rolls around. It was a sleepover I could only invite so many girls over and Sarah didn\u2019t make into the couple I could pick, because we weren\u2019t very close. She texted me that night being aggressive asking why I didn\u2019t invite her, I tell her I could only invite so many girls. She starts telling me about how she\u2019s going to khs. Me obviously trying to be a good friend spends hours of my birthday sleepover talking her out of it. I later hear from a mutual friends of ours that she wasn\u2019t actually going to khs, but only said that to try to ruin my night. Now I get being upset over not being invited but I personally think she took it way too far. Anyways she was pissing other people off at school and was getting threats. So she moved schools that year. I got with my boyfriend Jimmy towards the end of 9th grade. Everything thing had being going great and it still is for the most part. Over the summer I had learned that he still had contact with Sarah on Snapchat. And they\u2019re friends on instagram and Facebook. My boyfriend has under 30 followers and following on instagram. And very little friends on Facebook. So it a little heartbreaking that she one the only girls he following and that they are that close. I don\u2019t think my boyfriend knows that I know she used to like him. But one night in the summer somehow we got on the topic of her and I expressed I didn\u2019t like her and what she did to me. He didn\u2019t really have much to say. I at least thought he would distance themselves. I didn\u2019t tell him to do that because I\u2019m just not a controlling person. Probably a few weeks after this we were on a date at six flags. We had gotten drinks and sat down at a table. And I just peek over and he\u2019s talking to Sarah. He noticed and just said that she usually just texts him randomly asking how he was doing. I was highly upset and that day and when I got home I cried. I didn\u2019t tell him I was upset because I didn\u2019t want to ruin our date. So I just kinda shoved into the back of my mind. This has always ate away at me. And for the first time recently I opened up to one of my friends about it. She told me that she knows how some girls think and if the guy is still texting her even though he has a girlfriend so still has a shot. And I mean it\u2019s been 2 years since she\u2019s moved schools and they\u2019re still in contact. I also feel that if my boyfriend told me that somebody did him wrong and would hold a grudge for him, but obviously he isn\u2019t doing the same for me. And to add on top of this he knows that she used to like him. My friend said that one day she saw like a insta post from Sarah and was talking bad about her and he defended her and said that she got him through a tuff time when he was dealing with suicidal thoughts. Now I appreciate her helping him but I help him now. I want to bring this up to him so bad but I\u2019m very non confrontational. Also my boyfriend is a very logical person so I think he would just justify the situation and defend her. And I don\u2019t know if my heart can sit through that. Am I in the wrong and should just let it go? Should i confront him? Any advice? Thank you for taking the time to read this.",

Before then he was a ghost, kids that I had known for years at school thought my father was dead. For parent teacher conferences I went alone. My sports matches I went alone. At home I was alone unless he was in a screaming match with my mom after coming home drunk. The only small interactions I had with him was when he would get angry and hit me. I only knew his name, face and occupation. But I know he had a good reason, he was making money for us. I know I should be grateful because some fathers don\u2019t do that. I know I should be grateful because he built a comfortable life for me but I\u2019m greedy. \n\nHe\u2019s more present now for my sisters after he was stuck with us during covid and after my health battle but for our relationship it\u2019s not the same.

I bought a few soaps\u2014good soaps, by the way\u2014but that was it.\n\nFast forward to my wedding: I asked him to be my best man because he was my best friend, and I was his best man when he got married.

It has been 2 months since I left my home to study at the college since it is far away and I am staying at the college hostel( which is not good but they still got a lot of money for staying here from us) . Since it is the dental field, apart from the fees, they are asking me to buy a lot of dental materials( which they already got extra fees for btw) which has cost me about 5000 rupees till now.. and a lot of other health tests, vaccines and shit (which comes roughly upto 7000 rupees).. all was okay until I started reading my physiology textbook .. it was issued by the college and it is  really vague. I inquired about it with my seniors and they told me to try another book which cost about 2000 rupees and I don't know any seniors well enough  to buy a second hand book. I have a laptop and I downloaded the pdf of the book but it feels like it would be better if I had the hard copy of the boon to study. I called and told my mom about this and she and my father (who was in speaker btw) started yelling at me telling that I spend more than 2000 rupees every week. I kind of get where they are coming from( my mom has this big operation for cataract coming which will  be covered by the insurance but the tests cost a lot too and the fees they paid for my college was about 4.5 lakh which actually included the 40000 rupees for dental materials but the college is not providing it now.. they told us to wait for it for 2 more months) . I am from a upper middle class family and we are not really struggling for money per se.. but it is just the tone they took with me and i am really in a bad place right now mentally.. being in a new place and all the study pressure is getting to me and i have not seen my parents for nearly 2 months now since the college is really far from home .

      "selftext": "To add context, politics is involved in this, but it is not the main factor. Please excuse grammar mistakes, I am not a talented writer. \n\nAll of this context was based on what both parents told me, what their friends noticed, and what I\u2019ve deduced myself. \n\n     My father (48) is not my biological father, my mother(45)  and he were not in a committed relationship when she got pregnant. My mother was upfront with not knowing who the father was when she initially got pregnant. He made it clear this did not bother him. He knew I (21) was not biologically his since I was about five or six. Both of my parents had very rough childhoods. My father grew up in the Philippines during a war and was the child of a mistress. After my maternal grandmother died, my mother began getting abused by her father. I say this because I want everyone to know the background of our family dynamic. \n\n     They got divorced when I was nine because my father didn\u2019t want to have more children while my mom was studying to become a professor. My dad made a good amount of money, as an established engineer. At this time my mother was a public school bus driver. My mom did not want my father to feel taken advantage of, so she never requested child support. She had primary custody, which is what they had both agreed to. Despite this, she still struggled to put food on the table. My mother scarcely asked my father for money, and he would rarely lend her money for necessities she could barely afford herself. \n\n     When I was in high school, like all teenagers I began to prioritize my friends over my family. I called my father less and less, enthralling myself with kids my age. After about a year of trying to adapt to my independence, he completely cut me out when I was a sophomore in high school. I was completely inconsolable for months, calling my father daily, and his friends to try to convince him to talk to me. After a while, I gave up completely. I went through all of high school, quarantine, and my graduation without my father. Still, one of his friends told me, my father wanted me to keep trying to reach out. \nI developed resentment towards my dad for this. Three years of reaching out, I felt as if I was supposed to perform for him. Like I was supposed to fight for my father, even harder than before. I completely checked out. This time last year, I decided to try one last time. It didn\u2019t take much effort for him to be excited to hear from me. His voice sounded sad but satisfied. He told me something about taking accountability for my actions, saying he felt discarded. I groveled an appropriate amount, and that seemed to satisfy him.\n\n      He soon asked me to come over for a few days, so that we could reconnect. The first thing he told me was that he hoped I was not a liberal. The first thing he told me was not that he missed me, or asked how my high school graduation was. He told me he hoped I was not a liberal. I knew at that moment, this reconciliation was not going to last. Even if I agreed with his political beliefs, this would be an alarming moment.  While we were separated, he converted to Catholicism and became rather obsessed with guns. While I was there, I observed that his guns were not secured. One sat in a bag on the living room floor where my three-year-old sister messed around often. I told him this worried me, and he insisted she \u201cknew better\u201d. Yeah right.\n\n      While we were separated I also realized I was transgender (FTM/NB) and I at least wanted to tell him that. When I subtly brought up transgender people he exploded into a spiel, obsessing over the genitals of athletes he assumed to be transgender. All I decided to tell him was that I was attracted to women. He shrugged this off, as long as I wasn\u2019t bisexual. He then exploded into another spiel on polyamorous people, insisting all bisexual people were cheaters. Something starkly different to how he treated his bisexual friend when we last spoke. It was like his eyes glazed over,  every time he saw an opportunity to discuss politics. I told him what real research said, and he would huff, insisting that he was right and that he didn\u2019t care what the science said. \n\n     The entire week I was there was exhausting, we only bonded over shallow things like television shows I recommended he should watch. Even my stepmother, who barely knew me, could tell I was holding something inside. The only good thing over the entire week was meeting my sister, who will likely never remember me. After I got home, I just deflated. It was like the understanding father I knew my whole life was warped into someone excited to hurt other people. He said very racist things about Chinese, Black, and Hispanic people while I was there, which was less surprising to me. After all, none of his Chinese, Black, or Hispanic friends were in his physical photo albums anymore. He also forgets my biological father is black, so I imagine he considers me \u201cone of the good ones\u201d.\n     \n     I tried to understand his politics over the phone multiple times, and the one time I corrected something false he said, he blew up at me. I hung up, he was someone who taught me not to tolerate the language he threw at me. He texted me, demanding I pick up, and said I had better not hang up on him again. I told him he was being cruel, and I hoped he understood that one day. He said he didn\u2019t need me in his life, and I\u2019d better apologize if I wanted to stay in his life. The very next day, he apologized and agreed he was cruel. I told him I was transgender over text, and told him I didn\u2019t need him if he was going to threaten to cut me off over every little thing.\n      \n     Sometimes I would send him music or show recommendations, and vice versa, but that was the extent of our relationship. After the 2024 election, I messaged him something of substance. I told him I hoped he would get what he wanted out of a trump presidency because I knew for a fact I wouldn\u2019t. I told him I hoped it would be worth our relationship. He insisted we could be close regardless of politics, and I taught him that. I don\u2019t see a relationship where we only discuss movies to be one of substance, nor to be one worth salvaging, so I did not respond. I blocked his number. I had to do so much emotional labor for him, and he didn\u2019t add anything to my life, since I was fourteen. I love him, but I have no reason to fight for him other than nostalgia. I believe nostalgia isn\u2019t worth all the ways he drained me.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I did not speak to my father again?\nLet me know if you want more details.\n(Edit: Grammar and formatting)",

      "selftext": "AITA?   One of our managers recently left to move back to her hometown. A coworker I was friends with asked me to create a going-away video for her. I initially declined because I work full-time and attend college full-time, but after some persistent begging, I reluctantly agreed. I tend to be a people-pleaser, so I gave in despite my busy schedule.  \n  \nI worked hard on the video, but my coworker kept sending me more pictures to include, even late into the night before the party. I stayed up until 11 p.m. finishing it, even though I had to wake up at 4 a.m. the next morning. The next day, I was excited about the video and, impulsively, (ADHD) showed it to the manager ahead of the planned time. My coworker and I had agreed to play it on the TV during lunch, but in my excitement, I broke our plan and showed it early.  \n  \nWhen my coworker found out, she was furious. She accused me of being untrustworthy, called me an attention-seeker, and claimed I \"stole the moment\" from everyone else. She said I made it all about myself. In my opinion, this reaction was unfair because she often shares everything she does\u2014charity work, events, etc.\u2014on social media, and I suspect she wanted to post the manager's reaction for herself.  \n  \nI sincerely apologized, but she dismissed it completely and has refused to acknowledge me since (Been over a month, won't speak to me in office etc.. ) I\u2019m in my early 30s, and she\u2019s in her mid-40s, so I find her response overly dramatic and unnecessary. I admit I made a mistake by showing the video early, and I do regret it. However, I don\u2019t think her anger is justified to this extent. If I hadn\u2019t made the video at all or failed to deliver it on time, I could understand her frustration. But I put in significant effort despite my tight schedule, and this entire situation has left me feeling hurt.  \n  \n",

      "selftext": "I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for about a year and my family (except dad, will elaborate) has been nice to him but I know they don\u2019t truly accept us being together because of his lower class, something that makes me so sad because he makes me so happy but they can\u2019t look past that. My dad: a few days ago marked the second time he ever spoke to my bf. Anytime my bf and him were in the same place he would completely ignore him to the point where he would turn his chair to face away from my bf. \n\nMy family is also very traditional and old school, they think premarital sex is super wrong and go to extreme lengths to prevent it. When I had my first bf at 15 I was never allowed to go to his house even when his mom would invite me, I wasn\u2019t allowed to be picked up by him, any time we wanted to go somewhere he would drive and my mom would drop me off and pick me up, in my house we were only allowed to be in public areas and they would check on us every few minutes. Even with all this, I still lost my virginity to him because we would always find ways. That experience made me never want to have a bf again, and I managed to wait until 19 to have my next bf. \n\nBy this time many other rules that my parents had set, I was already breaking, so I stopped caring and i do go in his car and to his house. I have never directly told my family that I go over to his house, but I\u2019m sure they can guess. My grandma also lives with us and she thinks the same, she has asked me in occasion if I go to his room or if we\u2019re ever home alone. Of course I go to his room and of course we\u2019re home alone but I get so nervous when it comes to those issues that I always deny. \nHis family is the opposite of mine, they all got married and had kids young, and they think that sex is just a part of life that\u2019s natural and normal. They don\u2019t care what me and my bf do and we mostly spend our time in bed watching movies. At my house, we can only be in public spaces and even then we wouldn\u2019t be able to cuddle while watching tv or show any pda. For all these reasons, I spend all my time at his place and am barely ever home. We probably spend at least 6 hours a day together, when he\u2019s off work we spend around 18 hours together. \n\nMy parents have never allowed me to sleepover anywhere, even now they allow me to go on weekend trips with my friends out of town, but still won\u2019t let me sleepover at their houses. This means I wake up, go over to my boyfriends house, and come home after midnight, sometimes until 2 am. This is something that has bothered my parents a lot, because they allow me to go out to the club until late but they don\u2019t think I should be with my bf until that late. Since I\u2019m not home all day I barely see my own family but when I do all they do is tell me that I\u2019m never home, that I never see them, that they\u2019re mad bc I was out too late, and today I\u2019m writing because my grandma woke up and I was already awake using the bathroom and wearing tennis shoes because I was going to feed the dogs, and she started confronting me that I had just gotten home. Although I\u2019ve been tempted, I would never sleepover at my bfs house because of the fear I have towards my family\u2019s judgment and anger. And then she tells me what she tells me often: \u201cdo you think it\u2019s right for you to spend all day and all night over there?\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with me spending all day with my bf, but I say that and she tells me that I am wrong. It\u2019s already uncomfortable for my bf to come to my house knowing how my parents really feel about him, but then these things happen and I wanna be home even less, and my bf wants to come over even less. \n\nSo I just wanna know, am I really wrong? This is who I want to spend the rest of my life with, if my parents weren\u2019t the way they were I would\u2019ve already moved out with him. It\u2019s funny because they don\u2019t think unmarried ppl should live together but I know if I were to say we\u2019re getting married they would never allow it until I\u2019m older. I just wonder because when we get married and live together, it\u2019s going to be normal for us to spend all our time together, so why is it wrong for us to spend all our time together now? I also wish they saw how it affects me when they tell me this stuff. It makes me really not want to be home at all, which is ironic bc they\u2019re getting mad that I\u2019m already not home but they\u2019re just pushing me away more. ",

      "selftext": "Just writing of the top of my head since I'm emotionally in turmoil for the last week or so. English is not my native language so excuse any errors. I just need to clear my head.\n\nShort background, my girlfriend and I broke up 6 months ago. We ended things after a long period of not being happy together due to mostly personal stuff on both our ends. We still love and loved each other, but at the time we were too toxic together. We have worked on ourselves in the last months. \nWe recently decided to work on us and get back together by going to therapy, both individually and as a couple motivated by the fact that we rather want to actively work on our relationship and see if we really can have a life together, rather than running from our problems and possibly regret it for the rest of our life. We genuinely both want it to work. \n\nRight before she ended it, she slept with man X and she has slept with man X up until a month ago. Man X is married and have a children and a wife. I don't really blame her for it as it was a very turbulent time and most of what happend between them happened when we were single. It does hurt a lot, as the thought of her being with another man provokes negative feelings in me, but the prospect of us outshines that negative and I am planning to forgive it. I am a proud man however and find it difficult to accept, but I believe I will.\nShe acknowledges that she met him before we ended things and does not deny anything. She is also willing to do everything to regain my trust.\n\nSo, to the real AITAH question. \n\nI spoke with man X and gave him a chance to come clean to me, for my own process of healing. I informed him that if he lied to me, I would go to his wife with whatever consequences there may be if I do so. He accepted the terms and choose the easy way out with lies and downplaying. \nI am now planning to send proof of his infidelity to his wife and honestly, hopefully hurt him in the process. I think she deserves to know. Objectively, I believe he is the biggest A*#$@ considering he has a wife and a child. \nAITAH?\n\nI have to add, I am not perfect. I am vindictive and a maybe part of me does this to hurt my girlfriend, but I truly believe I need to \"get back at him\" for sleeping with my GF while we were together to get over this and focus on the imporant thing, us. It takes two to tango, I know, but at least she is owning up to it and wants to make amends and THAT I appreciate.\n\n",

      "selftext": "\nContext: I\u2019m (F) 15 she is (F) 15, we have been together for 3 months now. I know it is not a long time and it is a highschool relationship. When we first got together everything was so sweet and we I felt were both just really happy. She told when we first got together she had liked me almost a year before we actually got together. I thought we were doing great up until about a month and a half in. I was feeling very down and felt there was a problem with something in our relationship. So being a highschool year old girl I brought the topic up to her the best I could without making it an argument. It seemed she took it well and we carried on going back to being normal then a week or so later it happened again. Then this started becoming a more frequent pattern. I would feel upset in our relationship and try to fix it by talking to her she would say she would fix it and she would for very short amount of time then go back to treating me the same way if not worse. \n(Back to present) I had been talking to my friends and asking for advice they all tell me if it doesn\u2019t get better I should break up with her. But I feel like I really love her and I thought we had a deep connection. She was my first kiss and first gay relationship. I really love her so much that\u2019s why it makes me so upset that this is happening and I\u2019m questioning our relationship. I have talked to her so many time and i feel like it just keeps getting worse. She lately has been super busy and distant. Like I understand busy but not this kind of busy. Like I\u2019ll ask her if we can talk for like 10-15 minutes just because I miss her and she\u2019ll say she\u2019s busy, drawing or playing VR. Which is fine so I\u2019ll text her after a hour and ask her if she\u2019s busy and it\u2019ll take her so long to reply. I ask her when we can hangout she tells me this weekend when the weekend rolls around it doesn\u2019t happen. She says she has plans with family but then when I ask her about them she says that the plans got canceled. And I would understand if this was like a one or two time thing but not all the time. Every-time we do talk it seems she\u2019s uninterested in what I\u2019m saying or completely ignores me at times. For example just today I was on ft with her and I was trying to talk to her all the response I got was that\u2019s not cutesy. I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m being unreasonable and should just understand that we aren\u2019t going to talk all the time or if this relationship is toxic. Am I the asshole? \n(Edit) I have really bad attachment issues and I really think I love her so it\u2019s really hard for me to break up with someone. Plus she also has her own personal issues that she\u2019s dealing with. But when I ask her to tell me about them she doesn\u2019t want to which is fine but I feel like those problems are driving a wedge in between our relationship. \n\n\n",

      "selftext": "I made friends with a guy a year and a half ago, mainly because I knew we liked similar things (we both played an instrument, liked tarot and metal). After two weeks of being friends, he told me he was in love with me. I explained to him as nicely as I could that, after two weeks of knowing each other, he couldn't possibly be in love with me, and that, on top of this, I had been SA'd by my then boyfriend a few months prior, on top of psychological abuse, so dating or catching feelings wasn't in my to do list at all. After that, our relationship took a u turn. He tried to use me as his therapist, tried to guilt trip me, telling me that I broke his heart so hard that he tried to commit suicide, he told me that I was so traumatized that he involuntarily \"stole\" a part of my trauma and was traumatized. He also kept telling me about the psychiatrist and the therapist that he was seeing, saying that it wasn't enough to handle his sorrow, when he knew that I wasn't receiving any help about the trauma of the rape I survived not long ago, and that I had tried to end my life as well. It became too hard, and my best friend encouraged me to block him everywhere. That's what I did, but then he stalked me for three months and wrote me a 13 pages long letter about his feelings and how I broke his heart. I was finally able to get rid of him irl, and then we both changed cities, so I was finally free from his words. Now I understand that everybody copes differently, and that we all have our own sensitivity, but I couldn't handle him rubbing in my face all the help he was getting for a heartbreak while I was struggling to even be allowed to change my classes so that I wouldn't have to stay in the same room as my rapist the whole day. \nThe madness stopped 7 months ago, and now I've been living my life a bit more normally. \nThe real issue happened tonight. this morning, I woke up, and noticed some texts from him on insta. He had called me twice, and was begging me to reply, even if I just said a random word, telling me how unwell he was feeling. I know from a mutual friend that he has become an alcoholic since he changed cities, and I was afraid that he might have done something stupid or killed himself during the night. When I saw the texts, I immediately panicked, tried to call him and text him, but no reply. Our mutual friend also did, as I told her I was worried, but he didn't reply to her either. \nAfter 10 long hours of panicking and thinking that someone died because of me, he texted back, as though nothing had happened. He asked me how I was doing, if I liked my new college, told me that he was having fun in his, and that he was drinking a lot (he really insisted a lot on the fact that he drinks almost everyday), and I'm absolutely mad. This man just made me think that I was the worth person on earth, and that, just because I had rejected someone and that I was sleeping, someone had killed themselves, and now he was acting like it was all good? \nI really want to block him, and my best friend encouraged me to do so, but I'm afraid that it might make things worse. What if he gets drunk again? What if he kills himself for good? What if he puts the blame on me, and a cop investigation has to be done on me because of his words? Would I truly be the one to blame?
