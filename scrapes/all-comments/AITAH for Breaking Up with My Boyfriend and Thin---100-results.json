As you will need prove he did not get permission to use your cards.</p>\n\n<p>So i have some questions he transferred money from your savings so to do that he needed to use your atm card and have your pin or someone from the bank would need to allow it the credit cards would potentially be easier to use as he could just steal them from your purse and either add them to his phone or accounts online. So if he went to the bank and the bank just handed him money from your account without his name on the account that is illegal and the bank will fine the teller and fire them for violating bank security and exchange law. Unfortunately fdic insuramce does not offer enough protection to get all your momey back but some would. </p>\n\n<p>The consequences for him will be arrest fines fraud charges and garnishment.</p>\n\n<p>But my question was was he a named user on your account? Was he an authorized user on your cards? 50k is not a small claim amount that is grand theft. Either this happened in a very short amount of time you failed to notice yourself being bled like a side of meat at the butchers. Or you dont watch your finances as close as you should.</p>\n</div>",

If his name is on the accounts or cards there isn't much you can do.  if you are in the US then you can sue for anything, but it will cost you.  if he logged into your account and took the money without being on the account and authorization. then its illegal and you need to file a police report and talk to your bank to see if there are ways to claim back.  your insurance might be able to help as well, but you need to check your policy.  just so you know, 50k theft is a felony in the US and if he used the internet to move money he can be hit with cyber crimes as well.  He's looking at a lot of jail time and a felony record.\n\nAs for suing, that will still cost you money, and if he is truly broke you might not be able to get anything back.  even garnishing his wages wouldn't help.  And depending on where you live, the DA might not even bother for such a low amount.  but you could take some of those shinny new toys he bought, the sheriff can help with that.",
