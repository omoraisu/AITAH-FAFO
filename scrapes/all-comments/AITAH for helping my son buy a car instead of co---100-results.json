      "selftext": "This is my first time posting so forgive me if I\u2019m missing anything. I (52M) got remarried 6 years ago to my wife (44f). I have a son (19M) from my previous marriage and a stepdaughter (13f) from my wife\u2019s previous marriage. I got an unexpected bonus from my job recently and I decided to use it to help my son buy a car.\n\nMy son is going to the local community college but his boyfriend went to a university about an hour and a half away. He\u2019s been pretty bummed about his boyfriend being gone. I thought it\u2019d be nice if he could get a car so he could drive up there whenever he wants to. Also that way he could always drive himself to school and work. He has a job but hadn\u2019t saved enough for a car, so I matched what he had and he bought a decent used car.\n\nUpon finding this out, my wife was upset at me for using my bonus on something \u201ccompletely unnecessary.\u201d She wanted me to add my bonus to my stepdaughter\u2019s college fund. Of course I care about setting my stepdaughter up for success but she\u2019s 5 years away from college and my son is currently in it. I didn\u2019t expect it to be a big deal. She told her sister who\u2019s been ripping me a new one over this. My son has been so hardworking this semester and I just wanted to help out. I probably should\u2019ve discussed it with my wife first but she seems upset about how I spent it, not about me not communicating my plan beforehand. AITA? ",
