      "selftext": "I (26 female) have been living in the US. I met my friend, Tonya (fake name), a couple years back. Tonya lived with my then current worker (let's call her Molly) who I was becoming friends with. Us three would hang out fairly regularly, like 2-4 times a month. I would go to their house and we would also go hang out at a park regularly. Tonya was in college and Molly and I were not in college. Eventually Tonya graduated and moved back to her home town area to work for her parents and be closer to her long time boyfriend, who was in school near the area. For the entire time I knew Tonya, she had this boyfriend. Never complained about him, he seemed like a good one based off of what she was telling me. They were long distance so she was excited to be back closer with him. Once she moved back (May 2023) we barely talked. Occasional Instagram reels back and forth. Our friend Molly had a baby, so Tonya came back and visited sometime this year. When she had visited Molly and the baby, I knew she had just gotten engaged a month or two prior but she never singularly told me, I found out through Molly. When I saw her, it was nice to see her and I congratulated her on the long time coming engagement. She was stoked and then asked me to be a bridesmaid. I said yes right off the back cause I was asked in person. Of course I would love to support my friend on her big day. But here's the catch, I've been saving up money and time to go on my solo backpacking travels to New Zealand, Australia, se Asia. I've been wanting to go for years and it finally feels right to go in 2025. I plan on heading out right after my dad's 60th bday in early February. When I finally decided to do this trip, in my head it's about 6 months, or even more. I truly wanna explore and experience these parts of the world. I'm a free soul and I truly wanna just let life flow and travel with my own plans and no specific dates that hold me back. I am single, don't own a house or assets, don't have pets. I don't have anything holding me back to a place or time frame of responsibility..... besides Tonya's wedding. She decided on a date, sometime in June. If I leave mid February , I would only get 4ish months of uninterrupted travel time. That seems like plenty, and maybe it is, but what if it isn't.... what if I'm having the time of my life and finding what I've been longing for? Obviously I won't know until I am traveling and out there. But now I'm thinking I should tell Tonya to take me off the bridal party and I'll try my hardest to make the wedding if I can. If I'm back from travels, I'd love to be apart of her wedding. But I don't want her planning her bridal party with me in it. It's too much guilt and what ifs. I'm not sure what to do. We are friends for sure, but she isn't my closest friend by any means. I feel as if I am not in bridal party, she may only have one other brides maid. I don't know that for sure, but I sympathize with her and her bridal dreams. But I also have to live my life. AITAH?",
