      "selftext": "So I (25M) recently had a few friends over for dinner. I love to cook, and I made a pretty elaborate meal, thinking everyone would enjoy it. One of my friends, Sarah (30F), has been a little critical of my cooking in the past, but I\u2019ve always brushed it off because she\u2019s known for being very blunt about her opinions.\n\nWell, last night she took it a step further. During dinner, she kept making little jabs at the food, saying things like, \u201cThis isn\u2019t quite how I would\u2019ve made it,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a little dry,\u201d and \u201cI would\u2019ve added more spices.\u201d She said it repeatedly and in a way that made everyone else uncomfortable. After about the fourth comment, I told her to stop, but she kept going, trying to correct my cooking methods. I\u2019m no professional chef, but I was proud of the meal, and it felt like she was disrespecting my effort.\n\nAt that point, I asked her to leave because I wasn\u2019t going to sit there and listen to constant criticism. She was shocked and said I overreacted, but I told her that if she wasn\u2019t going to be supportive, she could eat somewhere else. She left in a huff, and now some of our other friends are texting me saying I should\u2019ve just let it slide and that I was being overly sensitive.\n\nSo, AITA for asking my friend to leave my house because she kept criticizing my cooking?",
