      "selftext": "I 40f have a son who is 17 m. We lost his dad when I was 28. It was hard for us..we didn't have time to build massive fortune. But from his insurance and other investments, i created a trust fund for my son and the money there is around 150k usd.  I have done good career wise and is employed at government job. Which is secure job till 60 and pays decently to live upper middle class life style . \n\nI met my current husband when I was 30 ( he was 32 )  during some event. We connected from day one and a year later we got married. My husband has twins aged 15 m and 15 f.  Their mother is involved in their life and my husband made clear from day one that children finances will be kept seperate. We share grocery , necessities and clothes etc fund. But savings and school fees are kept seperately. We also own our homes separately. And I am currently living at his house and renting my own.note that rent is exclusively used for whole family travels etc.  My son and his children get along fine. But they don't call us parents or each other siblings. We also have a daughter together who is 7. Also I save lot for young daughter as she won't have this trust fund and I want to secure her future.\n\n\nRecent issue has been that my son has that fund and he wants to study in australia and is preparing for his move next year. My husband children has their fund. But max he can contribute to each children's fund is 25k . He lost money on gambling and his ex wife doesn't save \n\nHe says let's join all funds and is pressuring my son. He was giving in. I refused. I said it was my son's inheritance from his dad and that can't cover the loss of father. My husband exploded and abused verbally in anger..I also didn't hold back. He slapped me. First time ever in life he hit me\n\nWe sorted out things later but I am not going to give this fund..my step children who have always been cordial to me are suddenly calling me evil monster. Same children for those who I prepare meals every morning at 6 am. Wash their clothes. Iron them. And buy them clothes and other things despite my husband barely doing it for my son. If combined. The fund will come out 83 k each.  Though it will still cover aus education for all of three.. I am not going to do that.  His children Also want to go Australia now.\n\nMy son said he doesn't want my marriage to fall and said he will give away the amount if it makes me happy. I said no and said his future can't be compromised.\n\nI told my husband that it isn't my fault that he was careless..in 9 years marriage. He never acted like this and he is giving cold treatment since.\n\nMy marriage is on verge of breaking but I can't deny my son his rights. I know if I say yes. He will happily share\n But I won't..I rather burn. But I am crying the way my man is treating me. My parents are saying you won't find a man later and to compromise and make peace. They said fight was one time happening. And we are expected to adjust. Also I want to give him chance if he stops poking my son. \n\nMy frnds are saying it is tough to find a man again when you are a widow and then divorcee \n\nEdit \n.also to add he started drinking more now and demands sex which i refuse. It is leading to fights..And I let him do it  many times.\nthough I hate it doing with his drunk self \n\nAlso he slapped me in private. My children don't know about it nor my parents. They know we fought.\n\nAitah for refusing to share? ",

        "body": "NTA. My friend, prepare to leave. \n\nLet's break this down, including your edits:\n\n1. Your husband has gone from respecting financial boundaries between your children to exploding violently when you enforce those boundaries.\n\n2. He is attempting to pressure/manipulate your 17 year old son, who likely really wants the approval of the only father he remembers.\n\n3. He is OK with his own children emotionally abusing you, likely encouraging it. \n\n4. He hit you for the first time. That's where it starts. \n\n5. He is a former(?) gambler. His behavior may point that he is doing it again in secret. \n\n6. He is drinking and pressuring you to have sex. \n\n7. You are having sex with him when you don't want to in order to avoid an argument. That is a form of assault. \n\nAll of that does not add up to a happy marriage or a good environment for you or your children. \n\nLook, if one of your friends came to you with this story, what would your advice be? \n\nI'm a 47F, I understand how hard it is to connect with someone as a woman over 40. But you are not doing yourself or your kids any favors. In fact, you are damaging them. They are watching their mother being mistreated and learning it is ok. Don't teach them that lesson. \n\nYou will not be alone. Tell your parents the full truth. Tell them about the slap. I am also curious about whether your husband is gambling again without your knowledge. He is acting like an addict sliding back into use and freaking out over the money he is losing. \n\nCall a lawyer. Prepare to leave and do it right. You have a job, property and rental income. You are in a good position to restart. Do it now, before the next slap comes.",

It would be one thing if he was hounding you about finances - which is bad enough - but he got physical. It's not a giant leap to think of him doing that to your son. He is pressuring you in sex after you say no. That's rape. \n\nYour husband is a gambling addict with a drinking problem. Being an addict doesn't make you a bad person. Being abusive does, and it takes a real coward to manipulate his kids and get violent with his wife to get what he wants.\n\nYou need to get out of the house, get a lawyer, get counseling, and review the credit reports of yourself, kids. The odds are if he's desperate for money he's not above taking loans in other people's name. You may want to alert his ex as well so she monitor her kids' credit.

He hit me too, so I should not have been surprised he hit my mom. But compassionate moms who take the brunt don&#39;t get the credit they&#39;re deserved. Just please, do not, to the BEST of your ability allow his behavior to continue for yourself. It spillls over on everyone. It is not your fault. He has issues that need to be addressed, but not by you.</p>\n\n<p>Your job right now is to silently save funds to gtfo asap. Document, record,take pictures, notate everything. Talk to a lawyer discreetly and get your 2 kids out of there.</p>\n\n<p>Best of luck OP. Keep your chin up. If you need help finding resources, feel free to DM me. I&#39;ll do everything I can.</p>\n</div>",

It's not just the slap.\u00a0\n\n\nSo many red flags!\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a01) He met and married you in all in one year's time. After his own failed marriage, perhaps he did this to have a woman take care of the daily needs of his kids, depending on the custody agreement. Did he have full or half custody? Did he take care of his own kids, or was is all you?\n\n\n2) He gambled away his own children's savings account. It is not your job or responsibility to fix his failure.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a03) He didn't want to mix up the kids funds until he found out that your child has more than his.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a04) He sounds like he is trying to find solutions down at the bottom of a bottle of alcohol. Does he drink to excess often?

I don't care where you live or what language you speak. If he was a good man he would have *never asked* or at least respected your no and dropped it. And you are absolutely blind to what this is doing to your kids. So I'm going to tell you: they are not ok. No matter what they say. You don't seem to be considering that. You need to. The choice you make will be paid for through their life experiences. \n\nUnsatisfied Mother: I'm not going to talk about you and your husband, or tell you what you should do. You are a grown woman. \n\nYou want to be slapped and verbally abused for money you BOTH decided wouldn't be split? *Fine*. You're ok with him.berating your son and convincing your step kids to join in? *Great*. Your worried about your prosepects if you become a widowed divorcee? *Got it.*  \n\nBut you know what? This situation you find yourself in is not *just about you*. You have children. You have a boy about to launch who is worried sick about you (enough to consider giving away part of whats his)  and a seven year old watching your every move, every choice. Are they factoring into your decision making?\n\nI am a foster parent. My husband and I take care of kids from 0 -18, we have loved and housed 31 as of yesterday. We've learned these kids come from every type of home, so we don't judge. But what I can tell you is that you can trace most of their life trajectories back to a single bad choice someone made blindly.\n\nSo I hope you'll forgive my bluntness, but I just came off a hard 3 weeks with a beautiful ten year old girl, who's life is ruined, and your post here is just a bit too familiar on the wrong damn day for me. I am going to open your eyes so you can't claim blindness ten years from now. I'm going to tell you what someone should have told her mother three years ago. Downvote me to hell. Then you can do what you wish. \n\n Despite what your son has said, I can tell you without doubt: He NEEDS you to choose him. No matter how old he is. If you don't, he will live of course --- but it creates a crack. \n\nAs he ages, and thinks, and gains insight -- that crack, will grow. He will love you, but he will wonder why he had to consider a sacrifice for you. Why his Father's money was the ransom to save a marriage to man he could never call Dad, though he'd lived with him longer than his own. Why kids who weren't even of his Dad's blood could even consider taking what little was left of his efforts on earth. Why he had to be the adult for you.\n\n And ultimately he will swallow his feelings because he (wrongly) thinks he's the oldest, you are his true family, and your happiness is his responsibility. Why? Because he is getting out of that house and never coming back anyway. You say hes been a good husband--I wonder if your son would agree. He loves you enough to sacrifice for your peace, but you just stick around. Let your family treat you and him like shit. If you stay he will always wonder why you couldn't just choose him. \n\nThen your wee daughter. It will be worse for her, unlike your son she's only coming to consciousness. This period of her life is forming her memories.\n\nSo, she will see your husband treat you like shit. She'll see a man that drinks too much and is a bully, and lets his kids be bullies too. Do they treat her well, and only berate your son? Or is it equal opportunity warfare? She will never tell you, because her world orbits around your happiness. She won't want to be another problem for Mummy.\n\nThough she can't articulate it, she feels insecure. People are leaving, people are mad, people are sad. She's been watching and she belives (wrongly)  she can fix everything by being a distractor.  She will clamour for attention -- good or bad -- doing whatever she has to do to deflect everyone away from hurting you, and being mad. Maybe she can be a perfect girl, or make Daddy laugh or let her siblings be mean to her because they think it's fun? She'll find a way to make everyone happy because that's what little kids can do in their limited power. And that will create a deep crack in her, and your relationship too.\n\nIf you are unfortunate, she will grow up believing what happens in her house is what love is, because you, the woman she loves the most, showed her that. She will accept what she thinks is love in all the wrong ways, from all the wrong people. It won't take much. Or, she will learn to sacrifice herself to keep the peace, or continue to mask her feelings through attention seeking or destructive behaviours. What I can say is no child comes from an unhappy home unscathed. They usually pay for it with their self worth.\n\nOr, maybe all that will happen is she will age, think, gain insight and wonder why *you* didn't choose yourself, and in turn, her? You had a safe place to go, a good job: Why you let her grow up like that? Why did you stay? And she will love you, but there will be an anger -- a  destructive rage only girls can experience with their Mothers. She will either weaponize that against you or herself. Some lucky girls can channel that rage into some kind of success, appearing fully functional and well formed on the outside: but they are all full of cracks.\n\nNow I know that everyone has some kind of crack, and you'll probably write this off as being dramatic. And I know I'm being harsh when you were just looking for empathy and understanding. But I'm tired of piecing together little bits of broken hearts. You have means, which means you have advantages. You are better off than most women --you have choices.\n\nBelieve me or not, should you split that money, or stay with no resolution, some variation of these outcomes will be true.Your tale is not unique. Now that you know the possible outcomes, make your choice with clear eyes. You do you. \n\nAnd we'll continue to do what we do, because though there are always variations, this cycle never fucking ends.",

People who tell you: \u201cyou will never find a man again\u201d have no empathy for you and may not help you when you need it most in the future. I understand your parents\u2019 point, they helped you, but they won\u2019t always be there since they are older people, but that\u2019s the lousiest advice they can give you. You are a woman and a mom, you were able to get ahead. If you are a confident woman, the right person will come along for you. Just don\u2019t focus on forcing yourself into a relationship.\n\nBelieve me there are men who marry women who have 2, 3 or 4 children and are very happy. If it is in your destiny it will come, your same energy will attract a good person, but if you continue with the fear of being alone, you will only get an abusive man and you don\u2019t deserve that. I am so sorry you are going through this. Big hugs. I hope you read this, but if your husband already hit you once, he will do it again. He is showing you how he really is, if in his past he liked to gamble and was not responsible to save for his children\u2019s future, what makes you think he will do it now. He was fortunate enough to meet you and maybe he changed his ways in some ways, but I think he has reached his limit and is showing his true personality.\n\nThe worst part of this is that he is manipulating you into giving in and not just to you, but to your child as well. I am worried that you will decide to stay with him in the future and refuse anything else he asks for and he will hit you again. I wouldn\u2019t feel bad if your son gave in to share his inheritance if only your husband had given 100% to your son buying him gifts without your consent, spending quality time with him, being like a real father and father figure, but he never made that effort with your son. Even if you didn\u2019t ask your husband, he never showed any love or affection towards your son, but you did have some appreciation for your stepchildren, you bought them things even though you agreed on the expenses separately, you yourself mentioned that your husband hardly ever does those things with your son. What you can do is to be firm that your son does not share his inheritance, your marriage is broken, talk to your husband and force him to go to marriage and individual therapy.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t change, my dear get out of that marriage, don\u2019t be afraid to be alone, the good man will come, as long as you are a stable person. For now focus on you and your children, please forget about that idea that no man will want to be with you, they only do it to make you stay in a place where you will not be happy. \n\nI wish you the best and hope you are well, please update us so we know you are",

                "body": "u/UnsatisfiedMother15 My dear, don\u2019t be afraid to be alone, repeat this every time you have difficult situations. People who tell you: \u201cyou will never find a man again\u201d have no empathy for you and may not help you when you need it most in the future. I understand your parents\u2019 point, they helped you, but they won\u2019t always be there since they are older people, but that\u2019s the lousiest advice they can give you. You are a woman and a mom, you were able to get ahead. If you are a confident woman, the right person will come along for you. Just don\u2019t focus on forcing yourself into a relationship.\n\nBelieve me there are men who marry women who have 2, 3 or 4 children and are very happy. If it is in your destiny it will come, your same energy will attract a good person, but if you continue with the fear of being alone, you will only get an abusive man and you don\u2019t deserve that. I am so sorry you are going through this. Big hugs. I hope you read this, but if your husband already hit you once, he will do it again. He is showing you how he really is, if in his past he liked to gamble and was not responsible to save for his children\u2019s future, what makes you think he will do it now. He was fortunate enough to meet you and maybe he changed his ways in some ways, but I think he has reached his limit and is showing his true personality.\n\nThe worst part of this is that he is manipulating you into giving in and not just to you, but to your child as well. I am worried that you will decide to stay with him in the future and refuse anything else he asks for and he will hit you again. I wouldn\u2019t feel bad if your son gave in to share his inheritance if only your husband had given 100% to your son buying him gifts without your consent, spending quality time with him, being like a real father and father figure, but he never made that effort with your son. Even if you didn\u2019t ask your husband, he never showed any love or affection towards your son, but you did have some appreciation for your stepchildren, you bought them things even though you agreed on the expenses separately, you yourself mentioned that your husband hardly ever does those things with your son. What you can do is to be firm that your son does not share his inheritance, your marriage is broken, talk to your husband and force him to go to marriage and individual therapy.\n\nIf he doesn\u2019t change, my dear get out of that marriage, don\u2019t be afraid to be alone, the good man will come, as long as you are a stable person. For now focus on you and your children, please forget about that idea that no man will want to be with you, they only do it to make you stay in a place where you will not be happy.\n\nI wish you the best and hope you are well, please update us so we know you are",
                "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"/u/UnsatisfiedMother15\">u/UnsatisfiedMother15</a> My dear, don\u2019t be afraid to be alone, repeat this every time you have difficult situations. People who tell you: \u201cyou will never find a man again\u201d have no empathy for you and may not help you when you need it most in the future. I understand your parents\u2019 point, they helped you, but they won\u2019t always be there since they are older people, but that\u2019s the lousiest advice they can give you. You are a woman and a mom, you were able to get ahead. If you are a confident woman, the right person will come along for you. Just don\u2019t focus on forcing yourself into a relationship.</p>\n\n<p>Believe me there are men who marry women who have 2, 3 or 4 children and are very happy. If it is in your destiny it will come, your same energy will attract a good person, but if you continue with the fear of being alone, you will only get an abusive man and you don\u2019t deserve that. I am so sorry you are going through this. Big hugs. I hope you read this, but if your husband already hit you once, he will do it again. He is showing you how he really is, if in his past he liked to gamble and was not responsible to save for his children\u2019s future, what makes you think he will do it now. He was fortunate enough to meet you and maybe he changed his ways in some ways, but I think he has reached his limit and is showing his true personality.</p>\n\n<p>The worst part of this is that he is manipulating you into giving in and not just to you, but to your child as well. I am worried that you will decide to stay with him in the future and refuse anything else he asks for and he will hit you again. I wouldn\u2019t feel bad if your son gave in to share his inheritance if only your husband had given 100% to your son buying him gifts without your consent, spending quality time with him, being like a real father and father figure, but he never made that effort with your son.
