      "selftext": "Hi, John. M47. Throwaway account since my oldest daughter and my wife know my main. So my wife Anna (fake name) F35 and I have been married for 12 years, and we have three kids aged F11, M10, and M8. Recently, I decided to surprise her by redecorating our living room while she was away on a business trip. I spent a lot of time and money picking out new furniture, painting the walls, and even getting some custom artwork. When she came back, instead of being happy, she was furious. She said I completely ignored her taste and made the room look like a bachelor pad. I thought I was doing something nice, but now she's making me feel like I ruined everything.\n\nHere's the kicker: whenever I've gone on business trips in the past, I've come home to find that she's redecorated or repainted parts of the house. I work in finance, and she's an interior decorator, so I get that she has a professional eye for this stuff. But come on, she married me, so she must think I have good taste too, right? My parents are on my side, saying that I should have some control over what our house looks like. Honestly, I think she's overreacting.\n\nI might be the asshole because I redecorated our living room without consulting Anna, but I also think that I should be able to have a say in what my own home looks like.\n\nMy oldest daughter told me not to post about this since I tend to Reddit often, but I need to prove to my wife that I'm right. She obviously doesn't trust my judgment apparently. Maybe marriage counseling? She's mentioned it before, it could be a good idea I guess.\n\nAITA for trying to surprise my wife with a redecorated living room? ",
