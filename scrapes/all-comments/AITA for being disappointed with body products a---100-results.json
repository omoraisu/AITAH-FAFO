      "selftext": "I\u2019ve read a few posts about girls receiving body washes and soaps and loving them, but I don\u2019t feel like that. I received my first body wash set at 16 and basically gave it back because I said I wasn\u2019t going to use it, my cousin ended up using it. I\u2019ve never like the scents they use, and besides that I already suffered with body acne and sensitive skin. Fast forward to last year, my 21st, I had sent out a list of things I liked and shared it with my family, they were all reasonably priced. I only did this because I\u2019ve had a history of people gifting me things and actually giving them away because it\u2019s not anywhere close to what I like or use. But when I opened them, I had at least 7-10 body wash sets. I was beyond disappointed, because it was why I sent the list. But my mum said I should be grateful, and I was, it\u2019s the thought that counts right. But I was also sad, they spend their money on me and I just give it away. It also makes me feel like no one knows anything about me. Like there are so many things I talk about that interest me. And a year later I receive another body wash set, and all the feelings flood in. Don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m grateful for the thought, but now I just feel like they\u2019ve wasted their hard earned money. I\u2019m okay with even just a birthday card. That\u2019s how simple I am. My hygiene routine is also quite set and I don\u2019t chop and change things. Am I the asshole for being disappointed and complaining about getting bath sets as a gift?\n\n\nThank you everyone for the advice <3",
