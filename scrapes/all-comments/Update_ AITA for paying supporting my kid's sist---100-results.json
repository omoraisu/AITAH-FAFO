      "selftext": "**Original Post** \n\nThrowaway because my girlfriend knows my main. I (44M) have two kids (18M & 16M) from a previous relationship. My ex has another kid (14F). My sons have always been very loving and dotting big brothers to their sister. Their sister's dad died when she was 4. I am not her dad, but I felt for her. I grew up as the only kid of my parent's union with half siblings and I was treated like an outsider. So, when he died, I stepped into a sort of \"uncle\" role for her. All three kids go to a rather expensive private school. I pay the tuition for all three.\n\nI have been dating my GF (37F) for 3 years. He has lived with me for the last year. She works at the school and has two kids there (13F & 10M). The pay is terrible, but a perk is that she gets a pretty steep tuition discount (as do all employees). Her ex pays the remainder tuition, plus child support, for their kids.\n\nWell, her ex's business imploded awhile back and he had a significant decrease in his income. They went to court and the court decreased his child support significantly. He also is no longer paying the remainder. This means my GF needs to make it up or kids go to public school. That isn't really possible for her.\n\nShe asked me to help, I refuse. I have a strict budget I keep to every month. If this was a true emergency, I would help, but it isn't. She then said I could simply switch the money I pay for \"my ex's daughter\" to her kids and that would allow me to pay. I refuse to do that. She is staying with her parents and hasn't talked to me in a week.\n\nAITA?\n\n**Update**\n\nWell, one of the comments on the original post really struck a nerve with me. It talked about how my GF's insistence that my kids' sister go to public school, but her kids cannot, really revealed her character. We have had some follow-up discussions. Basically, she insisted that my kids' sister isn't **my** family, so if anyone is going to benefit from my money it should be my kids or potential stepkids. I told her that I think she is being harsh to a child, and that she can be so cavalier about a child who has only one parent makes me want to break up. So, I made the decision to break up. She is moving out in a month. Likely, her kids will have to go public school in a different district because the few apartments in our district are way too expensive for her. She is pissed and asked me to resconsider multiple times. I think this is for the best. She asked if she could use my address so they could go to the local public school next semester. My understanding is that can potentially be considered fraud and land me in legal trouble, so I said \"no.\" She says not only am I forcing her kids to change schools mid school year, they will have to go to a school where they do not know any kids. They at least are friends with kids in the local public schools. ",

Big red flag. If that\u2019s the route she\u2019s willing to go, it\u2019s probably for the best that you two are breaking up. If she can\u2019t see that helping all the kids is important, then it\u2019s probably time to move on. You\u2019re not obligated to take on the financial burden of her kids, especially when she has her own resources, and she&#39;s putting her needs ahead of a child who\u2019s already had a tough life. </p>\n\n<p>Good for you for sticking to your boundaries!</p>\n</div>",

You\u2019ve been supporting your ex\u2019s daughter for years, stepping in as a father figure, and she\u2019s trying to make you choose between that and her kids. It\u2019s a tough call, but it sounds like she\u2019s not really respecting the bond you have with your kids&#39; sister. You can\u2019t just be expected to move money around like that, especially when it\u2019s a financial situation that she could work out herself. Breaking up was probably the best move if she\u2019s not understanding the bigger picture.</p>\n</div>",
