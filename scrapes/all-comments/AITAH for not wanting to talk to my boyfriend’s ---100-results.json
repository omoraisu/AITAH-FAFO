      "selftext": "My (30F) boyfriend (36M) has a close group of guy friends he graduated with that he considers brothers. After graduating, most of them moved out of state, but they still keep in touch pretty often through their group chat. They don't see each other often aside from weddings, birthdays, etc. \n\nHis friend's birthday was this past weekend so everyone came down to go out and celebrate. On the first night, they decided to meet up at a bar we  frequent. I didn't plan on going out with them because I wanted him to have time with just his boys since he doesn't see them often, but he insisted and I thought it was sweet of him so I did. We drank, played darts, and were having a good time when his friend we'll call D (35M) shows up. Right away, he calls my boyfriend over to the bar to speak to him privately, which I thought was odd at first but I didn't think too much of it. D stays for maybe 30 more minutes then tells us he is leaving. Again, it strikes me as weird because he was the last to arrive but first to leave. My boyfriend offered to buy him another beer to get him to stay, but he says he has a long drive and heads out.\n\nAt the end of the night when we leave, my bf tells me that D left to go hook up with this girl two cities away. When D called him over to the bar, he was showing my boyfriend he was exchanging with the girl (I guess showing off in some weird, sick way?) Apparently he was using his time down here as an opportunity to step out while his wife was at home with their child. My bf was trying to talk him out of going saying he was stupid and that he was lucky he was forgiven before, but now that she is pregnant with their second child, he probably won't be given that same grace.\n\nI was extremely upset because I adore his wife and so does the rest of the group. She is practically family. She is so sweet and she has already forgiven him for inappropriately texting other women for the sake of their child. My bf doesn't agree with what he's doing, but none of them want to get involved or interfere with their marriage. I refused to go out again the rest of the weekend if he were there and I also told my bf I refuse to speak to him because I have nothing to say to him nor do I \nwant anything to do with him moving forward. My boyfriend understands, but I feel like I put him in a weird spot. He went out with them two more times, and they have asked about me and where I was. I won't lie, I can't help but feel a little bad. Am I handling this appropriately, or am I being an AH? ",
