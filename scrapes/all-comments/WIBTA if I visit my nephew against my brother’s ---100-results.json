      "selftext": "My brother got divorced 10 years ago and practically abandoned his kid and ex-wife (he cheated on his ex and now lives with his new gf). His ex wife and nephew live overseas. My brother has never visited his son in the past 10 years, but he does video chats and plays games with him once every 2-3 weeks.\n\n4 years ago, my brother\u2019s ex contacted me asking if I\u2019d be willing to talk to my nephew. And of course I said yes, and now I have a good relationship with both my nephew and his mom. Before she contacted me, I didn\u2019t even have a way to be in touch with them, because my brother didn\u2019t tell me anything (even when I asked).\n\nAfter talking to his ex-wife, I found out that my nephew had been begging my brother to come visit him for many years, but he always said he couldn\u2019t (due to work and other excuses). I know he can easily go visit him (he makes a lot of money and his job gives him a lot of leave).\n\nI\u2019m traveling soon and I\u2019ll be visiting my nephew and his mom. My nephew is really excited, he\u2019s always asked me when I\u2019ll visit him. I mentioned this to my brother (because I thought my nephew already told my brother), but my brother got upset and he told me not to see his son.\n\nTo add some more info, my relationship with my brother isn\u2019t that good to begin with. \n\nWIBA if I ignore him and visit my nephew anyway?\n\nEdit: I\u2019m female (so my nephew\u2019s aunt).\n\nEdit 2: In the past, he said he\u2019s not comfortable with me talking to his ex, and told me not to talk to her, just talk to my nephew (but he\u2019s a minor so it\u2019s a bit tough to bypass his mom).",
