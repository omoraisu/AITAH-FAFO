      "selftext": "I apologize if this is gumbled or doesn't make much sense.\n\nTo start things off, me (21F) and my boyfriend(19M) have been in and out of a few places. i had an add on roomies but we all know most apartment listing's are scams. I had a man reach out to me through roomies askingif i still needed a room. The room was 400 a month and everything included. No mention of pests from previous roommates or from himself. My boyfriend goes to see the apartment during the day, everything looks OK. The room was odd and had seal spray pretty much in every crack of the room. We are there for about a week, within this time we learn a lot. Including that our landlord is on probation and has had over 45+ roommates in n out in the past year (red flag), the oven does not work and his microwave was infested. By week two we are seeing a huge amount of roaches in the trailer. He started asking me to clean him room and bathroom which is completely out of tenant obligations. After I said no he continues to ask my boyfriend if I will clean for him. After this I keep my distance and my boyfriend completely ignores him when he asks. Time goes by and he's asking us to buy him a new microwave or just new things for him with little benefit to us. I asked if I could paint and fix the giant whole in our wall from previous roommates and he said yes! \"I will take it out of rent\" so of course I buy the plaster and paint, not ever a day after I fifinish the plaster he tells me the paint will not benefit him so he will not be taking it out of rent. I was so frustrated i still have not painted that room and honestly ddon't plan on it.\n\nOne day I finally broke down about the bugs and he just goes off on me. Saying he can just evict me because I'm starting problems aka me asking him to take care of his roach problem. And no the roaches are not from us, he told us he's been living with them for years. He also randomly told us he found bedbugs, HUGE no no because my boyfriend is allergic! Of course we were not told about those either when we moved in.\n\nA month goes by, he gets another roommate, doesn't mention anything to me or my boyfriend. Starts asking her for the same things but she did buy him a new microwave that is of course infested like his original one.  He also never mentioned anything to the new roommate about the bugs. The new roommate is starting to realize that all his shit talk on us isn't true and now knows why we are in our room almost 24/7, which she has now also started to do.\n\nI literally just want this man to get pest control so I can make food without 10 damn roaches falling in it.\n\nI live in michigan, don't know if that helps. I'd honestly appreciate any help on this because I'm at a loss. I do have pictures of him threatening eviction over ne asking him about the roaches.\n\n\n\nI do also want to mention me and my boyfriend moved in two months ago, our landlord JUST got a job like today.",
