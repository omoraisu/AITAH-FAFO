      "selftext": "I\u2019m a 24-year-old female living in India, and today, I had to call out my ex-crush. It's been months since we stopped talking, and I was the one who ended the friendship. He was constantly gaslighting me, guilt-tripping me, and making me feel worthless. He also took advantage of the fact that I had a crush on him. I was completely done with his hot-and-cold behavior and his refusal to ever admit his mistakes.\n\nTo make matters worse, he dumped his ex, who was a genuinely sweet girl, by saying, \u201cI still don\u2019t have feelings for you,\u201d after dating her for a year. It was her first relationship, and she was devastated\u2014so much so that she needed therapy for a month. Despite this, they stayed friends because he didn\u2019t want to break the bond (ugh, what an ahole). Even his best friend eventually distanced himself from him because he constantly meddled in his relationship, telling him things like, \u201cYou should dump her before she leaves you.\u201d His best friend also went through a lot emotionally because of him and faced a situation similar to mine.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets worse. His best friend was the first person I confided in about my crush, and, of course, he told him. After that, my ex-crush became even more flirty, despite already having a girlfriend. I told him multiple times to respect boundaries and not touch me, reminding him that he was in a relationship. Do you know what he had the audacity to say? \u201cMy girlfriend doesn\u2019t have a problem, so why should you?\u201d\n\nI was so close to slapping him that day, but instead, I calmly said, \u201cIt\u2019s my body, my choice.\u201d That incident happened a long time ago, but it stuck with me.\n\nYesterday, his ex-girlfriend (who knows nothing about why our friendship ended) confronted me, asking why we had stopped talking. I finally told her the truth. She was, understandably, pissed off, especially when I shared how he had been flirty while they were together. To be fair, his flirty nature was tolerable when he was single, but it was absolutely inappropriate in a relationship.\n\nThis morning, he called me, furious, demanding to know what I had told his ex. I responded, \u201cSo, you\u2019re angry because you\u2019ve been exposed?\u201d He didn\u2019t even bother to hear me out. Instead, he hung up and blocked me on all platforms. I was left thinking, The fvcking audacity of this guy!",
