      "selftext": "\nAbout 3 years ago my(23f) bf(27m) hungout with his cousin one night after getting mad at me for something. He was texting me and then stopped at like 9pm, I drove to his house the next night and something just told me that he had went somewhere that I don\u2019t like (I\u2019m pretty sure you can guess where), he unshared his location with me and told me he didn\u2019t know where he was going and that it was his cousin who took him there (I didn\u2019t realize it at the time, only recently that there\u2019s no way he couldn\u2019t have known cause he remembered to unshare his location and those places usually have signage. If he realized this and left as soon as he noticed is unknown to me but I guess it doesn\u2019t matter now). My dilemma is that after that happened I asked him to not hangout with that cousin for a while so we could rebuild trust in our relationship and I wouldn\u2019t have to worry about it reoccurring. Well now, he\u2019s going to hangout with all of his cousins, with the cousin in question possibly going to be there too. I told him I don\u2019t want him to hangout with any of his male cousins, but he swears it was only the one cousin who took him to that place, and that it won\u2019t happen again. And it hasn\u2019t happened again, but knowing that he might be hanging out with that cousin again concerns me and I feel really hurt that he doesn\u2019t understand my concern or that even after all this time it still bothers me. I don\u2019t want to be that gf that tells him he can\u2019t hangout with his family, but I don\u2019t like that cousin and I don\u2019t like that I\u2019m expected to just ignore my concerns and worries at his expense. I don\u2019t want to breakup but he\u2019s making it sound like it\u2019s an ultimatum, I either just ignore how I feel and he hangs out with them or we breakup. What do I do? How do I make him understand that this still bothers me? Is the only option to breakup? Other than this we\u2019ve been doing super good lately, and my own anxiety and insecurities aside, I think he loves me and I would hate for this to be the reason we breakup. ",

NTA to not like bf hanging out with these cousins, but it does sound like he's using them as an excuse for doing what he (bf) wants to do.\n\nHis behaviour and the lying about it. And I'm skeptical he went with only his one cousin. Like, I think if in a relationship there's a strong disagreement people can agree to disagree, IF there's honesty. Not if one person lies about why they went somewhere or with who.\n\nI mean, I think (I'm M) that there is space for a discussion if e.g. bf has a family member getting married and bachelor party has a stripper, that that might be an exception to usual rule between you (not saying it should be, just it would be fair to discuss). But if you can't trust bf to tell you the truth about where he went or why or about his phone or who went, even if he agreed to not hang out with this cousin, how could you believe him even if he said not hanging out with cousin?",
