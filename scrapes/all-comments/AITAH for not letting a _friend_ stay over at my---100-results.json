      "selftext": "Hi everyone \n\nI'm 25F. My \"friend\" is also 25F. I say it like that because we're not really friends. We had 1 class together 5 years ago and we did definitely bond, but we never spent any real time together. She moved away and we sort of kept in touch via social media but only by liking each others posts. \n\nJust some background: I stayed in campus accommodation for the majority of my adult life so far and only recently got a place of my own. I don't know how to say this but I'm MAJOR into privacy. I don't like other people in my space so I never invite people over. When people have to come over, or when I feel obligated to invite someone over, I'm so in edge and uncomfortable the entire time and get panic attacks before and after. This is something I've addressed in therapy and it's getting slightly better with time but I'm not quite there yet. \n\nBut this friend doesn't know this. She doesn't know that I lived on campus. She doesn't know that I've since gotten my own place. She doesn't really know anything personal about me. Although, I don't have ANY family. I was pretty aware that she at least knew this. \n\nAnyway, she sent me a Facebook message asking me if she can come and stay with me for about 3 weeks. Arriving THIS WEEK. Even if she assumed I had my own place, I feel it's weird to assume I had space and and the capacity to accomodate her for 3 weeks? But apart from all of that, we really never even spoke. Why would you want to live with someone you hardly know, for three weeks? \n\nShe's also one of those people who have thousands and thousands of Facebook friends so I also find it strange that she couldn't have asked anyone else. Maybe she did and no one else was available but... Yeah I don't know. \n\nI want to say no but I feel so bad. I feel like a bad person but wow... Isn't this a bit... Inappropriate? Please tell me if you think I'm in the wrong here.\n\nEdit/update: Thank you so much everyone for helping me navigate this, it really helped my anxiety a lot. I told her I won't be able to accommodate her and she asked if she can then ONLY keep her car at my place, then? Why would she ask that?... I don't feel comfortable with that either so I'll be saying no but I was just wondering why she'd ask.",
