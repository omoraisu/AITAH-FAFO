      "selftext": "Today, my cousin asked to borrow my car because hers was in the shop, and she needed to run some errands. I hesitated at first but eventually agreed, thinking it was just for a few hours and nothing could go wrong.\n\nA few hours later, I got a call from her, panicked and in tears. She had rear-ended another car at a stoplight, and my car was pretty badly damaged. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but the front bumper and hood were smashed.\n\nWhen I got to the scene, she admitted she was texting while driving. I was upset but tried to stay calm since we were in public and I didn\u2019t want to make things worse.\n\nNow comes the issue: I expected her to take responsibility for the repairs since she was at fault. However, when I brought it up, she said she didn\u2019t have the money and told me to claim it on my insurance instead. The problem is, my deductible is pretty high, and filing a claim will increase my premiums. I explained this to her, but she insisted she couldn\u2019t afford it and said it was on me because I had agreed to lend her the car.\n\nShe then said I was being unreasonable and that family should always help each other. I told her that borrowing a car comes with the basic responsibility of driving safely, and texting while driving was 100% on her.\n\nThings escalated when other family members got involved. Some are telling me I should just let it go and pay for the repairs to avoid conflict, while others agree that she\u2019s at fault and should figure out how to handle the expenses.\n\nNow I\u2019m stuck in the middle, with my car still damaged and no resolution in sight. So, AITAH for standing my ground and expecting her to take responsibility?\n\n",
