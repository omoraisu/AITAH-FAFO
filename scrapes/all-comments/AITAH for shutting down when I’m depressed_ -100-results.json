      "selftext": "I (29F) still live at home with my parents and 2 out of 3 of my adult sisters due to low paychecks and the state of the world keeping us from moving on with our lives. I have struggled with depression and anxiety since I was 6 years old, and self harm and suicidal ideation since 12. Growing up it was really hard to talk about my feelings and experiences because first of all I just couldn\u2019t put it into the right words as a child unknowing of mental health, but also being a middle child in a family of 6 I always felt talked over, invisible, or put down, primarily by my oldest sister always calling me stupid and annoying, etc. I was shy in school as well, so incredibly anxious that I didn\u2019t really start speaking in class and making real friends until I was in 11th grade. I have made so much progress in my mental health journey, and I am actually a social worker now providing counseling to K-12 students, and despite some low self esteem, it\u2019s the first time I can say that I am really good at something (it helps to have been a troubled kid in order to help troubled kids). I generally am doing fine, I of course am not in a fully comfortable place in my finances or romantically, and like any of us with life long clinical depression, I can at times feel things so much more deeply than i\u2019d like to, but most days I am quite well and committed to myself and my recovery. My issue is that when I do have momentary dips into a depressive state, I struggle so much trying to communicate with my family and it ends up making me feel so much more isolated than I\u2019d even been feeling to start. I know my parents went through hell getting me through surviving my teenage years and I owe them my life and I am extremely grateful to them and do everything I can always to help them out and be present with them, which I know they would agree with. But when my mood starts to fall in these more significant moments, it feels I am somehow doing it wrong. If I appear around the dinner table with a flat affect, despite my best efforts, everyone gets awkward and avoids me, making me shrink farther into myself and go back to being the invisible kid I was. I know many people in my family prefer to be left alone when not in a good mood, but I do prefer to be acknowledged in a compassionate way, like being pulled aside naturally and told, \u201chey it looks like you\u2019ve been going through something would you like to talk about? or just like a hug?\u201d I have had conversations letting my mother know this but I feel we are still getting it wrong someone. \n\n\nSorry this is so long winded but let me get to the example most recent to get the best advice on. I have been very depressed this past week and spent many days crying my eyes out in my room alone, avoiding more \u201cfamily time\u201d out of fear of the rejection of saying the wrong thing or being avoided. I also got too drunk on a night out recently which was very dumb as I was already depressed, and had a major breakdown that did shake my feelings of where I truly was in healing and recovery. My mom had asked at one point what was wrong and I just didn\u2019t know what to say at the moment, just depressed. Today at dinner she snapped at me for a silly mistake of throwing out the cranberry sauce and I just couldn\u2019t feign anything to hide the flat affect after that point because I just am so exhausted of being wrong. I tired to slide away and finish some washing up when she came to me and said, \u201cdo you want to talk about whatever is going on?\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say exactly, didn\u2019t want to say well I\u2019ve been crying my eyes out all week, or dive right into the most intimate of my feelings in the middle of the kitchen of how I have a crippling loneliness I fear will never end, so I thought the safest answer was, \u201cI\u2019ve just been having a sad week.\u201d She took this more accusatorially I guess and said, \u201cwell I have asked if you wanted to talk about it multiple times and you said no.\u201d Normally I go back to shrinking into myself because that felt so confrontational and that I\u2019ve fucked up again. But instead I said, \u201chow do you think that makes me feel? I am so tired of everything I do and say somehow being wrong.\u201d She said, \u201cwell how do you think it feels to hear you\u2019ve been sad all week?\u201d I wasn\u2019t meaning to be accusatory or had any ill attention in what I\u2019d said. But honestly I don\u2019t remember her giving me such an opening to really talk anyway. I tend to reply to questions like \u201chi how are you?\u201d with just \u201cfine\u201d because it doesn\u2019t feel like they\u2019re inquiring further, and I don\u2019t like to be asked in front of people I\u2019m not as comfortable with (such as older sister).\n\nAm I too picky and too stand offish at this point, too guarded, too presuming I will be judged that I am potentially unknowingly rejecting help I am being offered and not realizing? Am I waiting for the perfect circumstances to be heard and understood and truly seen and thus missing other opportunity? I feel so burned from having reached out for help and in fact being judged or put down or the family burden or the problem child that somewhat of a guard I feel is necessary. I like to handle absolutely everything myself to avoid being a burden and I go out of my way to help other people, especially my parents, but sometimes you do just need to reach out, but it always feels like it backfires for me. Am I giving my mom a fair enough chance to be there for me? How else can I approach her to ask for support in a way that doesn\u2019t make either of us feel ashamed or resentful. Or is my mom burnt out from having a depressed kid in her life for 29 years? Does she feel she did her time and this angst should be long gone? I promise I really do try to solve everything on my own and only reach out for help in these very bad moments, but I just need to know how I can fix this because I would love to have a relationship with my mom and my family where I can actually feel safe enough to confide in my depression and receive the support I really need sometimes. \n\nAm I doing something wrong? Am I being an asshole for being upset that no one seems to understand me still and show up for me in the way that I feel would help? Am I overly sensitive and misreading everything? \n\nMy depression is loneliness - the loneliness of rejections, being left out, never being chosen, not being good enough, always being too much but not enough, always making a mistake and failing others, always being wrong, the fear of never being truly loved because I will/have never been truly understood. Even my sadness being wrong to others hurts bad. \n\nAny advice is appreciated. I love my mom more than anything and we\u2019ve got a great relationship most of the time. Our miscommunication like this is what hurts us most, and it kills me to think we miss out on any time together even just hours by being upset. Please help me understand how I might be able to fix this. ",
