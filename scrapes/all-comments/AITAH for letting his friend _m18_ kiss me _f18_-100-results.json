      "selftext": "ive been talking to this guy for like a month after we met at a bar. on friday night we both went to the same house party so our friend groups met up. and i started talking to his friend to ask him for advice on how to talk to the guy i\u2019ve been talking to bc i was shy. and we spent like an hour going back and forth bc i was scared but we were rlly close so maybe it looked like the convo was going a different way. i took the advice and the guy i liked basically just said something i couldn\u2019t hear and turned back to his other friend. so i went back up to the friend giving me advice and told him what happened and he said \u201ci like you though, i wouldn\u2019t ignore you\u201d and he started kissing me. and the other guy obviously saw and told my friend he didn\u2019t want anything to do with me anymore. so after we left, my friend told me he said that so i started spam calling him on snap to explain and he unadded me. i dmed him on insta but he never responded so i unsent the text. and i went to the same bar as him last night to try and talk but he ignored me and said he was good. he told my friend he rly liked me before any of this happened, right before i showed up to the party. did i fuck this up really badly? am i the asshole or is his friend the asshole? \ud83d\ude2d",
