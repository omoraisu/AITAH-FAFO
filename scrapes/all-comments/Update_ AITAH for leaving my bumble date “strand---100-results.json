      "selftext": "Hey everyone, just a quick update.\n\nI appreciate all the comments and the different opinions on my previous post, however at the end of the day, the reason I posted it was because I felt guilty about what I did, and I agreed more with the comments stating what I did was wrong. Also my sister has never once given me bad advice in life, and I think her assessment was right this time too. \n\nSince I left Ana at the restaurant last week, she texted me a couple of times, but I just ignored those messages. I opened the messages a couple hours ago, and I was sort of surprised. Instead of lashing out at me, she just apologised again and said she was willing to stop seeing Josh if it meant we could continue our relationship. She said after the dinner, she just took an Uber back home and didn\u2019t go to Josh\u2019s.\n\nI texted Ana that there was no reason to apologise and I shouldn\u2019t have left her stranded at the restaurant and I should have also paid for her meal, since I was the one who invited her to the expensive restaurant. I asked Ana for her Venmo but Ana said she didn\u2019t care about the money and asked if we could continue our relationship. However, I didn\u2019t have the same feelings for Ana anymore so just I texted Ana upfront that I don\u2019t think we\u2019re compatible, and I don\u2019t want to continue this. We chatted a bit more, and Ana was very respectful of my decision, but admitted she was sad. I too admitted it was tough, but it\u2019s best for everyone that this doesn\u2019t continue further. \n\nThat was the final text and I definitely think there are valuable lessons learnt from this entire thing. Thank you all for your input.",
