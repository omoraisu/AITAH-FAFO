      "selftext": "I don\u2019t love my boyfriend anymore and don\u2019t think I have for a while now.\n\nIt sucks. This feeling really sucks. But I feel like once I list off the things that made me gradually fall out of love with him, it\u2019ll make sense. Maybe I\u2019ll reread what I\u2019ve listed off and realize I don\u2019t need to feel bad about it. \n\nThings to know about us are:\nWe have been together for under a year. He\u2019s 28m and im 24f\n\n- admitted to jerking off to Instagram pages of girls he knew irl for the first month and a half and stopped because he didn\u2019t realize it was a bad thing up until then\n\n- nearly had a porn addiction until I told him explicitly that if he started watching porn again that I would break up with him.\n\n- went on a 1on1 lunch break with a coworker he used to have a crush on without clearly mentioning it was 1on1. Also stating that the lunch room they had lunch in that is known for being the spot where everyone eats was completely empty that day.\n\n- didn\u2019t disclose how 2 of his closest friends in town are girls he used to have feelings for, 1 of which he asked out years ago AFTER I asked him the first time if he had any friends in his current life he used to have feelings for, but keeps around. I don\u2019t care if someone I\u2019m with has friends of the opposite gender, but if they are friends that had romantic attraction (even if it wasn\u2019t reciprocated), then that makes me uncomfortable. This topic was one we were able to set limits and an agreement on.\n\nThose are the main moments that always pop up in my head for me. He is the kindest man I\u2019ve ever been with and does a lot to look out for me. And I really like him. But I don\u2019t think I love him anymore to feel genuine in continuing our relationship past the new year. \n\n-posted this in another subreddit to get more opinions-",
