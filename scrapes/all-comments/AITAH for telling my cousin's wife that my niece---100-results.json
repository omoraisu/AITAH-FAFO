Often, I see her on her phone at family gatherings, especially at Christmas and birthday's.\n\nA few hours ago, I messaged her, I'll call her Lucy, and told her about it and she messaged me back asking me why and I messaged back saying that it was a bit weird and bad and she messaged back and said that the niece is paranoid that people judge her and is self-conscious. I apologised and said sorry. She said it's okay and that was it. I still feel bad that I asked her it and that I was being rude to her. I didn't want to write in my message that it was disrespectful because that would've been very bad. But to me, it was bad? Why was she on her phone when everyone else is talking during Christmas/birthday's?\n\nNow I know the truth and I still feel bad.",
