      "selftext": "I (31M) am engaged to my fianc\u00e9e (28F). I am an attorney. This year, I received a very sizable bonus from my job. This bonus is because three years ago I brought in a couple of cases. One case resulted in a large verdict we received this year. The other case resulted in a large settlement this year. \n\nI have been contemplating what to do with the bonus. I decided that I would pay off my house, take 90% of the remainder and save it, and then give my mom 10% of the remainder. My fianc\u00e9e asked me how much I planned to give her family. I do not plan on giving them any of it. As I see it, this is a way for me to pay back my mom for all the sacrifices she made for my education. And it is that education that allowed me to get this bonus. To say my fianc\u00e9e is pissed is an understatement. She says I am being selfish. I do not see it that way at all. Her parents did not contribute to my ability to get this bonus, so not sure why they should receive the benefit of it.  \n\nAITA?\n\n[Note: We share finances for our salary, but any type of bonus is generally spent as we each see fit. The difference here is this bonus is exponentially more than either of us ever receive in a year.] ",

Easy peasy.\n\nBut, the fact she came up with the expectation that you somehow \"owe\" her parents money is weird. It is doubly weird that she won't let this go, calling you names and being angry. Where is this coming from? For example, are you in North America, or is there some kind of foreign \u00a0cultural expectation thing happening here? OP, you need to figure this out because, as it stands, there are major red flags flapping in the breeze: are you prepared to be financially supporting her family/clan/whatever in perpetuity? Are you prepared to have them move in with you post-wedding due to a \"family emergency\"? Why did she agree to how bonuses are spent and then decide she could spend yours for you? Has she signed the prenup, or are you being delusional that she will do so sometime in the future after wedding plans have already commenced? How much does she take her resentment out on your mom? Is she giving you The Silent Treatment until you capitulate to her demands? And the big one: \u00a0Is it possible she likes your financial prospects more than she likes you? You needn't answer these questions to me; they are for you to contemplate.\u00a0",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA.</p>\n\n<p>You and your fianc\u00e9e had an agreement about the spending of bonuses. Your reasoning on how you wish to spend your money is sound. Your fianc\u00e9e is out of line. Easy peasy.</p>\n\n<p>But, the fact she came up with the expectation that you somehow &quot;owe&quot; her parents money is weird. It is doubly weird that she won&#39;t let this go, calling you names and being angry. Where is this coming from? For example, are you in North America, or is there some kind of foreign \u00a0cultural expectation thing happening here?
