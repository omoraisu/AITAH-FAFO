      "selftext": "my girlfriend's family never liked me. especially her father and eldest brother.                                         it is as if I had to prove myself to them or something.\n\nfirst I thought that maybe they were a bit skittish because we didnt know each other  however it became quickly obvious they detested me when they started bossing me around.\n\nI have lifted chairs and done some physically taxing chores,                                                         I have been asked to help them move.                                                                                         and they dont consider my time.                                                                                                      they expect me to drop everything down to tend to them.                                                           I was always singled out for lowly shit like that, but doing chores while everyone enjoyed their day is crazy.                                                                                                                                once I was volunteered to peel potatoes on my GF birthday, so I stepped out gave my GF the never went back because fuck them.\n\n\n\nanyway I guess they realized that them treating me like that would never work and it we've been chill not seeing each other.\n\nthey invited me for Christmas which I immediately turned down because first my sister is coming back from china for holidays and i dont want to spend an important day with people i dont like.\n\n  \nanyway my GF is giving me grief for turning them down because it was an olive branch \ud83d\ude02. fuck the olive branch.\n\nI have been Recieving a silent treatment for a while now.\n\n  \nam I the asshole for not giving a shit.\n\n\n\nam thinking about breaking up",
