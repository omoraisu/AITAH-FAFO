      "selftext": "Sorry for any typos, English is not my first language. I'm ( F39) an executive at my own firm and serve medium to large clients ( this is important to the story). I started my business from zero. Before that, I was struggling to get the money for my career project and was poverty shamed by my ex, who preferred social status. I'm mentioning this because that painful experience stuck with me.\n\nIt took me years, but I managed to start my company and slowly built a name for myself. I've dated different kinds of men, from wealthy to blue collar. None of them gave me the vibe that I'm getting from my current ex-boyfriend. \n\nI met Donnie ( M38) at a community event. He approached me. I'm 100% sure that his face is familiar. He reintroduced himself, mentioned my ex high school dance partner Jay ( M39), and told me that he and Jay were best friends back in college. We eventually hit it off, and to be fair, I had my panties all twisted over him. I was happy to experience the excitement and feeling giddy. He began to introduce me to his family members, and he met my family. Honestly, we've never even had a fight, not even during disagreements.\n\nLast summer, he began to act dismissive of my past connections ( not romantic, but platonic friends). He showed disdain for my preferences regarding hypothetical questions like \u201cwhere would you go if you could time travel\u201d. I said I wanted to revisit my childhood friends, and he said I'm being miserable because I'm inviting a part in my life where I live in an underprivileged area. He also tried to rush me into composing myself after I got emotional from remembering someone ( not romantic). I found this odd. He talks about his childhood a lot and grew up in a lower class area, and his family members still work low income jobs ( just saying). \n\nA few weeks ago, he mentioned that he approached during the event where we connected because \u201c the who's who\u201d treated me like royalty. This is an exaggeration, and I wasn't flattered. It didn't feel good, and it was u settling, and I told him. He said that I'm over reacting.\n\nRecently, we were having sex and saying sexy things to each other, and he blurted out that he \u201cfelt protected\u201d with me. I don't know if im being judgemental, but it felt weird and very off. I'm totally up for being in a relationship where we mutually protect each other, but he and I aren't at that stage. We've only been together for 13 months, no talks about the future except for things that he wants to do, like owning a business.\n\nI have been researching him on  and half of three things he claims about his past that  don't check out ( I can't get any info on the University where he earned his MBA, he said he eloped ( ex wife) but also said his uncle the regional bishop married them). \n\nI tried to talk to him about my concerns, but I didn't really get any answers. I don't want to get into a situation where my role would be to serve someone or provide for them without even getting a heads up first.\n\nI spent Thanksgiving week out of town and didn't feel like I missed him, but that may be because my guard is up, and I'm trying not to get hurt.\n\nWe saw each other yesterday when we went for a walk. I put my concerns on the table. His face changed. I said I would really like this to work out, but I wanted to express that I will not agree to be anyone's leg up or their door to success. I did mention things that have hurt/bothered me and that all I want is clarity. He said that I'm bullying him and that I'm trying to embarrass him for having a low paying job. I tried to explain that his job is the least of my concerns as I'm not expecting him to financially support me, but he needs to come clean. I don't want a relationship with a man who only approached me because he might have seen an opportunity for clout. The next thing that happened kind of felt embarrassing. He tried to smile, but what came out was a weird facial expression. I left it at that since we had plans to watch movies at home. After a few hours, he was more relaxed and tried to initiate sex but I felt very uncomfortable. He said that I'm all about status and quickly walked away.  This is very erratic, and I don't appreciate it, so I broke up with him right this morning. He sent me a message telling me about how emotional affinity should be prevalent over money and career and how incredibly disappointed he is. He also said that his marriage ended because his ex in-laws sabotaged the relationship because they thought he wasn't good enough.\n\nMost of my inner circle thinks I was right to end things, while others are telling me that he must have felt like I was trying to treat him as less. AITA ?\n\n\nEdit: I'm worrying that I might inadvertently done the same that my poverty shaming ex did to me.\n\n",
