      "selftext": "My boyfriend (34 M) and I (24 F) live separately, but he only lives down the street from me. I am a very independent person and always have been. Ever since I met him, we clicked and it was practically love at first sight for me. I met him when I was 18 turning 19 and everything was great for about a year and a half (if i remember the timeline correctly) until I was SA'd by my father at 19. I told my boyfriend what happened and of course he felt terrible that it happened to me. However, my sexual desires and preferences flipped like a switch, but our sex life continued as it had been. The sex was too frequent between my boyfriend and I, and we hadn't taken a break from sex even after i was assulted. This made me struggle to feel pleasure or even get aroused. This continued for weeks until I finally told him that our sex life was hurting me emotionally, mentally, and physically. He acknowledged my struggle, but it seemed like getting off was more important to him than my happiness and safety. After a long while of fighting for myself, sex turned unto something toxic. He would just go for it when I was sleeping, waking me in the worst way. He would beg me for sex even if I told him I can't do it because of my own health. I tried going through therapy for what happened between myself and my father and it helped tremendously. I have even forgiven my father for the steps he has taken to help himself and have me come back into his life as his daughter. However, by boyfriend has only \"changed\" a little bit since all of this started. He has stopped forcing himself on me, mostly, but still begs me for sex like its his lifeline or the only reason he's with me. He uses excuses as to why he deserves sex or \"how good he has been\" about it and he has earned some action. It has been 4 years now and I don't know why I'm still around. He isn't even really my \"boyfriend\" because he has horrible commitment issues but still doesn't wanna let me go, I'm so confused... After all these years I've only gotten worse. I've gained 25 pounds just being with him because he's unhealthy, I've lost my sex drive all together and I believe I've become mostly a-sexual because of my experiences and trauma. I've told him I don't love him the same and even told him \"I don't love you anymore\" several times. Yet he still won't let me go, guilt trips me for not giving him sex, even guild tripping me for not wanting to spend time with him. I see him at least once a week if not almost every day and he always uses \"we are best friends\" to guilt me into seeing him or doing things for him. I've wanted to end this all for so long and don't know how to do it. My heart is too soft and maliable for his guilt tripping and it makes me always fall back like a fool. It doesn't help that he lives so close. I've told him to date other girls and have sex with other people so he can leave me alone but none of that has worked. We argue all the time. During these arguments, I usually just want to leave and take time to cool down instead of yelling at eachother. Sometimes he will stand un front of the door and prevent me from leaving until i push past him. One time he literally kicked me out after pushing past him by putting his foot against my backpack and pushing me out of the doorway (not hard, but still). I don't want things to get worse or progress to physical abuse. I know I'm being abused mentally and sexually, I just don't know how to stop it permanently. I'm just suffering at this point and don't know if I'm in the wrong for falling out of love. ",
