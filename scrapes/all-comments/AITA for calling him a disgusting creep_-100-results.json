      "selftext": "\nI 27F felt so disturbed by 28M but I keep wondering if I invited it and if I did enough to stop it.\n\nI dumped him after 3 dates but weeks later I keep doubting if I overreacted or if it was my fault this happened. Be honest, you can tell me if it\u2019s my fault.\n\nI was a bit drunk on all 3 dates as I was very nervous having not dated in years.\n\nMaybe I should have told him to not do anything sudden.\n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nOn date 2 we were talking about mental health and he nonchalantly said he\u2019d attempted multiple times, I felt like hugging him but we hadn\u2019t hugged yet so I said I\u2019d had similar struggles and I said I think about it often too. Then he suddenly said, **\u201cI bet you have scars on your arms! Let me see.\u201d**\n\nIt felt so weird but was it just a joke? Cause we both had dark humour and when he\u2019d mentioned poetry and euthanasia and if I knew of Sylvia Plath, **I had said** \u201cyeah, the one who put her head in an oven? Can\u2019t do that anymore.\u201d I know that sounds insensitive but I was just using dark humour. Him asking to see scars felt different and invasive.\n\n-Later we walked into some trees and he joked it was a \u201cgood place to hide a body\u201d. I later said \u201cI just want to kiss only\u201d and **he LIED, \u201cDw I wouldn\u2019t take advantage.\u201d And he\u2019d said \u201cI\u2019m a nice guy\u201d twice already.**\n\nWe made out and he said I could touch his butt so then he touched mine, I was ok but then at a point he turned me around and pressed quite hard on my privates (over clothes), it felt uncomfortable so I moved back and he stopped. Ok. \n\nBut then he took both my arms and held them up and out on two instances. I didn\u2019t process my discomfort immediately. I later asked him about a bdsm page he followed and he said he liked bondage and he even (so early) suggested we could have a safe word.\n\n**I told him later I didn\u2019t like when he held my arms up and I don\u2019t want to feel restrained before I know someone very well. And that I\u2019d just woken from a nightmare.** He wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t remember exactly when or why I did that, I think I was just exploring you, sorry about the nightmare, hope you rest well.\u201d\n\n**I said I don\u2019t want to go further than kissing before knowing each other well and he didn\u2019t reply for an hour. Then he just wrote \u201cIs there anything you\u2019d like to know about me?\u201d As if to cut to the chase. Why didn\u2019t he just say \u201cOk I understand, we\u2019ll not rush.\u201d?**\n\n-On date 3 he suddenly said **\u201cthe trees smell like c-m\u201d which I brushed off as a lame joke but over the course of like 2 hours he said it three times.** \n\n-Then he asked me about my shoes and he said he wears heels and did drag. I was curious and asked if he\u2019d been with men. He said just kissing. **I shouldn\u2019t have asked this, maybe this is why later he kept steering the conversation to sex. Maybe it\u2019s my fault.**\n\n-We were talking about family and normal things. Then **he asked if a scratch on my thigh was from a shaver. I said no probably I scratched it. He said no that looks like it\u2019s from a shaver. I said I laser them. I said it\u2019s annoying to be hairy. He said he\u2019s hairy too and pulled up his shirt. I was quite drunk and said I like that and it\u2019s weird we\u2019re expected to be hairless as adults.**\n\n**But then he asked if I also lasered my \u201cc\u2026chie\u201d and I looked down and away. Then he said he shaves his \u201cshaft\u201d.** I didn\u2019t know what to say.\n\n-I said I\u2019d deleted my Instagram to not waste time and he said **\u201dYeah my Instagram is full of cats and p-rn.\u201d** Steering the conv to sex again. He said it was women in cosplay \u201cdoing their little sexy dances.\u201d I didn\u2019t know what to say, why didn\u2019t I just ask to change the subject?\n\nI said \u201cp-rn is ruining how we relate to each other.\u201d He agreed and said some lame joke about \u201cyeah it\u2019s all like suck my d\u2026., goodbye!\u201d And I said yeah it literally sucks and looked away straight faced. **I was trying to avoid conflict and up til then I\u2019d liked him and wanted to salvage the situation.** and I really was starved of connection and doing very badly mentally and wanted to cuddle with someone. \n\n-Then **he said he had an OF and I was taken aback, I just asked if he had posted identifying stuff and he said no but it was mostly guys messaging him so he stopped.**\n\n-**His profile had said \u201cnon smoker\u201d and he smoked and said to ignore the profile, he wanted to quit.**\n\n-When we made out **he (not rushing) tried to put his hand in my pants but i took his hand gently away and he stopped but he asked \u201cwhy? Are you on your period?\u201d We were outside and there was no need for me to justify my NO. But I said nothing and just kissed him. Then later he said if he showed me his i\u2019d show him mine \u201ctit for tat\u201d.** But he didn\u2019t try to put his hands in again.\n\n-Then he told me I could touch him so I did over his pants, He **said that if I made him c-m in his pants he\u2019d kill me cause that takes ages to clean.** Weird \u2018joke\u2019 to say on a 3rd date barely knowing someone.\n\n-He asked if I wanted to go to his place and I half-joked if he\u2019d ghost me after and he said \u201cHas that happened to you? **I don\u2019t think I will do that.\u201d** Which had me feeling he was saying he MIGHT.\n\n-I had also texted that I was melting from heat and getting motion sick on a long taxi ride and he\u2019d texted, **\u201cYou\u2019re putting yourself through hell to hang out I\u2019m honestly impressed \ud83d\ude01\u201d then later \u201cthere\u2019s a breeze hope you\u2019ll be comfy\u201d but that was two opposite things.**\n\n-Also **he\u2019d asked me my fears at one point. Then i asked his and he said he didn\u2019t have any.** ???\n\n-The worst part. He hugged me tight normally from behind but then **he started squeezing and I felt my breath start to be pushed out.**\n\nThis happened fast in like 2 seconds. I exhaled, \"Too tight.\" With some difficulty. He stopped, said sorry, then **immediately squeezed (lightly this time) again for like a second before fully stopping.** It felt like him purposefully pushing boundaries. Why didn\u2019t he immediately stop? But I kept kissing him later cause I didn\u2019t process what he did immediately.\n\nI complained about it and said I wanted to break things off and we had a back and forth with me saying how hurt I was about that squeeze cause I wasn\u2019t able to catch my breath, and this wasn\u2019t working out. His text responses were:\n\n\u201cI understand and I agree\u201d (meaning he agreed to stop meeting). \u201cI still primarily don\u2019t want to cause any discomfort.\u201d He seemed unsurprised that I had just told him I hadn\u2019t been able to catch my breath.\n\n\u201cOk I\u2019ll leave you be, I\u2019m honestly sorry for all this hardship.\u201d\n\n\"I really tried\n\n\u201c**it's not really fair** you know I didn't mean anything bad, this is too rough for me to deal with. \n\n\"**I didn't even realize** I did it so tight\n\n\u201c**I just hugged you I'm twice the size of you** (he\u2019s not, more like 50% bigger than me)\n\n\"**I can't be that delicate** and i obviously didn't do it on purpose\n\n\"**Didn't all the good time we have outweigh that one split second**?\n\n\"That's why **this isn't fair I've been complimented on my hugs** more than I have not lots of people like being held tightly (completely ignoring the fact I'd said no and that **I WROTE THAT I HADN\u2019T BEEN ABLE TO BREATHE.** It wasn\u2019t just a hug.)\n\n\u201cThose two seconds have caused so much hardship I am sorry. I really think we should leave each other alone (here I think he was realising I wouldn't just let him do anything he wanted to me) (I said it felt like he didn\u2019t care and I was hurt by this)\n\n\u201cAre you really trying to upset me? I do care **you have to leave room for mistakes** to happen nobody's perfect in two days of meeting them.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019s a bartender, very socially skilled and said he\u2019d had around \u201c13 or 14\u201d previous partners so how the hell did he not know it wasn\u2019t ok to treat a woman like that? How did any woman ever stay with him???\n\nAlso at a point I said I hadn\u2019t dated much cause it was hard to trust and he blurted, **\u201dYeah. Men, we\u2019re cons.\u201d** I couldn\u2019t believe he said that. \n\nAnd later he said he wasn\u2019t comparing me to a dog but that my eyes reminded him of the love in a dog\u2019s eyes. Weird. Someone said it was negging? Was it? I said it bothered me and he said he meant it nicely and that he had loved his dog with his \u201cwhole heart, and holding you like that was jealous on my end\u201d. Made no sense.\n\nHe wasn\u2019t affectionate at all just went straight to touching private areas.\n\nAt the end he also made some weird mansplaining comment and told me \u201cmen get wet too, there\u2019s this thing called precum\u201d. Wtf. Mansplaining that?",
