      "selftext": "Okay. So. I have noticed that every time my boyfriend (30m) takes Sildenafil, we get into a fight. He has ADHA and takes vyvanse most days (Monday-Friday). On days he takes Sildenafil, we get into a fight about one thing or another. I literally made a joke last time I gave him one and said we couldn\u2019t fight today.  Today, I gave him a pill because it\u2019s been a good 4-6 days since we were last active. I like to have sex everyday but he is good once or twice a week. \nWe got into a fight about DoorDash tonight\u2026 like, the most trivial thing. I swear he is the kindest, most considerate, sweetest man. We hardly ever fight. He literally left and got me top ramen because I was craving it at 1:30am the other night. He left right before the store closed to get it for me. \n\nBut when he takes Sildenafil, we almost always fight. I gave it to him today after not having sex for awhile and we got into a fight around 7-8pm about ordering DoorDash. I suggested we order before things close and he said nothing so I called my mom to talk about school work and he interrupts and after awhile he said places were about to close. I immediately hung up the phone and placed my order. When I gave him his phone back, he said it was too late and they were closing. One thing lead to another and the fight processed (from his prospective it\u2019s because I made it sound urgent and then it wasn\u2019t urgent) when I told him I notice we fight when he takes the Sildenafil. He got very angry at me and said he won\u2019t stand for it. He said he never brings up my medication (Zoloft) when we fight. \n\nAITAH in this situation?? He has ADHD and when I ask him something, if he\u2019s in the middle of something else, he\u2019ll take several minutes before replying. I didn\u2019t think it would be a problem for me to call someone while I wait. \n\nTl;dr, does Sildenafil make anyone grumpy or has anyone noticed they fight with their boyfriend when they take this? Just looking for other similar stories. Any advice would be appreciated. ",
