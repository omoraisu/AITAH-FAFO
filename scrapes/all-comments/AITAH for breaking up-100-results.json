      "selftext": "TW suicide / NSFW\n\nThe story begins when I (M19) became friends with a girl (let\u2019s call her A). After some time, I developed feelings for her and confessed, but she rejected me.\n\nA few weeks later, I met another girl online (we\u2019ll call her B). We started an online relationship. It began with sexting, but very quickly, it became more emotional. My connection with B lasted only one or two weeks, and we never met in real life. I\u2019m not sure, but she might have been a catfish. She told me some hard-to-believe stories about her life. Once, she sent me fake pictures, and when I asked for a verification photo, she sent one where she was covering her face. So, while I was sure she was a girl, I was never sure what her face actually looked like.\n\nB tried to break up with me three times. The first time was because of a mistake I made. The second time, she said she wasn\u2019t ready for a relationship and wasn\u2019t in a good mental state. I insisted and tried to save the relationship, and it worked for a while. But soon after, she said again that she couldn\u2019t be in a relationship and we should break up. This time, I accepted, and she blocked me. A few hours later, she unblocked me and asked me to help her with her studies, so I did. Then, I suggested we could be \"friends with benefits,\" and she agreed. The reason I suggested this was because the sexting had been good. I clearly told her that we could both date other people, and she agreed.\n\nA day or two later, A texted me, asking if we could meet. I regret it, but I told B that I was going to meet A the next day. She freaked out, said she loved me, begged me not to meet A, and acted like she was going to commit suicide. To stop her from doing that, I told her I wouldn\u2019t meet A, but she went offline as if she was about to hurt herself. The next day, I met A. We just had coffee and talked for a while. That night, B texted me again. I told her I was really sorry, but we couldn\u2019t continue because of her family situation, etc. She begged me not to leave her. Because of that, I told her I wouldn\u2019t leave, but a few minutes later, I texted her saying we couldn\u2019t be together. I then blocked her. She texted me from different numbers, and I blocked those too.\n\nNow, months have passed. I have a healthy relationship with A. B is still alive, but I don\u2019t really care about her anymore. However, I still feel guilty. I imagine scenarios where karma ruins my current relationship. What if one day A dumps me like that? What if she finds someone else and leaves me?",
