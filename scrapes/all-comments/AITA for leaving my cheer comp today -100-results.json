      "selftext": "Ik many of you don\u2019t understand cheer, but I really need some advice. I\u2019m 14 years old. A backspot to an amazing flyer on an elite team. I had a comp today where my main base was on vacation so we got a replacement base and every day for the past week or so when we\u2019ve had her practice with us we drop stunts and today we took my flyer and her mom to our competition. We live about three hours away from it and today when we were in warm-ups the first one that we did we dropped and our flyer  got very very hurt. We had to take her to the ER and my coaches yelled at me for trying to leave with my flyer even though I didn\u2019t have a ride home at first they told me to leave and the gas let me and told me not to Leave. Was AITA?? Please I just need some opinions here when we got home. There was a post that went up on Facebook that was publicly passing me and bullying me about what I chose to do today and my coach publicly said on the Facebook page that I might be kicked off the team for this little attention seeking stunt is what she called it. Please I just need some help, I\u2019m 14 and I\u2019m scared. I\u2019ve been in cheer my entire life and I have no idea what to do",
