      "selftext": "I\u2019ve been with my current girlfriend for about 3 months, and she told me about 2 weeks ago that her ex was texting her almost nonstop, and uses fake phone numbers to reach her when she blocks them. She just got her number changed, but only after I asked her to. This plus what happened today, makes me suspect that maybe she\u2019s not quite as innocent in this as she says, and I can\u2019t help but wonder if she\u2019s leading him on or giving him false hope somehow. Basically, I\u2019ve told her how I want to clobber him, and she told me that it makes her uncomfortable when I say stuff like that. I didn\u2019t want to stop, because I want her to know that I can protect her, and I feel like she doesn\u2019t see me as a real man when she won\u2019t let me even talk about confronting him even tho he\u2019s just some fat prick. \n\nToday we were at the super market and as we got close to the till, she told me to just drop our basket and basically dragged me around the aisle and out the front door. She told me when we got out that she saw her ex, then she got a text and showed me her phone, and it was an unknown number, she had two texts from it one was literally \u201cI miss you xx\u201d and the other was \u201ci seen u with another guy u cunt\u201d. I asked her why she didn\u2019t point him out to me and she said she just wanted to get out of there she was scared, and it made me feel real insecure and I said I could of dealt with it. She said she don\u2019t want us to meet or fight or anything and so I asked her why she didn\u2019t block the new number if she got that first text with xs a day ago. She said she just didn\u2019t think to and I said I don\u2019t believe her. I said she either thinks I can\u2019t win in a fight against some other guy or she\u2019s hiding something. She started crying and saying \u201cyou don\u2019t understand\u201d and that she doesn\u2019t care about whether I can win a fight she just doesn\u2019t want one of us to be killed coz the police don\u2019t care about it, I said she\u2019s avoiding the question why did she not block his number. She asked what I\u2019m playing at and I said I think maybe she\u2019s letting him think he still has a chance. She got angry saying that she has made it clear that she wants nothing more with him, but I said then why is he sending her \u201cxx\u201d and acting like she\u2019s his. \n\nShe said she won\u2019t talk to me when I\u2019m shouting and made me take her home. She said not to text her until she texted me and that she\u2019s real disappointed in me. She still hasn\u2019t got back to me I don\u2019t know what I should do. I don\u2019t want this guy harassing her but I feel like I need to know how much she\u2019s letting him think they still together even if it\u2019s not on purpose, I want her to think about it. I also want her to know that I can defend her and myself especially with someone like him. She gets so upset when I talk to her about this and she makes it hard to say anything. ",
