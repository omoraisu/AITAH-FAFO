      "selftext": "I\u2019m like a personal therapist for my family and I really need to stop engaging with their troubles because it\u2019s only ruining my life. But when I give the advice they seek for, oh I\u2019m wrong for telling the truth. Exactly like my sister, my sister marriage isn\u2019t perfect. Op(25F)\n\nMy sister (34F) is someone you would call who has no sense of mind, she\u2019s been with her husband (40F) for 11 years now and it\u2019s been pretty rough. They have two girls together and one on the way, they don\u2019t get along but they\u2019re still together. My bil cheated on my sister many times but she took him back because his sweet nothings did something to her, he cheated on her with a 19 year old(gross man) she found away to blame the women. \n\nAnytime he would cheat she would call crying asking me what should she do and I didn\u2019t beat around the bush. I told her the truth, she needs to leave him and don\u2019t stay for the kids. \n\n\nShe finds a way to get mad at me and hangs up, from that I told myself to not engage with her business anymore. With anyone, if anyone came to me for advice I would just mind my business. Now here we are dealing with the same problem again, my sister called to tell me her husband was talking to another woman and she doesn\u2019t know what to do. This was a cycle and I need in the end she would blame me and take him back, I told her to stop calling me about his cheating if she won\u2019t leave. Aita?",

Sometimes this proves to be the downfall of people who stay in abusive or not good for them relationships.\n\nOn the other hand,  she may be really upset with the current situation but is financially dependant upon her husband and realises the technical difficulties a potential divorce may bring. \n\nFinally,  Sometimes people just say something in the heat of an argument but all they want is a sympathetic ear to listen to them.\nYou can always tell your sister that Albert Einstein defined insanity is when one does the same thing over and over and expects a different result. But at the end the choice is hers, so are the consequences of that choice too, so maybe next time, if you feel like giving advice just turn the tables and ask your sister what does she think would be the best thing to do?\n\nI do understand your point though: you ask me for me advice,  I give you my advice and then you by-pass it completely. It is a disrespect of the time you have given to really listen and try to support by giving guidance.\n\nYou are right, minding your own business and using your own advice only for your benefit is sometimes your best choice.\n\nI do wish you and your sister all the best.\ud83d\ude4f",
