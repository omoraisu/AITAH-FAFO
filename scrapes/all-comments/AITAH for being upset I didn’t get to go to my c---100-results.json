      "selftext": "Let me set the screen. I've got to go back 27 years...short story my dad cheated on my mom while she was pregnant with twins, twins born early in NICU for 8 weeks, 2 days after discharged home my dad moved out and in with his girlfriend (same girl from cheating). When he left he pretty much wiped his hands of us kids 18, 13, 2x2 months. I've tried to have a relationship with him but he's so self-absorbed he doesn't have a relationship with any of his 5 biological children (I have a half sister from his gf made wife). \n\nThis weekend my cousin on my dads side got married. He was not invited because my cousin told me & my sisters it was more important to her that we were there not him. \n\nIt was a no kid wedding which was fine, we have 4 boys 18(high functioning autistic), 15, 12, 6. We had childcare set up. My husband and I were looking forward to the weekend away. \n\nFriday our youngest came home from school with a 12 hour stomach bug that had been going around his classroom. My husband and I discussed what to do about the wedding which was a 4 hour drive away from home. We decided to wait to see how he felt Saturday morning, figured he would feel fine and he did. \n\nWe called the person who was going to stay with but she didn't want to stay with them any longer as her full time job is day care with infants. Which was what I figured. We discussed leaving the boys home but ultimately decided that was a bad idea as our 18 yo & 12 yo cannot get along and not fair for 15 year old to play referee. \n\nWe stayed home.  Didn't go to wedding. I'm upset. I'm upset I didn't get to go to her wedding. I'm upset it was a family function that I didn't have to watch my back for my dad the entire night. I'm upset that my husband and I didn't get our time away. I'm upset we couldn't trust our kids. \n\nHe thinks I just have moved on. Basically say oh well didn't get to go and move on. No big deal I didn't get the time with family with no worries. He's pissed at me that I'm upset. AITAH?",
