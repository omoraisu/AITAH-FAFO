      "selftext": "I need to know if I\u2019m in the wrong here. I have always been a difficult child for my parents. When I was young, I was bullied by a cousin of mine who would tell me we were playing a game of pretend fight, and then my cousin would proceed to physically abuse me because in this game of fight he was much stronger and older. He would punch, kick, and do things that hurt. The most painful thing he would do was push a finger against the middle of my chest as hard as he could. Usually it was not bad enough to leave marks, but many times it got bad enough that I would be crying in pain. I don\u2019t know that my parents knew the extent of the abuse, but I know that they knew that some level of abuse was happening. Despite this level of abuse, I was always taught that family was the most important thing and that they were my cousins so we would continue to spend time with them. As I got older my cousin also became emotionally abusive. \n\nBecause of this, I have always had a chip on my shoulder and I have not tolerated any kind of abuse. Many times growing up, if I felt threatened, I would defend myself, usually with excessive force. This included if kids were smaller than me. To give one example, on a trip to visit really extended family, a child came after me when I was about 12 or 13 and started hitting me with a rather large toy car and I pushed him away. There was no acknowledgment by anyone in the group that I was being attacked by a child with a toy, I just remember being told I was a bully and that I needed to be better. I remember being in huge trouble the rest of the day with my parents and extended family because of this. I spent the entire day in shame, but feeling like it was only partially deserved and I always felt I had been betrayed because my mom would always rush to the defense of the younger child immediately so she wouldn\u2019t look bad in front of family and friends. This is not the only time it happened and my father would react in a similar way. After these episodes would happen, I would be made to feel I was a bully, even though almost every time I felt like I had felt threatened. I never felt like similar things happened with my sisters.\n\nWhen I was in K-12 school, my mom in particular, would always judge my grades really harshly. I was always an above average kid, but am the son of a customer service rep at car dealers, and a stay at home mom, who did some secretary work until I was about 2 or 3. This probably doesn\u2019t matter but we are Latinos. Despite this my mom in particular was very demanding that I get top grades. When I was in first, second, and third grade, I would give my best effort in everything, but on occasion would get C\u2019s because despite my full engagement, I was either bored or overwhelmed. \n\nMy mom would punish me and not let me play video games, which was what I most enjoyed to do for fun, for months at a time (until I got the next report card) when I\u2019d get C\u2019s. Sometimes she was a little lenient and she\u2019d put me kind of on probation, but this became a recurring thing. My problem from Kindergarten to 3rd grade was not lack of effort, but instead not understanding where effort was best allocated for the best grades.\n\nIn fourth grade, I decided effort was not rewarded, so I stopped trying meaning I stopped doing my homework. I would do my homework in school as class was going on because I wanted to go home and play with Legos or video games if I wasn\u2019t punished. I didn\u2019t want to do homework, I would already spend enough time at school doing work. I was always a great test taker and I understood the concepts taught in school very well. I would regularly get As, Bs, and Cs despite putting all my effort into being ready for tests. To give an idea of how well I understood the material, when I was in 5th grade, my last year in elementary school, I took Florida\u2019s standardized test, the FCAT, and scored the highest of anyone in my entire school, including kids who were in special classes for gifted children which my teachers had talked about me going to, but never did the paperwork for me to do so. I continued this from 4th grade onward. Anytime I got a C my mom would put me in the mentioned probation and would then proceed to not let me play video games until the next semester if I came up short, but at that point I stopped caring. I made it through all of middle and high school, with this attitude and it worked. I graduated high school with a 3.29 GPA, which while it was not by any means perfect is perfectly respectable for a person who mostly took honors classes.\n\nWhile my sisters were in school they got Cs in classes and I expected my mother to treat them similarly. My mother would make excuses for them and say they are trying their best and they just can\u2019t get there. This was infuriating to me, as at least when I was in Kindergarten to 3rd grade, I actually had given my full effort, but she would punish me in a way that I thought was cruel as I enjoyed video games more than any other activity I could do.\n\nOnce I was done with school, I did some religious service for two years. I was only allowed to communicate with my family by email once per week and had two phone calls per year on Christmas and Mother\u2019s Day. My family did support me here and I appreciated them for doing so. This is an expectation in my faith, which we have been members of my whole life. The time I spent was in Peru, I know my mom tried to make some friends during this period of time. When I got back however they expected me to quickly reintegrate back into my previous life and be who I had been. My father would make fun of me because of some of the phrases I\u2019d say and make it sound like some of the habits I had developed in my time there were a bad thing. My sister did the same type of religious service and went to Brazil, and my parents actively sought out friendships and made friends with tons of Brazilian people. When she came back she was allowed to transition her life without crazy pressure to be more like us again immediately.\n\nAfter returning home from my service, I was highly motivated to keep my life moving, get married, do some schooling and start a career. I got married pretty young (this is typical in my faith) worked hard and got a Master\u2019s degree in 3 years and started working in my career. I move out of my parents house when I was 22, and returned for 2 weeks at one time when I was between jobs. I have worked hard not to be a burden to them. My sisters have not done the same, my sisters attempted college and failed miserably. They would fail very basic courses like physics 101, chemistry 101 and most basic math courses. \n\nBoth my sisters got married, and one had an ugly divorce with a daughter. During that period of time, her ex-husband threatened me once and my parents got angry at me for asking my sister why her husband thought it was ok to threaten me, we got into a swearing match but my dad told me that it was my responsibility to not let arguments get like that. There was no repudiation to my sister about her behavior, even though her husband threatened me, and she started swearing at me.\n\nAs time has gone by, my parents have served as baby-sitting for my sisters\u2019 kids and have had my sisters\u2019 live in their house for really extended periods of time. Both of my sisters are currently married and leech off my parent\u2019s as much as possible. I occasionally ask my parents to watch my kids at night when I want to take my wife on a date. This happens like once every month or two.\n\nRecently, I was asked to help my father bring my grandfather into town as my grandfather has been incapable for awhile of taking care of himself as he is too old and has serious dementia issues. I am a CPA and was asked to do this during the busiest time of the year.\n\nDuring this trip, I told my dad that when he dies he should give my inheritance to my sisters instead of me since neither of them have a house that they own. He told me that he was already planning on doing that as it was what my mom\u2019s father had done for my mom\u2019s sister when he died. He left my mom a tiny amount and gave my aunt his entire interest in a house they owned together and all of his assets. While I was planning on giving it anyway, it hurt me deeply that my father would not have the courtesy to ask me if that was ok. I own a house, rental properties, have a high-paying job and am well for myself. Regardless of all this, I am the result of my choices and have consistently made the most advantageous choice I can to get my wife and kids ahead. With those choices have come large sacrifices of time and effort that my sisters have not made. Whether or not they get that money, should have been my choice and I was going to do it. By not giving me the choice I feel my father is punishing me for making the right choices.\n\nRecently, at my parent\u2019s house, my sister\u2019s tone towards my wife, who is the most reasonable person I know, while my wife was asking her daughter to calm down because she was yelling at my son and wife since she wanted a particular seat where my son had sat, made my wife feel insulted enough that she, without telling anyone, left the house. When I realized what had happened, I told my kids we needed to go and left my parents house.\n\nMy parents wanted to know what had happened and I told my mom my sisters behavior towards my wife wasn\u2019t acceptable and that we shouldn\u2019t be treated like outsiders. My mom says she treats us all the same and is always helping all of us. Referring to how much more her and my dad help my sisters, I simply said mom you take care of my kids every once in a while. She got upset and we haven\u2019t talked since. I have made a determination that I don\u2019t really want a relationship with any of them. My parents give their all to my sisters, I am left with the scraps and I\u2019m tired of being treated like my wife, kids and I don\u2019t belong.",
