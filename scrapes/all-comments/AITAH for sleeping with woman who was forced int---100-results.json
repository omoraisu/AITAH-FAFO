      "selftext": "I am 24F from a pretty conservative country. I am lesbian but only my friends and people I trust very much know. Last year I moved out of parents house and got myself a appartment. It was hard find but I settled in a not so well to do society.\n\nI love the people here and they have been very nice to me. I met one woman who I kind of vibed with. She is 46 and was in arranged married since she was 21. I spent a lot of time with her and learned some dark truths about her. \n\nI felt safe to tell her truth about and it got her really surprised. She was interested in knowing things like how it felt to be with woman and what not. She said our generation is lucky to get to live as we want. I dug further and she confessed to having interest in women. I was the first person she told.\n\nOver the months we grew pretty close and we eventually slept together. I told this to my friends and most of them were either not really judging or didn't want to say it. Some of them commented about her cheating on her husband. For her divorce is very difficult option for multiple reasons. Then coming out is much more than that. Her marriage is result of society pushing her into it, which she can't leave.\n\nEdit: I did not tell my friends who she is, or even that she is from our society. Also I trust them not to seek out who it is or even be interested in knowing.",

Whether she was just living out a life long curiosity \u2014 also doesn\u2019t matter, you shouldn\u2019t have told your friends, regardless of if nothing can ever come of this relationship, etc. Respect for her should have been and should be the main concern. You would turn her life completely upside down if anything were to come out, and people became aware. As someone else mentioned, depending on the culture she could be punished for dishonouring her family\u2014 this could be many things from being shunned in the community to being killed. As a woman, whose Husbands ex-wife committed adultery with her best friend \u2014 another woman, with a 6 month old baby involved\u2026 I have lived the other side of this life. I was the one questioned in the community if \u201chey are you the new woman in the situation where a teacher cheated on her husband with another woman from this place of employment?\u201d I was the one considered to be the other woman who broke up the marriage. I live in a SMALL community and everybody knew my business before I even knew them! These are all realities she, and you, would have to face, but tbh, they\u2019re going to be waaayyyy worse for her, than they are for you. My husband went through complete HELL\u2026 and his ex-wife & her now wife\u2026 didn\u2019t have a care in the world. They actually took us through the court system and changed our visitation from every other weekend to Summer Holidays & Christmas at the same time as we were petitioning the courts for 50/50 shared custody as she petitioned the courts to move him to GERMANY because her now wife was a LIMA Canadian foreign worker whom received her Canadian citizenship & only had to remain in Canada for a year to solidify it \u2026 decided that they had no opportunities for her wife for work here so thought it was in the child\u2019s best interest to move him to a fucking foreign country. (Sorry, still a lil peeved at this.) In reality, if knowing the entirety of the situation, it was because they made such a mess of their lives here in Canada, they had nobody to turn to and the only people that would support them were the now wife\u2019s family in Germany. \nYou would be throwing chaos everywhere is essentially what I\u2019m trying to get at here\u2014 and nobody really needs that.  As well, like I mentioned earlier\u2014 she could have just been living out a life long curiosity, and it kinda seems like you took advantage of the situation. \n\nNotice how I didn\u2019t even bring up the adultery as the main point\u2014 because it\u2019s not, but it still makes YTA.",

Arranged or not, no one deserves to be cheated on and it was wrong to do that to her husband. \n\nYou are also wrong for putting her in a potentially dangerous situation. Like you mentioned, divorce is hard to get in your country, especially for a woman. I\u2019m going to guess, rather safely, that if her husband finds out and he initiates divorce for infidelity, she will most likely get nothing and will also possibly never see her children again. She may even be abandoned by her birth family for disgracing them with both the affair and what they see as an immoral relationship. Her life is hanging in the balance because of your pursuing her and not being able to keep quiet about it.\n\nI\u2019m going to take another guess that you\u2019re in a place like India as opposed to a place like Syria because you\u2019re a woman living independently, so at least her life isn\u2019t in immediate danger via stoning. But that\u2019s hardly a consolation if a woman at 46 who has likely has limited work experience is suddenly going to be thrown out into the street if this gets out. The only silver lining to this could be that some ultra religious people can\u2019t comprehend how girl/girl intercourse can be a thing since there can\u2019t be penetration like there can be with straight and guy/guy relationships so they may be willing to turn the other way so long as she doesn\u2019t neglect her husband but that\u2019s really not the risk you want to take. \n\nYour best move now that you\u2019ve done this is to stop contributing to her infidelity and unrest, stop giving her something she cannot safely pursue, and for the love of all that is holy stop talking about it before she has to live with the consequences.",
