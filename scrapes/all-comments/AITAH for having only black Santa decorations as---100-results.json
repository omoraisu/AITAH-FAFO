      "selftext": "I had a few coworkers come over, also white people, that were very surprised to see my (few) Santa decorations I have in my house were all black Santa's. \n\nI've always preferred black Santa. I just think as a character design, it's more dynamic and better looking. \n\nHe's a fictional character... It's just the best look imo. \n\nThe basically said it was racist and weird of me to only have black Santa. \n\nI don't get it. \n\nIs that insensitive somehow? \n\nThe items were a few Santa face mugs, salt shaker, ornament, and hand towel. \n\nEverything is something you could have found in a Michaels or HomeGoods in the past 5 years. No weird racist vintage stuff. ",
