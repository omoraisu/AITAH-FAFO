Just recently however she started dating someone and posted him on IG. It was petty of me but I blocked him... In my eyes I don't know him so it shouldn't matter... I guess he noticed he couldn't see my comments and mentioned it to her so she messaged me asking about it. I told her that I didn't know him and didn't care to see him or for him to see me. She got upset and blocked me and hasn't spoken to me in a week... AITAH",
