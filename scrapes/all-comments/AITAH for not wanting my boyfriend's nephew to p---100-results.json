      "selftext": "I (24 F) have a 7 month son and we are living together with my (23 M) boyfriend. We rented the house together and both put equal amounts into the house with both our names on it and it's been amazing to actually have a house and for my baby to have his own room.\n\nAnyways my boyfriends parents like to invite them self's around sometimes and due to my anxiety I have made a boundary with my boyfriend that his family need to let me know if the would like to come over (it's the same with my own family) \n\nNormally my boyfriends mother has her grandson  that's 2 years old with her becasue her daughter and his dad both work and every time they are over the 2 year old rummages  in my bags and my sons things, he even tried to open some of the presents I had wrapped the night previously for ny family and shouted \"NO! NO! MINE! ALL MINE! GO AWAY!\" when I told him they went for him, even my boyfriends mom told him no and he went on a temper tantrum around my living room pulling all my sons toys out and throwing them.\n\nThe thing is this kid really like chocolate and my son has a milk allergy... this brat smeared his fingers over every surface he could making me have to wipe it all down and wash plastic toys... the worst part is after I cleaned  up I felt a bit ill so I took my sleeping son upstairs and lay down with him for a bit whilst my boyfriend entertained his family.\n\nAfter a while he came upstairs and asked if I was okay and I felt a little better, he told me he cleaned up and I was happy since he really doesn't do much unless I ask him to.\n\nHe brought my son down stairs and lay him in the carpet as he began to make him a bottle. As I came down stairs I saw my son holding something and was about to put it in his mouth... it was a half eaten bit of chocolate. Apparently my boyfriend gave his nephew some chocolate whilst I was up stairs... (after I had wipes everything down already)\n\nI dived and grabbed the chocolate out of my sons hands and wipes his hands and arms down and then began to hoover and look for more after I out my son in his high chair.\n\nAfter that I politely asked my boyfriend that his nephew doesn't eat chocolate in our house anymore and he agreed.\n\nFast forward to the other day, I had the day off work and went to spend time with family just to come home and find chocolate finger prints sneared on my sons new sitting pillow...\n\nThem saw some of the presents I had wrapped missing from under the tree and thrown around the room (still wrapped thank god)\n\nI was annoyed and asked my boyfriend about it and he just shrugged saying his nephew wanted to play whilst they were Iver that afternoon...\n\nI kinda lost it becasue he knows of my sons allergy and yet still gave a 2 year old chocolate, the same 2 year-old that likes to smear it everywhere...\n\nAnd that the presents weren't his to touch in the first place since I had payed for all of them\n\nI sighed and told him to forget it and I tool the cover off the pillow...(It was a right pain) and put it in a baby safe wash....\n\nAfter this I told him I don't want his nephew over anymore if he's not going to listen to a clear boundary I put in place to keep my son safe...\n\nHowever now he's acting like I'm the a hole because 'I'm being mean to a 2 year old'",
