      "selftext": "I (18f) moved out of my mom and her husband's house a couple of days after my birthday. It was something I heavily considered for a while but the push came because of the disagreements we had for years were getting worse and it was pointed out I lived in their home without paying the bills, etc. So I spoke to my grandparents and we agreed that it would be better for everyone if I lived with them. They came and helped me pack up my stuff, I took all my important documents and I left. My mom didn't believe it at first and tried to talk me out of it. She said I need to at least finish high school living with them but I said no.\n\nMy reason for moving out stems from the history with my mom since she remarried and her husband. My mom raised me mostly alone for 12 years. My dad died when I was only 7 months old. Even though I don't remember him and he was gone a long time I grew up with photos of him in our home and hearing stories and connecting with my family on his side. So I always felt a connection and I was always protective of he is my dad even if he died before I could remember him. Mom always said nothing could stop him being my dad. And that she believed he was looking over me.\n\nThings changed when she got remarried. It went from dad will always be my dad to hello, new dad for you here. Mom called him my new dad and he told me he couldn't wait to be my dad. I said I didn't want that. It led to fighting and he was hurt because \"you don't even know your dad and you have no memories of him so why reject me for someone you'll never know\". While mom told me I needed a dad. That she was sorry she hadn't seen it sooner. Dumb and weird stuff to ask a 12 year old was asked. Like who would walk me down the aisle if I didn't have a dad... my answer was mom but they acted like omg that's so dumb. Mom asked me who'd look after me if she died and I told her I had family. I also told her I wouldn't let him look after me if she died. That of course also hurt his feelings because he said I should stay with a parent over extended family. \n\nThen my name became an issue. They wanted me to change my last name to his. Mom actually put a petition in to change it in court but the judge let me keep my last name because I asked to. They also looked at having him adopt me but they were told my lack of consent would be the end of it. And I was very clear I did not want to be adopted by him.\n\nThey had us in therapy for 2.5 years. They would bring up my name a lot. That ended up being more of a fight than me not letting him be my new dad. They said I should be proud to have his name, that it was important to him, that it showed the world we were a family. It was tedious and never let up. The household became more unhappy until it reached the point of a heaviness staying over us. Sometimes I tried to ignore when they'd bring it up but they told me I was rude. My mom even tried to write my name as her husband's a few times and fucked some things up by doing that. She registered me for dance classes under her husband's name and when I had to bring in documents it became a huge ordeal. I didn't even wanna do dance but it was so embarrassing having my name become such a big deal.\n\nAnyway, sorry for the rant. Living with my grandparents has been SO good. But my mom and her husband want me \"home\" as they say, but I don't call it home. The house they live in never felt like home to me. And when my mom brought it up again a couple of days ago I told her I don't want to move back in and I never want to move back in. I said I would not be happy with them. She told me I belonged \"with my parents\" and she cried that I had left without even discussing it first. AITA?",
