      "selftext": "I (50F) am a newly divorced single mom who was left by my ex, after 27 years of marriage, after his mistress became pregnant.\n\nI have a 17 year old daughter and a 26 year old daughter. My 26 year old lives abroad.\n\nMy ex husband was physically and verbally abusive our entire marriage. The physical abuse began in earnest in our mid twenties and reached a peak in our early thirties.\n\nI only have a HS diploma. I originally wanted to go to college after marriage but my ex's abuse had me paralyzed to do anything he labeled as opposing/ undermining him and our family ( which included education and work).\n\nI tried to leave many times from around age 26 to 33 when the physical abuse was the worst but he'd find me. He'd alternate between gifts and apologies and threats. He also involved our bishop who sided with him.\n\nHe would go through our trash and once found a pamphlet for a community college program and the ensuing rage nearly landed me in the hospital. He'd call 5 times a day when he was at work and would often hit me if I missed a call accusing me of cheating or job hunting.\n\nMid 30s his physical abuse died down a bit but the verbal abuse and controlling fixation ( where he'd constantly be paranoid and call me a liar, sneaky, undermining) remained until our late forties when he began ignoring me completely. I was so broken down at that point that I was an emotional robot with I no interests, enjoyment of life, aspirations.\n\nThat's when he started calling me dumb, boring, empty. He even said he'd prefer a liar and underminer over what I was now and left me for his pregnant mistress who later called the cops on him for hitting her but declined to press charges.\n\nMy ex wasn't a big earner and spent a lot keeping up appearances so I got around $7,000 in the divorce.\n\nI understand many would be thankful for what I got. I got a job after 2 months making $14/hr but my boss said he can't schedule me full time- take it or leave it.\n\nBut I'm concerned about my retirement because all I want is to be able to retire in my seventies with consistent food and shelter since I'm already having health issues. So I asked my 17 yo who took a personal finance elective to help me read through some information I found online about retirement savings.\n\nThe other day my phone was dead and I needed to look something up so I used my daughter's phone. I found a group chat where my daughter was asking her friends who were in the class for advice and they were saying \" I don't know, sounds tough\" or saying I should apply for hospital jobs. She then wrote \" I know my mom is an example of what not to do but help please.\" She also aired laundry about how her new stepmother was like a mini version of me and doesn't understand why people like her dad \" get off\" on the fighting and his new wife opposing him which leads to him tearing her down and then making up with her. She also claims that I was thrown to the side by my ex because he got bored of me being what he wanted and a classmate said maybe her dad likes the fighting because he knows he'll win and feel like a champion.\n\nI just feel it was so disrespectful since I've told her about the abuse yet she doesn't understand the toll it takes on you. I didn't need her airing out my dirty laundry. Her response was she cut her dad off so she does understand and was trying to help. I took her phone for the afternoon saying maybe she'll think twice criticizing my choices to her friends. AITA?",

The only thing I can be thankful for is I didn\u2019t have kids so I was the only one that got hurt. Her daughter is 17 and can already spot the beginning stages of the abuse cycle. While there is a sadness to how she learned to recognize the pattern, it is a good thing she can see it from a mile away, it means she\u2019s less likely to be a victim herself in the future. If OP had any damn awareness she\u2019d see it that way too, unfortunately she\u2019s way too deep in her own feelings to be able to see it like that.</p>\n\n<p>OP if you see this, get yourself some therapy. Get your kid some therapy. And for the love of everything that is good, apologize to your daughter, return her phone and tell her that she should never hide abuse and never feel ashamed of someone else hurting her. Then go look in the mirror and tell yourself that too. Every day, until you believe it.</p>\n</div>",

We forget we by staying, inflict trauma in a whole other generation. \n\nWhat your daughter said were her true view, feelings and emotions and there is nothing wrong with her never wanting to be in that situation. Criticism by our children hurt but they are being honest with us. OP is definitely an a-hole for not seeing her daughter is trying to help her and never end up in a situation like OP which I would want the same for my child. \n\nOP asked her child, a 17 year old that is just starting off her life for help when she didn\u2019t get it together for so long and I\u2019m sorry about the abuse you endured by staying with him for so long but research can be done and an uncharged phone can be plugged. \n\nOP should get the therapy she needs and not use her children as therapy or counselors. The job market is tough but maybe it's time to go ti school. \n\nCurrently SEIU has some programs (California) which train people in the medical field ranging from\nmedical assisting to nursing.

We forget we by staying, inflict trauma in a whole other generation. </p>\n\n<p>What your daughter said were her true view, feelings and emotions and there is nothing wrong with her never wanting to be in that situation. Criticism by our children hurt but they are being honest with us. OP is definitely an a-hole for not seeing her daughter is trying to help her and never end up in a situation like OP which I would want the same for my child. </p>\n\n<p>OP asked her child, a 17 year old that is just starting off her life for help when she didn\u2019t get it together for so long and I\u2019m sorry about the abuse you endured by staying with him for so long but research can be done and an uncharged phone can be plugged. </p>\n\n<p>OP should get the therapy she needs and not use her children as therapy or counselors. The job market is tough but maybe it&#39;s time to go ti school. </p>\n\n<p>Currently SEIU has some programs (California) which train people in the medical field ranging from\nmedical assisting to nursing. Some are a direct connection to working with Kaiser and are great paying jobs. Not sure where OP is but it&#39;s never too late to go to school.</p>\n</div>",

My dad would fight back, her boyfriend would just walk away which is definitely the smarter way to handle it</p>\n</div>",

However talking about it shines a light on abuse and needs to happen. Good luck.</p>\n</div>",

OP wants her daughter to keep hiding the abuse, like she did for years and probably still does, keeping up apparences that they have / had a good/normal homelife, instead of being happy her daughter has support. And OP is punishing her daughter for speaking about her (the daughter&#39;s) own experiences. </p>\n\n<p>OP might be out of an abusive relationship with her daughter&#39;s father, but now she turned into a bully herself and she is now displaying abusive behaviour towards her daughter. Congratulations, her ex thought her well!</p>\n</div>",

But you need to understand that it negatively impacted your daughter as well and can have huge impacts on her mental AND physical health and you just punished her for having a support system because you don\u2019t think she should be allowed to talk about HER OWN experiences (because the absolutely did impact her too)?</p>\n</div>",

She struggled my whole life with binging behavior, oftentimes she\u2019d buy tons of food and I\u2019d get yelled at if I took some, she\u2019d feel bad about binging so she\u2019d scream at me, and it was a big circle. One time over the summer another kid confessed something about her mom to me so I told her about my mom. I told my mom when she picked me up because I was excited that I had someone to confide in. My mother went bonkers, screamed at me, and refused to talk to me for three days. It took me years to realize I was just a kid and I had no one to talk to about what I was going through and that keeping it a secret was wearing me down.</p>\n</div>",

He doesn't want an actual good relationship. You know all of this. But knowing and feeling aren't the same thing and you can feel two opposing things at once. \n\nYou are reading things into what your daughter wrote that she didn't say, but that are *your* worst fears. What if he was right about you? (He wasn't) What if your daughter also gets \"bored\" of you (she won't). What if she thinks just as badly of you as she thinks of her dad (she doesn't). What if she hates you for failing to protect her? (She doesn't). How shitty of a person you must be if you aren't even worth keeping around to abuse. (You are worth so much more. You deserve happiness and safety. You never deserve any of the abuse).\n\nNone of these things are things your daughter said, but they might be things you are feeling and you are reacting to *those* feelings. And that isn't fair to her. You need to apologise to her, without any ifs or buts. You can explain that you were overreacting because you have some deep seated fears and we're reacting from those, but you then need to follow up with saying that you know that was wrong. \n\nAlso, please see if therapy is available for you.

                "body": "Please for the sake of your daughter and yourself, get therapy. I grew up in an abusive household with a primary abuser (my mother who was also sometimes an enabler) and a primary enabler (my father. Who was also occasionally abusive to me and my brother and sometimes verbally abusive to my mother). It was hell. \n\nMy mom wasn\u2019t physical with us too often, but there was plenty of verbal and emotional abuse. Nearly everyday my parents would argue loudly, my mom would scream and curse, throw things. Sometimes my dad would just sit there in silence. She\u2019d slam doors. It was like stepping on eggshells around her. My dad often wouldn\u2019t intervene much if she was really letting me and my brother have it. Unless of course one of us started yelling back. \n\nI almost never brought friends over because of how much my parents fought. Of course they pretended everything was fine in front of others. In reality their marriage was a mess. My mom would frequently threaten divorce, which my dad would threaten back. Of course my dad never went through it and my mom wouldn\u2019t actually dare because she depended on him. I\u2019d have to listen to her rant about him. And him sometimes rant about her, but not as bad. As I got older I wished frequently that they\u2019d get a divorce. Everyday it was a question of what will set my mom off today? Will my dad actually do anything to help the situation? It was always the same loop. Fight. Make up. Fight again. Take her anger out on me and my brother. Dad stands by and doesn\u2019t do much. Make up. Fight. Over and over. \n\nMy dad kinda just seemed checked out and almost emotionless sometimes. In fact it felt like I barely knew him until he got cancer back in 2021. Me and my brother both became parentified and emotional sponges for them, but we couldn\u2019t really go to them for true emotional help. \n\nI remember when my mom told me to just go kill and cut myself during one of her screaming sessions (only a few months after I had actually attempted to kill myself). My dad was right there sitting at the computer. I know he heard her because he said something (I don\u2019t remember what but it wasn\u2019t very effective and he didn\u2019t bother saying anything else afterwards). When we were having a heart to heart once about some of the horrible things my mom had done and said to me he didn\u2019t even remember. He was so sure he would have said something more, but he didn\u2019t. \n\nDuring his cancer treatment I think it really hit him how much he enabled her and how much it fucked my childhood up. He regretted not leaving I think and I wish he would have. I wish he would have gotten therapy and I wish I wouldn\u2019t have gotten punished for pointing out or being taught to keep quiet about the abuse I witnessed and was experiencing. \n\nMy dad certainly wasn\u2019t perfect and resorted to abusive behavior himself. My dad taught me it\u2019s okay for someone to repeatedly cross your boundaries, it\u2019s okay to constantly fight with your partner, it\u2019s okay for them to throw things, punch things, curse you out, cheat on you, as long as you love them and for the kids sake you should stay. \n\nMy dad realized too late how royally messed up the situation was and even then I\u2019m still not sure he would have gotten therapy or divorced her. He\u2019s dead now. He died of cancer a few months ago. They were still arguing nearly up to the end. She was still being abusive towards me and my brother and still is though the good thing is we don\u2019t live with her anymore. \n\nMy dad wasted a good part of his life in a horribly toxic relationship. Both of his kids were trapped with him. He died in that relationship. You seem more concerned about the fact that your abusive ex husband left you for another woman than the fact that you and your daughter (who also suffered abuse) are finally free of him. \n\nI get it\u2019s hard to leave. I wish I could go no contact with my mom right now, but unfortunately I have a funeral I need to attend that she has control over and some of my dad\u2019s belongings. As much as it hurts and feels confusing right now, you are in a better position than you were before. Your ex husband is gone and that is a good thing. \n\nAbuse is often about power and control. Often they\u2019re looking for any wrong doing to start an argument. When my mom couldn\u2019t find anything to be upset about with me she\u2019d just move onto my brother or vise versa. There would be periods of time where I\u2019d give up and be very \u201cobedient,\u201d(put up with every abusive thing she did without any peep). So she\u2019d leave me alone for the most part. In fact I\u2019d practically be ignored sometimes. Then she\u2019d target someone else instead. It\u2019s like she couldn\u2019t not get into arguments. There couldn\u2019t not be drama. There had to be someone to blame for something. Your ex husband is probably similar. They don\u2019t actually want your obedience, they want someone they can push around and take their tantrums out on when the world doesn\u2019t revolve around them. It\u2019s time to take care of yourself and your daughter. \n\nFor half my life I grew up in silence thinking what was happening in my household was normal. Being able to vent to my friends in high school was one of the few things that kept me going for a while. Even then I still kept a lot inside. While I love my dad I\u2019m not sure I can forgive him for everything we were put through. There\u2019s a lot more I\u2019m leaving out. I wish I could have talked to him about my feelings in therapy and I wish he would had made an effort to go before his passing, but by his own words he was stubborn and didn\u2019t see a reason to change. Don\u2019t be like him please. \n\nGive your daughter back her phone and understand that this wasn\u2019t just your experience, but hers too. She wasn\u2019t being disrespectful. You are letting your insecurities get the best of you. Go to therapy and get her therapy. Try to build your relationship up with her rather than reminiscing about a relationship that was hurting you and her. \n\nYou can have a good life without him. He doesn\u2019t define your worth. He\u2019s a POS who doesn\u2019t deserve to be in your life. He doesn\u2019t deserve to be anywhere but a prison cell. Thinking of all the \u201creasons\u201d why he did these things or why he left isn\u2019t helpful, it\u2019ll just drive you up a wall and lead to a cycle of self blame. There isn\u2019t real reasoning to it except selfish ones. I hope you and your daughter get the help you need.",

She should be focused on enjoying her childhood while working towards her goals. Don't burden her with your bullshit. She shouldn't be worrying about you.\n\nSecond, this past that you've described isn't exclusively yours. It is her story too. She should be having conversations about her life situation with her support system. These friends are important to her and her well being. She wasn't being insulting but it would've been okay if she were disrespectful.\n\n\nIt is awful that you were with an abusive spouse. It has left you scared and wounded. There's no getting around how much damage has been done. \n\nYou can't get away from the fact that you made a bunch of bad choices. You could've completed your education before meeting your abusive husband and before you had a child at 23. You could've waited to have children until you'd established a career for yourself.

This was traumatic for her too and it sounds like she was seeking support from her friends - which she is allowed to do. She\u2019s allowed to have her feelings.

Teenagers talk to their friends about their parents because they are trying to sort out their place in the world and get an understanding of relationships.  While it feels like a betrayal, what she said was basically true, right?  (Her classmate talking about your husband \"being a champion\" was pretty on the nose, wasn't she?). I know it feels like a betrayal, but honestly -- would you want your daughter to follow in your footsteps?  This is why people on this subReddit often point out to victims of spousal abuse that walking away gives their children a good example of what NOT to put up with.  Does your daughter still have a relationship with her father?  She probably doesn't remember the active physical abuse stage of your marriage, and honestly, kids generally see their parents through a very weird lens.\n\nYou know the old saying \"eavesdroppers never hear anything good about themselves?\"  You were \"eavesdropping\" on your daughter's conversation.  I understand you're hurt by what she said but except for her interpretation of why you and your husband divorced, she sounds like she was trying to help and process how you got into the financial position that you find yourself.\n\nThe divorce settlement is scandalous.  After such a long marriage, it seems like some alimony should also be coming your way.\n\nHave a frank mother-daughter talk with your daughter, confess you read her group chat, and while you appreciate her help, you'd also appreciate it if she'd talk to you instead of speculating on why her father left.  She's old enough to understand spousal abuse, and while you may have hidden that from her to protect her relationship with her father, that doesn't mean he gets a free pass on how his actions have affected not only you but your family.",
