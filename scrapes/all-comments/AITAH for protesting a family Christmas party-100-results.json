      "selftext": "I have been low contact or no contact with most of my family(aunts, cousins and siblings) for about 1.5 yrs due to my mother telling me to end my life, berating my husband and verbally attacking me while I was at a low point and needed help. I was being asked to beg for her help and I said no. She cussed me out and blocked me and said she would never speak to me again. I told her siblings what happened and that needed help. They told me it didn\u2019t sound that bad and a personal issue because \u201cyour mom is always so sweet\u201d and I was dismissed. I shared the history of abuse I have had to keep a secret and then I was told I was being a bully and blocked. My sister has told me that our mother could murder a family member and she would still stand by her and support her because she is \u201cMom\u201d no other reason. Just a title. \n\nBefore the most recent comments from my sister telling me that my suicide attempt wasn\u2019t real, she forwarded an invite to the family Christmas party. I was blocked from getting it directly but it was forwarded by my mother. Now, I know I shouldn\u2019t go but I like to protest and have my voice or lack of voice heard. I have an elephant dress(so I can be the elephant in the room) and I will silently sit in a chair in the room and hold a sign on one side that says \u201cAbusers keep victims silenced for control\u201d and \u201cAbusers use fear to control enablers\u201d I will sit in silence for the full 3 hour party and leave. I have no desire to interact, just be the problem no one wants to face without being a problem. I have the text I was invited and if they ask me to leave, I will. I\u2019m not there to break laws, just make it weird. AITAH to do this? ",
