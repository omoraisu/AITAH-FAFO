      "selftext": "throw away account so no one sees..\n\nMy \\[24F\\] partner \\[24M\\] came to me this morning telling me that I was removed from the group discord server \\[ages 22-24\\] where we have mutual friends because I had done some wrong things, no one from the group spoke to me about my actions and sent my partner to confront me.\n\nwe decided together that the best course of actions are apologies to each member of the friend group \\[around 5 individualised apologies\\] and to get therapy for my actions to make sure I don't do it again...\n\nAm I overreacting because I feel this is all stupid and performative from this group? They have not spoken a word to me regarding this even though its been apparently going on for a while, and state its minor and 'repairable', and I am awaiting an itemised list of everything I did wrong so I can form my apologies better.\n\nAITA for feeling anger towards these people, as I feel they could have at least talked to me themselves, rather than a) sending my partner and b) not communicating with me when it happened\n\n  \nUPDATE:\n\nI received a list of what I did wrong and while I understand what I did was wrong \\[Talking a lot over others and dominating convo. Snapping back when they tried to help\\] I feel it definitely could have been solved at the time, rather than casting me out for space then making me grovel and apologise on their terms..\n\n",
