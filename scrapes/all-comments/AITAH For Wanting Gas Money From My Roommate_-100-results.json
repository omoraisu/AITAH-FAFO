      "selftext": "For context, we played softball in college together and have been best friends for 3 years. She offered me a job position at her job and I moved 5 hours from family and we became roomies! Okay so it\u2019s been about 2 months and we take my car everywhere, including to her family\u2019s place that takes about 2 hrs there and back. Her car is always in the shop so we kinda have to take mine. Now this job she knows I make less, and I know she makes double what I make, but I do get some help from family since I\u2019m also a full time college student. We usually always either go half or she pays then I pay (for food, drinks and stuff) , but she\u2019s never offered to help with gas\u2026 I\u2019m only saying that because this month I paid our electricity and she said she\u2019d pay me back on payday and didn\u2019t\u2026 so would I be an asshole to ask her for gas money, because we take my car literally everywhere? Might seem stupid, but I have pretty bad anxiety and overthink many things that shouldn\u2019t! So just wanted some help figuring it out :) ",
