      "selftext": "\\*TRIGGER WARNING\\* mentions of self harm and suicide. Me (14M), Mom(45\\~F), Dad (50\\~M), Brother (17M). Around 3-ish years ago I woke up from a nap and went into my dads office, just to see what he was doing. I was next to him when I looked down on his desk and saw a divorce paper. I of course was confused then broke down and my dad had the idea of going down to church and talk about it, but he didn't want to tell my mom because that would make things messy and we both weren't ready for that, so we tell her were going to get snack. Once we are at the church we had a talk and I asked a lot of questions like why and he asked\n\n\"you know how mom hasn't been around for awhile\" \n\nI reply yes and he tells me some excuse for why she was out for such a long time sorry I don't really remember what he said. Maybe a day or 2 later we were in the car and I asked him if mom was cheating because I was confused on why she would file for divorce for no reason and he says yes. He also tells me how he hired a private investigator to see what my mom was doing whilst she was away, turns out she was with her new boyfriend lets call him Brian this of course kind of shocked me and broke me. Over next few days I asked my dad about Brian and if he had a family, and of course he did. I also asked where they were going if he had a family and apparently they were going to a friends house. And I Also remember going to that house with my mom before she started disappearing, I also remember one of her friends being there lets call her Candle. And my dad goes on to tell me how Candle had a kid with a really rich guy then divorced him and got full custody so he had to pay child support.\n\n And as me and my dad got closer because of this we would go out and he would tell me some things like misery loves company and how he suspects Candle got mom into cheating. My mom would also always lie to us and tell us she was going to one of her friends house because a dog died or a friend needed help with something. And we all had to go along with the lies I also promised my dad I wouldn't tell my older brother.  My dad also asked me if I wanted to keep hearing about this stuff, I said yes but really didn't want to because it was destroying me on the inside and I was just hiding it. I also said yes because I thought it helped my dad because it gave him someone to talk about this stuff and listen. \n\nAlso forgot to mention this but Brian has 4 kids 2 older boys, and 2 girls one of the girls has down syndrome and is non verbal, (I don't know the ages of them) so when Brian and my mom were going to friends house he left his wife to deal with them on her own like my dad.\n\nThen my dad comes to me and says how he is about to call a family meeting and announce the divorce to me and my brother and told me to act like I didn't know anything. So my dad and mom sit me and my brother down and my mom tell us how they both wanted to get a divorce and so on.\n\nMonths after and my mom had moved out I started getting really depressed and started to cut my self, because I blamed my self a lot for the things my mom did, I even wrote notes on listing reasons on why I want to commit suicide, but like an idiot I left this note out and whilst I was a school my mom was cleaning the house and found this note and the same day me and my brother get called out of school. this was a shock to me and my brother and my dad takes us out to an art festival. After the festival my dad tells me that him and my mom were about to talk to me about the note my mom found, so we sit down and talk and I talk about how my mom disappearing for a year really sucked for me and mom was apologizing but I think that was because she only had to be sorry In the moment. My dad then goes on to tell me he is signing me up for therapy. \n\nLong story short I lied in therapy to make my dad look good, and got nothing from it. \n\nTimeline so far. Me finding out about the divorce: October-November, announcement of divorce: December, Mom moving into apartment: January, therapy: February. \n\nSkip to 6 to 5 months ago I was finally introduced to Brian my mom made me play drums for him and wanted me to let him play on my kit so I put my heart and soul into the fills I was playing to make him intimated to play and it worked, I don't want him touching my stuff especially my drums. But after this I went to my dads and he again gives me a heads up that he is gonna call me and my brother and talk to us about the private investigator stuff so now I don't need to hide it from my brother.\n\n(This time line is gonna get messy.) Fast forward a year and its again around Christmas time and I'm at my grandmothers on my mom's side playing pool and my grandpa got drunk and was telling me and my brother how strong my mom is and how good of a mother she is, this confirming my theory that my mom told her family that she was the good guy and that she sacrificed a lot of stuff for us. Now fast-forward to like 2 moths ago I went to go see the movie We Live In Time and my mom picked me up slightly drunk with her mom and a friend of hers both of them super drunk and I essentially have to babysit them and the friend tells me again how strong of women she is and how she's a great mom. These comments always crush me on the inside because they don't know the truth and I'm being told my moms great because she disappeared for a year. \n\nSo now my question is would I be the asshole for confronting my mom and telling my family about the truth or should I drop it because it was so long ago.",
