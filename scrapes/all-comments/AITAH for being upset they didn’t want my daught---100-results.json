      "selftext": "I (22f) had family pictures with my parents (52f & 59m), sister (26f), BIL (27m) and their 3 kids (7f, 2f and 9 week old m). I have a daughter (3f), we are both autistic. I knew my sister wasn\u2019t the biggest fan that I had a baby outside of marriage but I thought she\u2019d gotten over it. I was told by my family that they wanted me and my daughter, let\u2019s call her Camry, for family pictures. \n\nCamry and I rode in the same car as my parents to save space. When we got there, my sister and her family were taking pictures. We waited and then the photographer suggested having Camry in the pictures of just the kids, I was open to it but my sister said \u201cI just want my 3 right now.\u201d So we left it at that. Then they did my sister and her family with my parents, photographer suggested that Camry and I get in the pictures. My sister said \u201cI just want our family right now\u201d so Camry wanted to read a book they had on one of the sets, photographer said \u201cgo for it!\u201d \n\nMy niece who we\u2019ll call Liza (2f) wasn\u2019t cooperating and wandered over to where I was reading to Camry and sat with us. Photographer suggested we take whole family pictures on that set so everyone moved over and made Camry and I move. Camry sat next to Liza. My sister told Camry to move, when Camry looked at me confused, my sister picked her up and moved her. She moved her to where she couldn\u2019t be seen in the picture. I picked Camry up and put her in my lap, photographer got a few pictures before my sister noticed. She then said \u201cthat looks tacky move her or get out.\u201d \n\nThey instead moved to another set. They left no room for either of us. Then they wanted just grandkids with grandparents, when Camry went over for it, my sister grabbed her arm and removed her from the picture. Camry looked like she was about to cry. I got upset and walked outside with her, she started crying and I just hugged and held her. We stayed outside because why would you invite us and then not include us? \n\nShortly after my parents walked out and said it\u2019s time to go. My sister texted me and said \u201cyou didn\u2019t have to make a scene. It\u2019s not that serious. It was FAMILY pictures. I didn\u2019t know you were bringing her.\u201d I texted back \u201cyou\u2019re right it is FAMILY pictures, so why wouldn\u2019t I bring my DAUGHTER? I didn\u2019t know she wasn\u2019t invited. Sorry we ruined your perfect family pictures.\u201d \n\nI\u2019m being called an AH for \u201cmaking a scene\u201d. I didn\u2019t say anything in the moment and removed myself and my child from the situation. \n\nSo AITAH for being upset they didn\u2019t want my daughter in the family pictures?\n\n\nEDIT: my parents have apologized, they had no idea she was going to be like that. They have booked my daughter and I our own session with the photographer. We live with my parents and they help out a ton.",
