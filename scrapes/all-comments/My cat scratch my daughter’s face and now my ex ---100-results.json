      "selftext": "My husband and I have been separated for about a year and a half now. Our marriage is completely over since he slept with half the town, kicked me and our daughter out the house and we became homeless. There was no contact for about 8 months until I sued him for custody of our child. We settled for 48/52 since I needed help raising a child and I refuse to let my daughter grow up without a dad. I also got child support and currently trying to get alimony. My daughter and I are 100% happy and doing better than great. Got a house, a life, a great job. But her father and I don\u2019t communicate. I don\u2019t care about his life, as we both moved on but when it comes to our daughter I would like communication. I do understand that when my daughter is at his house, it\u2019s his rules. But for some reason he doesn\u2019t understand that it\u2019s my house my rules. For example that recently happened today. My daughter got scratched by my cat. I did let him know that it\u2019s a learning process for both the cat and my daughter, who is 2, that they need to be civil. Majority of the time, Both my daughter and cat play, cuddle, everything is nice. But sometime as a toddler she\u2019s absolutely CRAZY. she\u2019s loud, she hits, she\u2019s fast, she dances and dead weights her body onto the cat for a hug. They been together since my daughter was born and this cat is about 5 years old, she\u2019s gotten used to my daughter but sometimes sh!t happens. I do get upset at her and teach her that we need to be calm and have nice hands or the cat will scratch you. Which, she did get a scratch on her nose. My daughter laughed it off and continued her day and I took it as a learning opportunity. Day goes on and now her dad is yelling at me for allowing her to be near the cat. And he tells me that at his house he has two cats and his other two kids and our daughter are not allowed near the cats because of similar issues like this one. He\u2019s making me feel like a bad parent for allowing our daughter to near her cat and getting scratched asking if I ever watch her.  He never communicates over important issues and when he does it\u2019s always an augment. I don\u2019t condone it, I don\u2019t wanna play his games so I left him on read. Mainly because what I\u2019ll say won\u2019t matter to him. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong about the cat. But I feel like my child should have a pet and not to be hidden. AITAH. ",
