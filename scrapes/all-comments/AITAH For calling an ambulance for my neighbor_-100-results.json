      "selftext": "For content I (F30) am watching my dad\u2019s dog this weekend (a medium sized rescue) and my neighbor (M60s?) has a large retriever of some kind that he is unable to control. Beautiful dog but this dog has no training and is constantly roaming the grounds. \n\nSo yesterday morning I go to take my pup out (we\u2019ll call him Milo) and all of the sudden I see my neighbors dog running full sprint at me and Milo. My first reaction is to grab Milo and to protect him because I have no idea what this dog is going to do. As I\u2019m holding Milo it seems like the dog isn\u2019t aggressive so I turn around to see if my neighbor is out to get him and then I see he is unconscious on the ground. From what I can gather he took his dog out shortly after I did and since his dog has no training and he can\u2019t control him he took off after Milo knocked him down and he hit his head. (It\u2019s about 20\u00b0 F here in the morning and the ground is hard from being frozen) I throw Milo inside call for my boyfriend to come outside and call 911 and run over to make sure he\u2019s still breathing. He is. My boyfriend calls 911 and comes outside with me to wait. \nMy neighbor is unconscious for a GOOD 5+ minutes. When he starts to come to he is dazed and clearly doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. It takes him an another couple minutes to figure it out. My boyfriend and I explain what happened and that he was unconscious hit his head and help is on the way. \nWell he didn\u2019t like this. \nHe stands up and immediately falls over again. We run over to help and try to get him to stay on the ground so he doesn\u2019t hit his head again. This is where things go sideways. He stands up again wobbling and backs himself against his unit and turn\u2019s aggressive. Tells us to back the fuck off. He didn\u2019t ask for our help and he doesn\u2019t want our help. We obviously don\u2019t want an altercation so we put up or hands apologize and just say we didn\u2019t want to leave him unconscious in the cold and walk away. He goes inside and so do we. \nShortly after the ambulance fire department and police show up. \nI got outside and explain everything that happened and point out his unit. They thank me and say they\u2019ll take it from here. \nThey do eventually get inside. It took awhile for him to open the door and apparently he was so disoriented he did end up going to the hospital. \nI know medical bills are expensive but I just couldn\u2019t leave someone unconscious outside in the freezing cold. But he was definitely pissed I called 911. My boyfriend says I did the right thing but now I\u2019m concerned my neighbor is going to hold a grudge against me. So AITAH?\n\nEDIT: Small update. My neighbor just came over to talk to me. He just got home from spending the night in the hospital and he apologized for being aggressive and thanked me for calling 911. He has a severe concussion. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s ok and I\u2019m glad this came to a peaceful resolution. ",
