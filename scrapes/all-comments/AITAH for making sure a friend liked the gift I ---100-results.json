      "selftext": "So I was at a friends house for his birthday party and about an hour in he began opening his presents. After he opened a couple I pointed to the gift I got him (it was a wreath, the guy at the store told me he had the same one and it works great) and I let him now that there was a gift receipt in case he didn\u2019t want it. He was super short with his response and just said \u201ccool thanks\u201d so I was curious if he really even liked it. I asked him if he did like it and he said he really liked it. So I thought that he wouldn\u2019t need the gift receipt and asked him to give the receipt back to me since he did like the gift. That\u2019s where things took a turn.\n\nAfter I asked for the gift receipt it got super awkward and he tried to change the subject by starting to open another present but I just couldn\u2019t get it off my mind. So I addressed the fact that he said he loved the gift and I said if he did love it so much then it wouldn\u2019t be an issue if I took the receipt back. He got frustrated and finally gave me the receipt back which shouldn\u2019t have been an issue anyway. I didn\u2019t know if he gave me the receipt because he was annoyed or because he really did like the gift so I asked him if it would be fine if I ate the receipt to really prove that he didn\u2019t want to return my gift. He hesitated but eventually said I could eat it. This was a huge mistake on my part.\n\nI ate the gift receipt and could immediately feel my stomach churning. I knew before gifts he had went to the bathroom to do a mud pie and he must have used too small of a slice of toilet paper when he wiped. So he likely had mud pie on his hands, touched the receipt a bunch, then I ate it and got sick. After I accused him of this the party got out of control. Another friend of ours offered to eat a receipt that Jacob (the birthday boy) hadn\u2019t touched to see if it was his mud pie or just the paper that made me sick. She ate the receipt and ended up being perfectly fine, which proved that I was right and Jacob did use too small of a slice of toilet paper. After this the party began questioning if Jacob liked any of our gifts and we all decided to leave his house. As everyone left I reminded him that all he had to do was like my gift. He was being a major dick so I told him that nobody even likes his house anyways and that his wife kissed me on the cheek when I got there. Before I walked out of the door I said everyone is gonna go party at my house and that now he\u2019s all alone. I also gave him one last \u201chappy birthday\u201d and I walked out.\n\nAITAH?",
