      "selftext": "I\u2019m (24, F) graduating with my degree in art soon, and while I\u2019m excited, I\u2019m also dealing with some tension with my parents. They\u2019ve always been adamant that I pursue a \u201creal\u201d career like business or medicine. I\u2019ve known since high school that art was my passion, and despite their disapproval, I stuck with it. I put in countless late nights, worked part-time jobs to cover tuition, and stayed committed to my dream. My parents never really acknowledged my effort; instead, they\u2019d say things like, \u201cWhen are you going to realize this is just a hobby?\u201d or \u201cDo you really expect to make money from this?\u201d\n\nIt all came to a head a few months ago when I got my first big internship with a well-known gallery. I was so proud and thought it would be a turning point for them, but when I told them, they just shrugged and said, \u201cThat\u2019s nice, but don\u2019t get your hopes up.\u201d\n\nFast forward to now \u2014 my graduation is around the corner, and I\u2019m excited to celebrate with friends and my little brother. I decided to send my parents an invitation, but they never responded. So, I finally called them and said, \u201cAre you planning to come?\u201d They were surprised and said they weren\u2019t sure if they could make it. When I asked why, they told me they didn\u2019t think a graduation in art was something worth celebrating. They implied they\u2019d rather not be there than support my \u201cunrealistic\u201d path.\n\nI was hurt, but then I got mad. I told them I didn\u2019t want them to come at all if they didn\u2019t actually want to be there. I said I wanted to surround myself with people who believed in me and were proud of me, not people who\u2019ve spent years making me feel like my choice was a mistake. They said I was being dramatic and that it wasn\u2019t a big deal, but now they\u2019re upset and claiming I\u2019m making them feel unwelcome.\n\nI feel conflicted. I know they\u2019re my parents, and they\u2019ve done a lot for me, but I can\u2019t ignore the fact that they\u2019ve never supported my passion. It hurts that they can\u2019t see my graduation as a moment of achievement, regardless of my career choice. I\u2019ve talked to friends who say I have every right to feel this way, but some say I\u2019m overreacting and should let them be a part of this milestone.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for refusing to let my parents come to my graduation because they never supported my career choice?",
