      "selftext": "AITA for distancing myself from my best friend? \n\nsorry if this is jumbled and long, my thoughts on this arent straight yet, and this is also my first post.\n\nso i (16f) have a best friend, G (16), who ive known for 10 years. in our 10 years of friendship, we have had our struggles, but we have always been able to work them out.\n\nrecently, i left my brick-and-mortar school to do online, while G has stayed at my old school. G has another friend, K, who joined my old school after i left. ive met K before, but they havent been very good times. the first time, G poured water all over me to make K laugh. its a pattern i have noticed: G will meet someone new, and will turn me into the butt of every joke to impress them(?). G moved to another town in May, meaning it became more difficult for me to see her (my mom works 2 jobs and my dad is disabled). although ive tried many times, the plans we make fall through. but on the days that we were supposed to hang out, i end up finding out that G is with K. \n\nin around august/september, things got very hard for me. im in all honors classes this year + precal + AP Lit Comp, as well as having to deal with losses in my family in such close times together. during this time, G made no effort to reach out. i texted her and told her that i did want to see her, but she then blew up at me stating \"i wake up at 6 for school, go to college from 1 to 4, and then go to work until 10. i feel like everyone just expects me to drop everything to talk to them.\" for a little more context, she does cosmetology for her college course. i told her i didnt expect that, but at the same time, i didnt understand how she could make time for everyone but me. she also began completely ignoring me. for hours she would leave me on delivered, while changing her notes on instagram (you literally have to go to dms to change your note, which made me know this was intentional.) she would also make tiktoks about how bad of a friend i was for not seeing her side, but i do. G has a problem with not communicating, and instead throwing subtle shade through what she posts, but yet she preaches communication. her biggest ick in her last relationship was that her ex didnt communicate, but what she doesnt realize is that she is the exact same way.\n\nin october, she finally started talking to me again, but it wasnt the same. she is colder now and our bond isnt the same. she still calls me to talk about her boy struggles and her work problems, but never really asks about me. i havent heard a \"how are you?\" from her in such a long time. now, ive started leaving her on delivered and opened, and not responding to her calls. she hasnt received it well though, and is taking offense to it. its annoying to me how she has these double standards, but it seems to me that she doesnt recognize that the double standards are there.\n\ni dont want to not be friends with her, because she practically knows everything about me starting from 1st grade. i just wished she saw my side of things and its making me want to pull away.\n\nAITA?",

It's important to remember that u deserve someone who values ur time and effort just as much as u value theirs. Communication is key and if u tried to express how u feel and there's no change, it might be healthier for u to step back. It can be hard but taking care of urself should be ur top priority.",
