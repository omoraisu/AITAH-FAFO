      "selftext": "\n[Original Post](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/9EJWriAVzl)\n\n(I wrote this post on Thursday I just didn\u2019t get chance to post it until now)\n\nSo Henry and Erin actually took me to McDonald\u2019s after school today (the day I am writing this) and they said to me they could tell I was upset with them and asked me to explain my feelings to them. I explained how I felt really frustrated that they told me the parental controls were because they bought the phone and then when my dad bought me a phone they still put the same restrictions. They said they were sorry they gave that impression and that they could have explained it better. \n\nThey asked which were the restrictions I had the biggest issue with; I said how I can\u2019t text/call anyone unless they approve it, how the phone locks at 8pm, I can\u2019t use it, and that I only have a 30 min on YouTube or TikTok and that I can\u2019t have apps like Snapchat, discord, instagram etc. They said okay, they understood why I was upset and frustrated and said they will discuss with my social worker how they can lighten up the rules while still ensuring I am safe. They said they don\u2019t want me having a long time on the phone because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for me, but they said in the meantime they will increase the limit to 1 hour for YT/TT and that they will increase the bedtime until 9:30pm. I think this is a fair compromise. \n\nI said they seemed upset that I got a new phone in general, and they said they weren\u2019t upset at me but were upset at the situation. I asked what they meant, and they said that it was something between them and my dad and I didn\u2019t need to worry about it. But I asked them to carry on and I had to kind of persuade them to tell me. They had actually bought a iPhone 16 pro max for Xmas for me and had told my parents and my social worker that they had bought it and were going to give it me for Xmas. But my dad bought one before they could give me theirs and they felt upset that their big present had been ruined. But they said that wasn\u2019t my fault and they didn\u2019t mean to make me feel like they didn\u2019t care about what my dad got me. \n\nHonestly that made me feel upset, I asked my dad why he bought me the phone if he knew that Henry and Erin already did. He said he didn\u2019t want Henry and Erin to have to give me something so expensive. But I said they had already bought it for me and he knew that. I said that was unfair and that he shouldn\u2019t have done that. He called me ungrateful. I asked him how he would have felt if it was the other way around and he left me on read :/\n\nI actually feel really upset for Henry and Erin that my dad did that to them and I actually feel guilty even though I didn\u2019t know they had already bought me one. I\u2019m not sure what to do now, I could give my phone back to my dad and have Henry and Erin\u2019s but idk if that\u2019s the right thing to do. Henry and Erin said that it wasn\u2019t my fault and that it doesn\u2019t mean my dad is a bad person, which I know. But I do feel really angry at him.\n",

I commend you for being able to articulate to your foster parents why you were upset and the concerns that you had with the parental controls. \n\nIt sounds like you have a great relationship with your foster parents as they also felt comfortable articulating their concerns and sadness to you. All around, this sounds like you\u2019re in a really great and supportive situation.\n\nRegarding your father, unfortunately many of the commenters on your previous post were correct. I\u2019m sorry that he left you on read and would not entertain a conversation about the situation. He likely feels caught (because he is!). You will need to me mindful of his attempts of manipulation in the future. \n\nThis is something that you are going to learn about your biological parents. As is with human nature, people react to things differently (and sometimes not as well as they should). Your father obviously feels like your step parents are taking majority responsibility for raising you and are able to receive your love and gratitude. It\u2019s natural that he feels that way, as he is not your caregiver, however the way that he is going about that relationship with you is going to cause further friction. \n\nI wish you all the luck in navigating the situation, especially as you graduate high school and move to college or other opportunities.",
