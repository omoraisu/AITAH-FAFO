      "selftext": "So a couple days ago, I made plans to hang out with a friend of mine. We are in college and live in separate states and this is also my last year in college so I will not be seeing her after this year. We made plans for her to come over this coming weekend on Saturday so we can celebrate her birthday a bit early and to hang out before winter break. \n\nA couple days prior to setting up this hang out my boyfriend and I made plans to go to his sister\u2019s play (a musical she\u2019s in) on that Friday. Today he told me that his family will have to come Saturday night instead of Friday night because his little brother works Friday night.\n\nI told him I had already made plans to go hang out with my friend so I will most likely not be able to go to the play. He said this play was important to him and I told him I understood that but my friends are also important to me.\n\nAITAH?",
