      "selftext": "So my boyfriend and I live together a few yrs and before we moved in together I was working making 100k salary but i got burnt out and decided to leave my job of 10 years to focus on my mental health. \n\nThat being said, I saved up over 300k within that time frame not including my retirement accounts. Also before I left my job I started an e-commerce business that I\u2019ve been growing (I\u2019ll probably make around 60k this yr from it) \n\nMy boyfriend has always had money trouble and he has little savings due to being unemployed for a while and working on paying debts and other financial goals of his. He makes about 70k right now which is the most he has made. Once he got his promotion and my business started making 5k monthly consistently I decided to leave my job. About 4k if that is profit, plus I make about 1k - 2k monthly investing and doing other random things like bank offers and Instacart. \n\nMy boyfriend works 40hr weeks with random shift times and commutes 30 minutes. Most of the time he is exhausted when he gets home because his job can be physically demanding. \n\nBefore I quit my job we were always 50/50 on chores and I assumed it would stay that way since I\u2019m still contributing financially and I focus on my online shop 2-3 hrs a day. I try to spend a good amount of time outside socializing, exercising, etc. and I\u2019m doing most household errands like shopping and paying bills with our joint accounts etc. \n\nHe is starting to get really upset that I haven\u2019t picked up more chores like cleaning and doing our both of our laundry since he is \u201cthe one with the job\u201d now and I\u2019m unemployed. I tried to correct him and told him I\u2019m working too but just not a traditional job and I\u2019m still bringing in almost as much as he does, if not more. \n\nHe says I\u2019m selfish and that it isn\u2019t about money, it\u2019s about time. Since I have more free time I need to start doing more and so I told him if he wants me to do more than we shouldn\u2019t split bills equally anymore. Maybe 60/40\n\nHe got even more angry that I suggested that because I have more than him financially saved and he has a car payment he pays alone (I drive an old paid off car so no payment). \n\nI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m being AH here or if it\u2019s fair what I\u2019m saying because I\u2019m still doing an equal financial contribution? Should i be doing more than 50/50 house chores? ",
