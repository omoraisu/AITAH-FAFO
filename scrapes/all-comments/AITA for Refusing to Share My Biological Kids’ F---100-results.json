      "selftext": "I (42M) have two biological children, Anna (16F) and Jake (14M), from my first marriage. When their mother passed away, she left them a substantial inheritance, which I\u2019ve carefully managed in trust funds for their future education and other needs. My late wife and I always prioritized their future, and this money is meant to support their goals, whether that\u2019s college, starting a business, or something else they dream of.\n\nA few years ago, I married my current wife (39F), who has two kids from her previous marriage, Ethan (15M) and Sophie (12F). I love my stepchildren and treat them with the same care and respect as my own, but their father is still in their lives and provides financial support. While I contribute to their day-to-day needs, my wife and I never discussed blending the finances meant specifically for Anna and Jake.\n\nRecently, my wife brought up the idea of using some of Anna and Jake\u2019s trust funds to help with Ethan and Sophie\u2019s upcoming expenses, such as extracurricular activities and potential college savings. She argued that it\u2019s unfair for my biological kids to have such a financial advantage while her children don\u2019t. She believes that as a family, we should pool resources equally for all the kids.\n\nI told her that I couldn\u2019t do that. The trust funds were set up solely for Anna and Jake, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to take money from them that their late mother intended for their future. I offered to work with her to find other ways to save for Ethan and Sophie, but she was upset, accusing me of playing favorites and not fully accepting her kids as part of the family.\n\nThe argument escalated when her parents got involved, suggesting I was being selfish and that it\u2019s my responsibility to treat all the children equally. Now, even Anna and Jake are aware of the situation and feel awkward, worrying that they\u2019re being resented by their stepfamily.\n\nI feel torn because I love my stepkids and want them to succeed, but I also want to honor the intentions behind the money their mother left for them. So, AITA for refusing to share my biological kids\u2019 funds with my stepchildren?\n",

Especially not when they get into the adult world. They are teens. Time for them and your wife to learn that lesson that should have already been learned. \n\nThe fact that step kids have 2 living parents providing financial support on top of a 3rd/step dad taking care of their day to day expenses, which would allow more leeway for your wife and her ex to save than your late wife did, and they\u2019re still to poor to provide the same funding for their children, speaks volumes about her greed. \n\nHow the hell can there be 3 income streams supporting the step kids with you paying their daily living, and she still needs your kids trust fund to pay for her kids extracurriculars? Where the hell is all of her money plus child support going if her bills are paid by you that she needs a someone else\u2019s trust to dip into?",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA. Everyone else made points about the legality and morality of the trust and the money itself. I\u2019d like to point out it\u2019s also not fair that step kids get 3 parents and have never experienced the death of a parent. Life isn\u2019t fair. Nothing is 100% equal for anyone in life. Especially not when they get into the adult world. They are teens. Time for them and your wife to learn that lesson that should have already been learned. </p>\n\n<p>The fact that step kids have 2 living parents providing financial support on top of a 3rd/step dad taking care of their day to day expenses, which would allow more leeway for your wife and her ex to save than your late wife did, and they\u2019re still to poor to provide the same funding for their children, speaks volumes about her greed. </p>\n\n<p>How the hell can there be 3 income streams supporting the step kids with you paying their daily living, and she still needs your kids trust fund to pay for her kids extracurriculars? Where the hell is all of her money plus child support going if her bills are paid by you that she needs a someone else\u2019s trust to dip into?</p>\n</div>",
