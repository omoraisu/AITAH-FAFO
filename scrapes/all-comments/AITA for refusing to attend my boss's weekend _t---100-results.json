      "selftext": "I (28F) work for a mid-sized company, and my boss, \u201cLaura\u201d (40sF), is obsessed with \"team-building activities.\" Once a month, she organizes mandatory weekend retreats at her vacation home, about two hours away from the office. These retreats are unpaid, and while they\u2019re framed as \u201cfun bonding time,\u201d they\u2019re basically just long work meetings mixed with awkward icebreakers and forced socializing.\n\nFor context, I\u2019m already working 50+ hours a week, and weekends are my only time to rest and take care of personal stuff. I also have a dog that I\u2019d need to arrange care for every time, which adds to the hassle. I\u2019ve gone to two retreats before, and they were exhausting. Laura expects everyone to wake up early, participate in every activity, and stay up late drinking and \u201cnetworking.\u201d It\u2019s just not my idea of fun, and I\u2019d rather not spend my personal time that way.\n\nLast month, I decided I wasn\u2019t going to go anymore. When Laura announced the next retreat, I politely declined and said I had personal plans that weekend. She looked annoyed but didn\u2019t say much. However, after the retreat, she called me into her office and said my refusal to attend showed a \u201clack of team spirit\u201d and that it could hurt my chances for promotions or raises in the future. I explained that I need my weekends for personal time, but she brushed it off, saying, \u201cWe all make sacrifices for the team.\u201d\n\nSince then, she\u2019s been cold toward me, and I\u2019ve heard from coworkers that she\u2019s been making passive-aggressive comments about how \u201csome people aren\u2019t committed to the team.\u201d A couple of coworkers have told me they support my decision, but others think I\u2019m being selfish and not thinking about how it looks to the rest of the group.\n\nI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair for her to expect us to give up our personal time for free, but now I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m being difficult or ungrateful. AITA for refusing to attend the retreats?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
