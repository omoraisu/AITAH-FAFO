      "selftext": "AITAH.....\n\nI have a good friend of mine who suffers heavily from depression and all the things related to that (I also suffer from all the same things), he has been really down recently and I have been trying to help and support him as best as I can. A bit of context here, I have recently come back from a holiday and have also met someone in my life causing me to feel good and happy and finally feeling like things are going my way, he got really jealous of the fact I had (finally) found someone which caused him to spiral, he spoke to another friend of his and was invited to a music festival with them to help him out and I encouraged him to go, he ended up doing festival activities (use your imagination here) and then had the obvious come down from it. I got up to go to work Monday morning and noticed he hadn't left for work yet so I needed him to move his car so I could get out, he told me he wasn't doing good at all with his mental health and felt like self inflicting again so I called and told boss I wasn't going to be in at work because I had an emergency I needed to help sort out. I get my friend to talk to the right people on the phone to try get him help, he does take the calls and gets a couple things sorted out. After that I double check that he wasn't going to have a spicy Lettuce smoke for the rest of the day as we both smoke and he ensures me he won't, I do my best to help him during the day and distract him by watching a movie that we both wanted to watch, once the movie finished he said he was going to go have a nap and I hear him then go outside and have a smoke.\n\nWhat I want to know is AITAH for now thinking to myself that I can't keep helping him and hindering my mental health when he doesn't help me anywhere near as much even when I really need it. I want to tell him that I can't keep doing that anymore but I wanted some advice and to see what other people think of the situation before I say something. \n\nHe might see this post as he is a constant user of reddit so I won't keep this up for very long.
