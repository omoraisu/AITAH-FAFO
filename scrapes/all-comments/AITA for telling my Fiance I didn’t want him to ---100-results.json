      "selftext": "I (31f) and my fiance (34m) have been together for a year and a half, engaged for 6 months. I have a daughter (14f), he has no kids and we don\u2019t plan on having any together. We agreed very early on in our relationship on our compromises and non-negotiables. He refuses to leave our area and his family who he has always lived near, he literally bought his grandmas house right down the street from his mom and sister. I love and respect his dedication to his family and I didn\u2019t want to be in the way of that. \nSo, we decided we would stay here and prioritize visiting my family and our time with them when they visited us. I grew up moving a lot and in/near big cities. I moved to where we are now (very rural) to take care of my grandparents until they ultimately passed and planned on leaving. The country was not somewhere I ever wanted to settle down. But I love him and I felt this was a fair compromise. I love our life and the father role he has taken with my daughter. He calls her his daughter and he has been truly wonderful with her and she loves him. \nNow, this weekend my daughter was in her schools musical and my dad, his wife, my mom and her husband drove in from where they live to see it. My mom\u2019s drive is a 20 hour drive round trip. This has been the plan for months, since the dates were announced. Last week, his nephew tells him he\u2019s stepped in to a role for a Christmas play last minute to play Jesus and asked him to come. He said yes. Originally, I didn\u2019t say anything because I thought ok, we\u2019ll just spend the morning and afternoon with my mom (dad has already left) before the play Sunday, then he\u2019ll go to the nephews play and I\u2019ll stay with my mom for my daughters last show and hang out with them after. Annoyed, but ultimately I decided to pick my battles.\nThen this morning, he tells me he has to go to his moms to bring in her dog food for her. They have no food left and he has to go asap. (He always does this, she buys the huge bags but can\u2019t carry them in because of her knees)\nSorry more context- he sold his home and moved in with me, about 30 minutes from family farm.\nI\u2019m frustrated because he\u2019s known this since Saturday and didn\u2019t tell me, and he didn\u2019t think about how that would affect time with my mom today. He slept in, and when it was time to go he\u2019s just like \u201cope nevermind, gonna spend the day up there instead\u201d. Had he told me, I would have suggested he wake up earlier to go do that so we could still spend the day with my mom before he left for the play. \nSo, I ask him to of course feed the starving dogs, but come back and spend the evening with us before my mom leaves. He says no, I told my nephew I\u2019d go so I\u2019m going. I remind him that this is extremely important to me, we see my mom a handful of times a year or less and we see his family several times a week. The kid is 15, doesn\u2019t actually care about the play he\u2019s just a last minute stand in for his friend. We start arguing and we both leave very angry with each other. Both said things we shouldn\u2019t have and we\u2019ve never gotten in a fight like this before. \nQuick facts- \nSister and nephew were driving from a night away and wouldn\u2019t be there until later in the afternoon so they couldn\u2019t take care of the dogs.\nThis is not the first time my family has been here and he\u2019s gone and spent practically a whole day with his instead \nHis mom and sister are wonderful and I am positive they would understand if he explained\n\nThis was a compromise that we agreed to and I made very clear was a hard line for me from the beginning. I feel like he is breaking his word with me and it hurts me deeply. Now I\u2019m questioning everything. Then at the same time, he sold his family home to be with me. We couldn\u2019t live there because my grandfather is disabled, plus my home is just newer and a higher value. His was very old and costing more than it was worth tbh. And then I question if I\u2019m being dramatic and overthinking. I don\u2019t know. AITA?",

        "body": "NTA. I get the impression you want to make sure you aren\u2019t crazy before you have a more in depth convo about this.  Well, my dear, you are not crazy. \n\nI have a feeling he thinks this is all because he wanted to go to a play for his nephew - and how dare you deny him right to support him.  He absolutely does not get that it\u2019s a much bigger issue than that and it has deep roots that stretch beyond this situation. Some things to touch on when you talk again:\n\n1. This is becoming a pattern. He repeatedly has bailed on your family, which is something that is extremely important it is to you. He *should* be well aware of that, but for whatever reason, he doesn\u2019t seem to care. \n\n2. Although you understand that him going to his nephew\u2019s play isn\u2019t prohibiting YOU from spending time with your family, that was NOT the deal the two of you made. The deal was for BOTH of you to prioritize the limited time you have with your family, NOT just you. \n\n3. This isn\u2019t just about him going to the play. You understand it\u2019s an extenuating circumstance and would have been cool with it regardless.  However, it\u2019s the fact he didn\u2019t consult with you before agreeing to go, DESPITE TECHNICALLY ALREADY HAVING PLANS WITH YOU, and he blew off the entire last day you had with your mom (as well as your feelings). The moment he did that, he basically showed you that he doesn\u2019t consider your family a priority, and by extension, he doesn\u2019t give a shit about your wants/feelings a priority either. \n\n4. It might be different if he was tied up with work, or something happened out of his control. But no. He\u2019s blown you and your fam off just to spend time with his family (who he sees all the time), and to do mundane things. That says a lot about where he ranks your family. \n\n5.  This isn\u2019t really about spending time with your family as much as it\u2019s about respecting your feelings and you in general. You\u2019ve made it clear your family is a priority to you.  You have made his family a priority because you respect that it\u2019s very important to him. You expect him to do the same. Except instead of giving a shit, he has chosen to willfully ignore, and disregard your feelings, along with the arrangement you BOTH decided on. \n\nOne more thing - you are not totally faultless here either. You need to be aware of that before talking to him, and be willing to take accountability.  You were annoyed, but *didn\u2019t say anything*. You \u201cthought to yourself\u201d and *assumed* he would spend the day with your mom before and after his nephew\u2019s play.  \n\nI get you were picking your battles, which isn\u2019t a bad thing. I agree that not making a fuss about him going to support his nephew was not a bad way to go. But you still should have said something along the lines of, \u201cI wish you had spoken to me before agreeing to go nephew\u2019s play since we had already committed to hang out with my family, but if it\u2019s important to him, then go. But next time, can we please talk about plans changing *BEFORE* you decide on your own?\u201d (This points out that he SHOULD have realized he already had plans\u2026but he didn\u2019t\u2026and you\u2019re graciously letting him off easy). \n\nIt also wouldn\u2019t have been a bad idea to make sure he knew what you expected of him. Like, being around for the rest of your mom\u2019s visit (for example) - and then coordinated plans with him, rather than assuming what he was gonna do.  Like saying: \u201cAlthough you\u2019re going to the play, you\u2019re still going to be around in the morning before it, and come back after, right?\u201d as soon as he told you about the play. \n\nYes, he should have realized it was a shitty thing to do, and not done it on his own. Especially since you guys have explicitly talked about it.  But. You guys also have only been together for a year and some change.  It\u2019s a learning curve and some reminders will be necessary.  However, with that said, it\u2019s still unacceptable that he essentially agreed to plans with your family (and you) and then blew them off to do fuck all. He is treating the time with your family as an optional thing instead of the priority (and the solid commitment) it *should be*. \n\nLast little tidbit - perhaps apologize for saying the kid is 15 and doesn\u2019t give a shit about his play. He did call your fianc\u00e9 to invite him, so I would argue he does, in fact, give a shit about it. It\u2019s a small thing, but might stand out. \n\nYou need to sit down with him and calmly explain all of the above. I\u2019m willing to bet that based on the fact HE sees this as optional vs. a commitment he made, that he doesn\u2019t have a clue why you\u2019re mad and legitimately thinks you\u2019re making a mountain out of a mole hill.  Since he is acting like he\u2019s really fucking dense - treat him like it.  Perhaps write him a letter outlining everything so he has time to read it, process it, and think about where he went wrong before replying. He is so set in stone about his stance, and seemingly cannot wrap his head around his actions being inappropriate, so I fear that if you guys talk in person, he will not actually hear what you\u2019re saying and just get irrationally defensive instead. \n\nStay calm. Explain clearly. Write a letter or if you\u2019re gonna do it in person, write down bullet points to follow. Remember to listen to him and consider his points before getting defensive, and make sure he does the same.  He thinks this is about him \u201cgoing to a play\u201d - make sure you\u2019re clear that this is actually, NOT about him going to a play.  This is about the fundamental respect in your relationship - or rather the lack thereof. \n\nYou guys will get through this.  Good luck to you!  I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll all work out in the end, it\u2019s just gonna take a little time. Consider couples counseling before getting married to work on communication, you guys need it. Sending hugs to you!\n\nETA: I read this to my husband. He brought up some good points from a dude\u2019s perspective. From my hubs: this is kind of still the \u201choneymoon phase\u201d. If it were me (my hubs), I would be on my best behavior. It would be important to me to make a good impression on my future MIL, and, I would *want* to take these visits to get to know her since they\u2019re so infrequent. If he doesn\u2019t wise up or is unwilling to see this from your perspective, he\u2019s telling you that he doesn\u2019t, and will never consider your family nor your feelings and wants, a priority. If he refuses to take accountability, this may very well be a good indication of how your marriage is going to go, and you need to put careful consideration into continuing this relationship.  You have made massive sacrifices for him, and have held up your end of the bargain. All you\u2019re asking is for him to keep his word and to show you, and your family, some respect in return - and at this point, he\u2019s clearly shown you he isn\u2019t willing to do that.  It doesn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to realize the double standard here, yet here we are\u2026",

Well, my dear, you are not crazy. </p>\n\n<p>I have a feeling he thinks this is all because he wanted to go to a play for his nephew - and how dare you deny him right to support him.  He absolutely does not get that it\u2019s a much bigger issue than that and it has deep roots that stretch beyond this situation. Some things to touch on when you talk again:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>This is becoming a pattern. He repeatedly has bailed on your family, which is something that is extremely important it is to you.
