      "selftext": "I posted yesterday and after reading alot of comments I decided to talk to my sil and clear things up, I am posting again for advice.\n\nI will drop a tldr for those who don't want to read my post, I told my family that I am looking for a partner to marry, but my sil kept hinting that I should marry her younger sister whenever she visited and she would most of the time talk about her, I confronted her and asked her and she told me that it's best if I marry her younger sister as it will strengthen our family.\n\nSo today I decided to talk to her, I called her up 2 hours ago to talk to her about this whole thing and clear things up.\n\nWhen she arrived I gave her coffee and I Apologised, I said I am sorry for making you cry and I didn't want to hurt you, I said I truly felt like you are pressuring me into marriage cause you always bring her up everytime you get a chance and it was so constant that I felt like I am being pressured\n\nI told her that marrying her younger sister is not a problem, being forced into is, Marriage is a life changing decision, I have always obeyed you and will always and if I do get married to her and it doesn't work out won't I and her sister suffer? \n\nShe said she didn't want to pressure me she said she just thought that it would be better if we marry each other cause we know and can trust each other and there won't be any other outsiders in our family and it will work out just fine.\n\nShe said it's my decision and she would never force me but she thinks that I should atleast talk to her sister and try, if it works for us then it's good if it doesn't then that's okay as well.\n\nI said I will think about it, I also need to talk to her sister, (which is also my sister but not blood related), she left after we hung out for an hour and I think we both have cleared it all up.\n\nI think I have cleared it up with my sil, she's my sister and family and didn't want to hurt her in anyway, this time I tried my best to not be as dismissive and direct like last time and I think she understood where I am coming from.\n\nSo any opinions or helpful advice?
