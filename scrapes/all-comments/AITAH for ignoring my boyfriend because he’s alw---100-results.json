      "selftext": "\nI (16F) have been dating my boyfriend (17M) for 7 months now, he\u2019s an amazing guy and I genuinely love him but he is always either late or has stuff happen last minute and we have to postpone hanging out.\n\nToday is one of the worst times, his sister is making soup dumplings and she messed up the broth so he stayed back to help her, which I sort of understand. But then he said he needed to do more homework and that he\u2019d see me in a couple hours. We\u2019re both on school holidays at the moment and have 8 weeks to do this stuff.\n\nWe initially planned to for him to get to my house at 10am but he\u2019s postponed to 2pm and I have to leave for work at about 4:30pm. I know 2 hours is still a lot but we\u2019d planned for so much longer and now my dad and brother are asking where he is and I\u2019m so embarrassed. I keep asking him if he can come earlier but he\u2019s sticking to 2pm.\n\nI\u2019m sitting in bed crying while writing this because the whole reason I wanted to see him in person today was because some of my health problems have worsened and become potentially life threatening. And I don\u2019t know how fast I\u2019m deteriorating and we\u2019re both going on family holidays in a few days so this might be the last time I see him while I\u2019m still somewhat healthy.\n\nAnyways he keeps texting me just random updates about his day and apologising for being late and I\u2019m leaving him on read. I know it\u2019s passive aggressive and that he has a life outside of me and I know he\u2019d never do this if he knew just how limited our time together might be, but it hurts so much.\nAITAH?",
