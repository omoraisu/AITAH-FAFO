      "selftext": "I m 20M i was in a relationship with a girl 20F for 2 years it was a very long and rough time\nWe had plenty of break ups and all. But things were kinda alright coz we had a lot of love , like we both were eachothers whole world.(I was a little more in love.. as in i kinda left behind all my friendships except a 20F who was like my sister and another 21F who was my close friend at that time now my bestfriend for last 2years)\nBut things got out of hand after my birthday we had a big fight about a guy who trying to get in her pants which she was completely denying but everyone knew his intentions.\nAnd we broke up..\nThen after 12days i see a chick's ig story where she was shipping my ex with some guy\nWriting some romantic things and all\nIt kinda got me furious but it was non my business.\n\nUntil june 2024.\nI texted her.\ud83d\udc49\ud83d\udc48 kinda my mistake yes\nBut it was one of those ngl(website) text. Where i wrote a heartfelt msg like i do think about you sometimes.\nBut i didnt mention my name or anythin\nShe understood it was me and texted me\nWe talkee back and forth about everything life and how studies are on and everything.\n\nI felt like she was not in a ship and wanted me\nShe also she still loved me and everything \nShe still messages to me in notes app, thought about me time to time\nKinda gave me too many signals.\nThen\nAsked me \"are you texting me to blackmail me that you'll show these to my boyfriend?)\nAnd my heart shattered but i cant show that to her coz i knew she was in a ship and never heard that they broke up.\nSo it was stupid of me to think she is alone\n\nIdk what i should feel and am i crazy to still be in love with her?",

Maybe she's not happy with the boyfriend and will break up, or maybe she is ok with emotional cheating (which is what she is doing).  Either way it would likely end messily - you could wind up more hurt than you already are.",
