      "selftext": "I was with my ex for 7 years. For 7 years I learnt his language, his culture, his religion and I went above and beyond for everything related to his family. I was the main earner so I had no problem paying the rent, helping his family financially during the pandemic and co signing for his car etc because his credit was terrible. I was completely in love with him and I could not have done more to be a perfect girlfriend. I even learnt to fucking cook.\n\nMain earner and home cooked meals.\n\nHis mother moved in with us and he worked long hours (so I thought) so I was often left with her because she was new to the area and knew no one. And again, emotionally and financially I did everything for her as well as everything for her dickhead son. \n\nWith his new car (that he had because of me) he wanted to go on a road trip around the country. He had never travelled much and I couldn't get the time off approved from work so he went alone. \n\nOn my birthday, he worked overtime. Christmas day he had to work. \n\nOne of his colleagues often stalked my Instagram and he told me he hardly knew her, she was just a nosy kid. My instincts told me that didn't sound right so I spent 6 months paranoid with him telling me I was crazy and jealous and that I needed therapy. Then his insults got worse and then the physical abuse started.\n\nMy friend was aware of my suspicions and she was keeping an eye on this girl's posts for me. \n\nBoxing day arrived and I was absolutely miserable after spending yet another holiday alone with his mother ( my family live in a different state) and my friend sent me a screenshot of this girl's story and in the background I could see his car. \n\nI confronted him and found out that they had been together for almost a year. She had known about me the entire time and didn't care. They went on holiday together. The money I gave him for various fines/clothes/random shit he was giving to her. His mother had known and had met her several times. He was never working long hours or overtime. He had been fired 3 months earlier and all those long days he was 'working' and I was with his mother he was actually with his other girlfriend.\n\nThis is where I'm an AH. I saw red.\n\nWhen I left,  I took his car keys, his motorbike keys, his Xbox, his games, all his ID, his comic collection (worth a lot), his clothes, every lightbulb, every shoe, every pan, every remote control, every pair of jeans and every cable in the house. \n\nSome of those things I bought, some of them I didn't. \n\nWhen he was calling me afterwards begging me to go back to him and to tell him where his things where I could only reply that I've got no idea what he's talking about, he's going crazy and he should consider therapy, exactly like he always told me.\n\nAbout a month later in a nightclub I bumped into some of his friends. That night I slept with his childhood best friend.\n\nA couple of months later I bumped into his other girlfriend. She actually tried to be nice to me and she seemed extremely interested in what I was doing/how i was doing. Obviously I had blocked them both but I was still obsessing over them on my friends account so I knew they had stayed together. As subtle as possible I said that I was doing great, we had been in therapy and we were working it out, I couldn't stay long though because I was late to meet ***  and I left before she could reply.\n\nShe thought he was now cheating on her with me and from a bit of online stalking, I knew they had split up a couple of days later. \n\nHe's now single, comic bookless with no clothes, no way of cooking, no income, with friends he cant trust, living in the dark and with no way of proving who he is\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffc\n\nIf your going to reply with a negative opinion then don't bother. Like I said in the beginning I have 0 regrets.\ud83d\ude43\n",
