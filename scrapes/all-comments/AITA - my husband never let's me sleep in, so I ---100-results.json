      "selftext": "As the title states, I wake my husband up every morning we are off together, neither of us ever get a day to sleep in.\n\nWe used to alternate, this stopped once our son became a toddler though.\nAny time my husband has agreed to get up with our son he is as slow as molasses getting up, so I end up tending to our little guy first, which wakes me up.\nThen if I try to go back to bed he let's our toddler bang on the door, call for mama, and open it, again not allowing me to sleep.\nI have suggested that he takes him out but he doesn't like doing that alone.\n\nWe both work, I work Monday to Thursday, he works shift work (4 on, 5 off, rotating schedule) I'm with our son every day that I'm off, my husband is off sometimes while our son is in daycare and I'm working.\nOn those days I ask that he drops our son off at daycare so our son can sleep in a bit - since whenever I drop him off he has to be up by 5:40 am, even if he didn't sleep well or was up late.\n\nThe part that might make me the AH, is that i don't think it's fair that I never get to sleep in, so he shouldn't either - especially since he has several days each month that he is home alone, sure he has to get up for a little bit to take care of our son, but then he drops him off at daycare for the whole day until I pick him up after work.\n\nSomething to note, I was supposed to have Fridays as my day off alone, but our son has been sick alot (1st year of daycare) so since I make less money than my husband, I'm the one who has to miss work when he is sick.\nDue to this, I go in on my Fridays off to make up time every week.",

She often gets to sleep in more than me now. I'm constantly woken up by tapping on my shoulder to let her in under the covers.\n\nHave you tried communicating your frustration with lack of sleep?
