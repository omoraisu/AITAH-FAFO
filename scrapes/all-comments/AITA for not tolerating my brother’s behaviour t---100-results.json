      "selftext": "I, 24F have two brothers - 27M and 19M. My older brother and I were born while my parents were working in the US. After I was born, due to some family drama and to be closer to my grandparents we had to leave. \n\nHowever, this means that my younger brother was not born in the US, and only holds Indian citizenship. \n\nMy younger brother was supposed to go to university in the US last year, but couldn\u2019t because his student visa got rejected. He blamed this on me and our brother. He said that when he went for his visa interview, everything was going well until they asked him whether he has any immediate family members that are US citizens or living in the US. So when he disclosed that both his older siblings are American, he claims that the entire tone of the interview changed. Mind you, this is entirely speculation. He wasn\u2019t told why his visa was rejected, just that it was unsuccessful. \n\nHe was horrible in the weeks after the rejection. He would alternate between ignoring me and screaming at me. Once he stole my wallet and went on a shopping spree with my card and didn\u2019t apologise because I \u201cowe\u201d him. \n\nHe still acts out sometimes, but it\u2019s gotten much better since he moved out and started uni this year. I don\u2019t put up with him when he acts like that, which I think worries our parents because they think our relationship will never recover. \n\nMy mom tells me to forgive him, look the other way when he says hurtful things and think about how much stress he went through and how all his hopes had come crashing down. I told her I don\u2019t believe I should have to do that, but she just says I\u2019m being ungrateful. In her mind, I\u2019ve never been through anything like that so it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m being \u2018hard\u2019 on my brother. ",

He is also willing to be contacted in case of any issues needing clarity. (If he did not have this documentation, it was his failure to prep. You being American does not automatically disqualify him).\n\nBasically, any visa is tied to the likelihood of return. The likelihood of u completing the course and not becoming a problem. The interview is to establish confidence in the immigration officer that your entry is an overall positive thing. I have never met an immigration officer who likes an arrogant immigrant, for instance. What do u want to bet he may have been just this at the process? Overconfident in himself, which read wrong to the officer? You had little to nothing to do with it. If you were a relevant factor, the officer may have likely called you. Your brother is responsible for poorly preparing for the interview and thereby failing. \n\nDo not tolerate his nonsense, and it is not your fault that he did not get the visa. Ignoring his behaviour will be an enabling action that emboldens those bad habits. You have to put a stamp on it now. Otherwise, your little brother will continue to be a spoilt brat that is encouraged by your parents. I have failed interviews for visas. And did not get the visas.
