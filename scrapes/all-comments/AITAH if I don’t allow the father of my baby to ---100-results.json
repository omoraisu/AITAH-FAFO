      "selftext": "I have been seeing the father for the last seven months. We were not officially gf/bf, but we\u2019re exclusive, seeing each other two to three times a week and talking/texting every day. Quoting him \u201cwe are doing everything you do dating and in a relationship, but without the title.\u201d he has met part of my family and my friends however, he never introduced me to any of his friends or family saying he needs to be in a serious relationship before that to happen. unfortunately one of my meds counteracted my bc, (was not antibiotics or medication commonly known to affect birth control) my pcm didn\u2019t even know that it was a possibility without doing some research but now we are pregnant. Last night he dropped a bomb on me that he can no longer see me because he feels like if we get into an official relationship he is only doing it for the child. Nor can he be friends with me or hang out with me or anything with me. He is essentially abandoning me at six weeks pregnant. He stated he has no responsibility to me while I am pregnant or to help me unless it is a serious matter. His only responsibility will be to the baby when it comes. He still wants to be in the delivery room, have an option in the baby\u2019s name and get 50-50 custody. A few of his comments that really stuck at me last night  Me: \u201cwe are pregnant, I need help, I don\u2019t want to do this by myself emotionally and physically this way will be draining at least be my friend.\u201d\nFather: \u201cno, you are pregnant. I will be there when the child is born. I owe you nothing.\u201d\nMe: \u201c aren\u2019t you gonna wanna feel a child kicking in me and all the other wonders of pregnancy?\u201d\nFather: \u201c no this wasn\u2019t planned so I don\u2019t want to\u201d\nMe: \u201c what if I get too big and I can\u2019t tie my own shoes and I need help with daily stuff\u201d\nFather:  \u201c buy slip on shoes\u201d\nI completely understand the relationship aspect of his statement but I feel like he is completely abandoning me and just wants to step back in when the baby is born. How do I trust or let somebody in when they just left us?\nMore so how do I let someone see me give birth and such a vulnerable position who just walked away from me at six weeks? We are not married. I legally do not have to put his name on the birth certificate and then he would have to petition the courts for paternal rights. Also, I don\u2019t know any of his family or where they live. I don\u2019t want my newborn out of my sight with strangers if he can abandon me how do I know he\u2019s gonna bring back the baby. \n\nSidenote: he wants to coparent in the future and have a flexible visiting schedule due to his job. I don\u2019t know how I can coparent with someone who isn\u2019t going to help me through this pregnancy and expect me to be able to be flexible for him in the future. Also, he stated that his career will be become before the child on multiple occasions. I want the baby to know their father and want them to see each other. What I won\u2019t do is bend over backwards to give him his flexible schedule that allows him to focus on himself and only himself and be a father when it\u2019s easy for him. \nI\u2019m looking for compromise and understanding if we are raising a child with 50-50 custody. \nFor clarification, I don\u2019t care about being in a romantic relationship with him. That ship has sailed since last night\u2019s conversation. I\u2019m looking for friendship to make our future easier. ",

It was challenging but I have no regrets. \n\nThe disadvantage to court ordered child support comes with court ordered visitation wherein you get no say whatsoever. \n\nI heeded advice from my aunt before my son was born: give child my last name & do not put father on birth certificate. Best advice ever. Would have been so difficult in dealing with schools had the \"father\" been on the birth certificate and/or my son didn't have my last name.\n\nHere's the story in brief. My ex was an abusive drunk. I opted for no child support so I could control when he saw our son, at least until my son was old enough to express concerns. In my situation, the little bit of money that I would have received was not worth putting my son in the car with a man who would drive drunk & I would have been forced to hand my son over had I pursued child support. By the time my son was older, my ex had long ago stopped showing any desire to see son. I tried, for my son's sake, but the man just wouldn't. We still know where he is and my son doesn't want to reach out. Now, it's my son's choice.\n\nThere's someone amiss with your guy. Red flags with never meeting his friends or family. He's definitely hiding something OR you're just a \"side chick\". Either way, it is disrespectful to you and I wouldn't trust him to be alone with the baby, either. If I was you, I'd seriously reconsider taking him to court. At least until you learn more about him and if he then proves to be trustworthy.\n\nAlso, if you're not comfortable being in the delivery, he shouldn't be there. Simply don't call him. My friend refused to call my ex and I am now grateful.",

Would have been so difficult in dealing with schools had the &quot;father&quot; been on the birth certificate and/or my son didn&#39;t have my last name.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#39;s the story in brief. My ex was an abusive drunk. I opted for no child support so I could control when he saw our son, at least until my son was old enough to express concerns. In my situation, the little bit of money that I would have received was not worth putting my son in the car with a man who would drive drunk &amp; I would have been forced to hand my son over had I pursued child support. By the time my son was older, my ex had long ago stopped showing any desire to see son. I tried, for my son&#39;s sake, but the man just wouldn&#39;t. We still know where he is and my son doesn&#39;t want to reach out. Now, it&#39;s my son&#39;s choice.</p>\n\n<p>There&#39;s someone amiss with your guy. Red flags with never meeting his friends or family. He&#39;s definitely hiding something OR you&#39;re just a &quot;side chick&quot;. Either way, it is disrespectful to you and I wouldn&#39;t trust him to be alone with the baby, either. If I was you, I&#39;d seriously reconsider taking him to court. At least until you learn more about him and if he then proves to be trustworthy.</p>\n\n<p>Also, if you&#39;re not comfortable being in the delivery, he shouldn&#39;t be there. Simply don&#39;t call him. My friend refused to call my ex and I am now grateful.</p>\n</div>",

It is essentially an agreed upon contract where you can state which parent has legal and physical custody or the percentages each gets if you share custody, schedule of visitation including holidays, child support, who gets to claim on taxes, rules of visitation if necessary (where is permissable travel and with who, and any other specifics of your parenting agreement.  There is a large amount of free information about parenting plans and free templates online. You can propose a Parenting Plan and, if he agrees to it, file it with the courts. It can prevent a court battle or letting a judge decide for you. I understand you are upset, his treatment of you is really unkind. He will have rights as the biological father and anything you do to make things more difficult for him will be frowned upon by the court. It will be best for you to be fair but take any precautions you need to protect your child. You definitely have the right to know where the child will be staying when in his care within reason, permanent address makes sense but knowing where Dad takes the child to visit doesn't because the court will see Dad as being able to make those decisions unless he has proven that he is unsafe. As far as knowing his friends and family or their addresses, legally you are not entitled to that information. Most courts will agree that a small infant, especially if breastfeeding,  should not have extended periods away from the mother. If this becomes a battle make sure the focus is on the child not how Dad has treated you, because if he wasn't abusive it will not matter. You will be legally bound to this man for 18 years after the child is born. You will have the most influence over what happens with your child if you are fair and make your decisions based on truly what is best for the child (which the court will believe involves both parents having equal access if deserved). I do not know your position on abortion or the legalities in your state but I recommend researching all of your options because co-parenting with someone successfully takes mutual respect and a total investment into seeing the child flourish, this man seems like he will not make the next 18 years a good experience. I recommend reading as much as you can about what your rights are and what you can kegally expect from him. He has told you that he will not be emotionally involved with you at all, but he may have some financial obligations towards your pregnancy depending on where you live or he may not have to offer any support until it is solely for the child. Some states have laws requiring men to pay part of pregnancy expenses but most do not. If you can afford to, seek a family law attorney to help you draft a Parenting Plan and present it to him. If he doesn't agree, take him to court for child support and to establish custody and visitation. Good luck!",
