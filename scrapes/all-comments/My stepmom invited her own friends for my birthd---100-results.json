      "selftext": "My birthday was a couple months ago, but this still bothers me. My stepmom (She's 41f) invited her own friends to my birthday at cedar point. I hate little kids they are gross and clingy. She brought her friends with 2 children of ages 5 and 6. Before the trip, I begged her not to invite them due to them having kids, but she said no. These children stayed in our hotel room, their family got the second bed, my dad and stepmom got the other. I slept on the floor on my own birthday. We couldn't ride any of the rides I wanted to, because they were too little. These children also stayed with us without their parents because their parents \"needed a break.\" Another thing to note is I was not familiar with these children, and like stated earlier I do not like small children. I have autism, and being around all of these other people at cedar point was enough for me, I didn't need to hang out with them. The floor of the hotel room also gave me some sensory issues with it, because it was scratchy and all I got was a sheet that I used to be warm because they had the AC on. I would've rather not gone if I had known I would've been treated like that for my own birthday trip.",
