      "selftext": "I m35 just found out my wife f33 of nearly 12 years cheated on me with an old friend from high school. I work away a fair bit, about two weeks at a time (something we agreed upon together) in order to build a deposit to buy a house. We recently moved back to her home town to be closer to her parents as a support network while I was away. Up until recently I felt we had a happy marriage, we had regular date nights, shared hobbies and travel and rarely argued. My last trip away was cut short due to extreme weather and I returned home two days early. As I got home there was an unknown car in the driveway which I soon found out was another man (no I didn't catch them \"in the act\" but she quickly admitted why he was there). After a quick chat with my neighbour it was clear that he had been around regularly. I am devastated \ud83d\udc94.  I didn't at all see this coming. She told me I was away too much and she needed more than I could offer her. She also told me that she was sorry and wanted to stay together, though, I don't think I can, I feel betrayed and bitter and heartbroken. Am I wrong for working away to try and build a future? And should I swallow my pride and try again with her?",
