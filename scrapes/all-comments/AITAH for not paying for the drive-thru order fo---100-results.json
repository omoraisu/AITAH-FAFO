      "selftext": "I went through a fast food drive-thru this morning to grab a coffee on the way to work. Some generous soul (presumably multiple cars ahead of me) had started a chain reaction of paying the bill for the person in line behind them. So when I pulled up to pay, the nice young woman informed me that it was already paid for. I was at a decision point- I looked in my rear view mirror at the $90,000 truck with a family of five or six, then looked at the five dollar bill in my hand, smiled at the drive-thru attendant, said \u201cThank you\u201d, put the money back in my wallet and drove off with my free coffee. AITAH for breaking the chain of generosity and goodwill?",

No big deal.\n\n\nWhen someone is trying to make themselves LOOK like a 'good' person and the other person doesn't actually want help, they can't handle it because they NEED to be seen doing something good and the person they're trying to help is just being so UNGRATEFUL.\n\n\nPlus if he didn't end up eating it, then that was just a waste of food... And $5 if he never even opened the bag.\n\n\nAnd I don't have a lot of money so the trip and original lunch plans were already a splurge without another meal being added (I later paid for my sister's lunch as well).\n\n\nSo (and I feel bad thinking this) even though it went against his wishes I kind of hope he accepted it in the end.

Forever grateful to that guy!\n\nI am a bit better at parking, now, but not so much! Best I can do is back off for the new parkers, and take the aggressive wankers beeping, while the newbie parks :) \n\nI live in a small town, with tiny mediaeval streets, a week ago, some huge long removal lorry had to deliver, it is not much more than a single track road, and his trailer took up half of the length! Roads into/out of are the same, with sharp turns, tall trees, and no visibility, except for the one road - with a low bridge. Whoever sent that young man down this route with a lorry that size really misjudged the roads. Driver was young, and seemed capable on the way in, unloading, etc. Getting out, omg, poor guy tried to reverse out, and failed. No one would hold back enough to let the trailer bit come through, no pedestrians paid him the slightest attention, just carried on doing whatever. I don\u2019t think people understand just how long some of these lorries are, we just think, \u201coh well, they got in, they can get out\u201d without understanding how much clearance they need, blind spots, etc.Then tried driving straight out, also failed because of all the on street parking, I mean, my Peugeot 206 barely fits past the cars in that road when the spaces are full!) \n\nPoor guy was a bit embarrassed, and likely getting crap for not being on schedule, he was trying to get out for half an hour when I finally stepped in (though a lorry that size really shouldn\u2019t be making deliveries in a region like ours, every winding corner means 10 minutes of manoeuvring, if other drivers cooperate. Not his fault, though.) My German is crap, my Polish even worse (guessing from his name plate, he was Polish) and I have no parking skills. Best I could do was drive my little car to the corner, gesture at him to reverse, and tolerate the beeping. Would\u2019ve liked to be more helpful, but with my parking skills, would probably have got him sacked. Hopefully, he will be ok, and laugh about the random english woman with her tiny right hand drive car in a tiny town some day, lol!\n\nDon\u2019t know how you guys manage in some of the tiny spaces with high buildings everywhere, especially when random drivers/cyclists/pedestrians just blindly drive/walk around as normal. I was always taught as a kid that lorries have huge blind spots, don\u2019t go in one, stay visible and predictable. Gotta be hard enough to drive those things in small streets at the best of times, don\u2019t make it harder and more dangerous. When I am on the motorway, I often dream of driving a lorry\u2026 and as soon as I see them in towns, I realise I will never have the reversing skills, even if I could trust that every other person around wasn\u2019t being an idiot (like the woman with a pram who walked right behind the reversing lorry in my town, stopped, and then had a conversation with her friend\u2026)",

If I found out that someone I gave a tip to was forced to give it up and put it in a donation bin by management, I'd have a problem with it. Especially since it's a \"company\" charity. That means they're taking the tip I gave to the employee and then turning around and using it to get a tax break for the company. They're taking that tip for themselves with extra steps and paperwork, but make no mistake, they're taking it for themselves. In my opinion it's theft from their employee.",

They only know the cost of the next person\u2019s order and they are putting people in a horrible situation if they can only afford to pay for their own order.\n\nAt the end of the day, people going through a drive thru for food and drinks already know that they have the funds to pay for their own order. \n\nStop with this crap and donate to a food bank instead. The cost of a coffee will probably feed a child breakfast and lunch.",
