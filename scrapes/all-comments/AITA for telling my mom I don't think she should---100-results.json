      "selftext": "My parents have seven kids together and I'm (16f) the youngest. My parents liked different names. So they took turns naming us. Dad liked more uncommon and unique names and mom liked more old school or traditional names.\n\nSo naming went like \n\nSister - mom \n\nSister - dad \n\nBrother - mom\n\nSister - dad\n\nBrother - mom\n\nBrother - dad\n\nMe - mom\n\nMy siblings are all okay/happy with their names. Two of my siblings use nicknames which drives mom crazy because they never like to use their formal name that she chose for them and it bothers her. But they don't hate their given name. They just prefer the nicknames.\n\nI never liked my name. Like ever. I always thought it old sounding and to me it doesn't sound pretty. I've gone by a nickname totally unrelated forever and I have talked about wanting to change my name before. Dad knows and supports me. But mom said I can't hate my name, which is Julia, she said it's a gorgeous name and I should feel lucky I got one of her names and not one of dad's. I said I like dad's names and said my nickname is way more like his choices than hers. She said it's not fair and he can't get one more in his style.\n\nShe told me I need to like my name and I can't change my name ever if she doesn't approve. I told her I don't think she should decide how I feel about my name or get to demand I keep my name. I said I'll be an adult and able to pay for it myself eventually.\n\nMom said I was disrespecting her. And she said it's not fair that she already didn't get to like all our names and now dad will have more than her.\n\nAITA?",
