      "selftext": "Okay, so this is my first post. I've been thinking about this for a few weeks now and I don't know who to ask or who to trust that information with, so why give it to the whole internet right ?\n\nFor context, I came out as bisexual a pretty long time ago and just recently finally came out as a lesbian. We've been best friends for 5 to 6 years, friends for even more.\n\nA few years ago, around 2019 or 2020, I was in an open heterosexual relationship and I wanted to experience intimacy with a woman so I thought why not ask my best friend. So I told her if she ever wanted to try it out, I was here. Nothing happened since she politely turned me down, and I never really thought about it again until this year.\n\nThe open relationship I was in at the time ended at the end of summer 2022, and she kindly offered that I stayed at her house, just to get back on my feet, find a new place since I was living with my ex. And that's what happened. Found a new place, got back on my feet, took me a few years but here we are.\n\nIn septembre of this year (2024) I broke up with the guy I'd been dating for 5 months by coming out as a lesbian. He was heartbroken, I was all over the place because I didn't know how the fuck I could've missed it. And then, something really weird started to happen. As you may have guessed, it involves my best friend.\n\nI came out to her and my inner circle, and from that precise moment, it's like something shifted inside me ? I started reassessing, reliving some of the things we've done together this year, things I hadn't thought much about but that came really clear to me as signs of me being kinda into her.\n\nFirst, we went out for her birthday and she reminded me about that time I asked her to get intimate years ago. I had completely forgotten - I know it seems far fetched but I swear, I regularly forget to EAT SO, not that far fetched for me. So I was a bit shoked and amused that she remembered and seemed to remember vivdly. Then, after another night out with colleagues of hers we went to get some food to go. My order came first, so I waited outside and when she came out, I swear there was a moment I thought she was going to straight up kiss me. She caught herself in the moment, we laughed it off, talked about how she couldn't handle beer. Then again, I didn't think much of it in the moment.\n\nThen there's the little pet names. She used to catch herself calling me love and all, saying she was sorry. Again, I made the reason to be because she spent a lot of time with her boyfriend - yea, I know, I'll get to that - that she just needed to adapt and she was just saying it out of habit. But then she stopped. Not calling me names, but apologizing and finding excuses.\n\nAlso, she told me a long time ago that when she was a teenager, she fell in love with another girl - online, they never met irl - but never told her. She never dated a woman and has claimed to be heterosexual ever since, though I vaguely remember one talk about how she might be bisexual, but she quickly went back to claiming she was 100% hetersexual. She sends me reels of women she finds hot, and crushes on some feminine characters in series of all sorts, and that's that.\n\nNOW, for the boyfriend part. They've been together for 2 years now, I practicaly pushed her into his arms, because I dated the guys for 3 months back in 2017 and she wasn't very comfortable with it. Since I didn't really care, and I thought it would be too bad for her to be missing out on something that could make her happy just because of that, I pushed her a bit.\n\nAnd now, whenever I think of this, or them together, I cringe. Whenever she mentions her \"lover\" I struggle to keep a straight face, and it feels like she's doing it to remind someone that she's in a relationship but lately I've been asking myself. If that's true, who's she reminding ? At the beginning of the month, we went to a concert together, her favorite band's concert. Her boyfriend was there and he acted like a complete asshole and it really pissed me off. To the point I wanted to fight him for almost ruining that moment for her.\n\nAnyways, ever since I came out (septembre 2024) I've been denying myself the truth, then started questionning the nature of my feelings for her, which brings us here because I'm pretty sure a best friend doesn't think \"you don't deserve her, if you can't treat her right then lemme do it, asshole\". Even though self-esteem and all makes me doubt I even deserve her but that's another conversation.\n\nSo I haven't been thinking of her sexually - I won't allow it, it wouldn't be respectful and I'm terrified honestly. That someone notices something and tells her, if she doesn't notice it first hand. Cause I think that my behavior might be starting to show signs of my big fat underlying secret. Last week we went grocerie shopping - we always go together - and there we a lot of people in the same aisle, we were kinda stuck together in a tight space between carts and stuff and I just witnessed myself putting a hand around her waist and pulling her close to me. It lasted for just a second and when I realized what I was doing, I immidiately let her go, played it cool, like it was a joke or something and got out of the spot soon as the space cleared.\n\nI'd been thinking I should keep this whole thing to myself cause I don't want to interfere with her current relationship, she deserves to be happy and I wouldn't wanna jeopardize that. Also because I obviously don't wanna ruin our relationship, and can't help but have a tiny bit of hope that she might be having feelings too. But another thought just flashed through my mind. What if hiding it from her and having those thoughts and feelings was just as bad as when you discover that a man you thought was a friend was actually trynna get you into bed all along ? \n\nShould I tell her ? Should I sit this one out and wait, keep my mouth shut see if my feelings even last ? I don't know what to do I'm fucking lost and I need yall to be honest.\n\nAm I the asshole for not telling her I am falling for her ?\n\nSorry for the long ass post.",
