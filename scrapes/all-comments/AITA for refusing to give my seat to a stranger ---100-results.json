      "selftext": "Last weekend, I went to see my favorite band, and I'd gotten tickets months in advance for a great seat close to the stage. When I got there, a woman and her younger daughter were in my seat. I politely showed them my ticket, expecting them to move, but the mom asked if I could take the daughter's seat further back because her daughter was a huge fan. I hesitated because I\u2019d been looking forward to this view and experience for so long.\n\n  \nFeeling a bit guilty but firm, I explained how much this concert meant to me and opted to keep my seat. They moved without making a scene, but I noticed glares from some people nearby and felt somewhat judged. As the concert went on, I tried to focus on the show, but it gnawed at me. Was I selfish for standing my ground? I didn't want to ruin their night, but this was a big deal for me, too. Thoughts?",

Our problem was that it was the start of the line and the driver hadn't hit the button to display reservations yet when we were boarding. We didn't know which train we'd be getting until we were done with our day out, so I hadn't booked our return journey tickets and got them at the station kiosk. The problem that I managed to encounter after that was the train had filled up and there was only 1 free unreserved seat. I needed 2 seats (which I had tickets for, the younger child was free and both kids were small enough to share a single seat) together as the kids were too young to sit alone but too big to sit both sit on my lap. We ended up between carriages, which wouldn't have happened if the reservations were displayed when we were boarding the train. The lesson I learned is to book seats regardless and work the day around the train time instead of the other way around.",

He was being the judgemental supertive d!ck and she the foulmouthed high pitched Karen.</p>\n\n<p>I stayed calm and repeated my only response. &#39;According to my ticket, this seat was allocated to me, please move to your designated spot&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Thing was I was politely blocking the isle ( 2m, 125 kg male; 6&#39;7, 260 poinds in freedom units). Passengers in that line were slowly getting annoyed and eventually a stewardess made her way to me.</p>\n\n<p>The Karen exploded from the get go, painting me as some insensitive POS not donating my seat.\nI remained calm and when the stewardess turned to me, she simply said &#39;give me 2 minutes&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>A few moments later, the intercom rang: &#39;could passenger &#39;my name&#39; please come towards the business section&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Karen was somewhat bemused but gave me a &#39;good to see you leave POS&#39; send off.</p>\n\n<p>Roughly midway towards the business class, the intercom sounded out: &#39; To the lady currently occupiyng seat X , rest assured the gentleman will not longer be bothering you&#39;. \nKaren screamed out &#39;finally justice&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>With a crackle the intercom continued, &#39; we will safely hold the gentleman in our business class section, which is unfortunately off-limits to you&#39;. &#39;Please enjoy your flight....etc.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Nice upgrade.</p>\n</div>",
