      "selftext": "so basically for some backstory context, my best friend and I constantly fight (like 3 times a day about the stupidest things), and she usually starts those arguments. she gets severally petty and complains to her boyfriend about me after every argument. btw this story is just a lot of teen drama.\n\nI (f15) have been friends with (let's call her jane, f16) for about 2 years now. jane lied to me for months about dating her current boyfriend (let's call him John, m16), because she assumed I wouldn't like their relationship (I didn't because I used to like him, like hard core in love with him and out of no where she started dating him), and so now after our heated arguments, she runs to him to complain about me. the main reason I'm upset is because she allows him to call me a bitch and a wh*re when I'm \"in the wrong\". I thought that as my best friend, she wouldn't let her boyfriend do that, but I was wrong. he takes her side all the time, even when she's so completely wrong. so, aita or just dramatic?",

I know not everybody's situation is the same so I'm not trying to project my experience onto yours but I had a cousin that was a best friend for over 15 years and I saw her toxic ways and I always forgave her because I loved her so much and trying to just be a safe place for her where she would also get honesty, I tried to be a healthy person for her but it drag me down and in the end she was a two-faced backstabber and I still love her enough to try to forgive her even though I was done with the friendship and relieved in a way that she had done it because that was the last straw for me and it was finally over.
