      "selftext": "I have my friend who I love dearly and I think now she thinks am a fake friend. Recently, she came up with an idea to borrow money form me to buy an iPhone ( she wants a good one like iPhone 12 to 14) here\u2019s a back story. She  has a baby now and stays at home don\u2019t work and her rent is 2 months due and the baby daddy doesn\u2019t help her well financially because he don\u2019t want to be involved in her life as he informed her already at the start that he\u2019s married to two wives( he\u2019s a Moslem ) and has kids already so didn\u2019t want anything  serious with her. She later on conceived and decided to keep the baby even after numerous requests from  the man to abort(which I\u2019m happy  she has a lovely baby) She recently came out and told me to buy an iPhone for  her such that she can resume her online selling of clothes. I told her that\u2019s ok, I will get the phone on  credit in my name and info and she can pay for it in monthly installments x4 . She refused because she said she couldn\u2019t afford that monthly payment as it was too much for her. I came up with another idea that let\u2019s get a cheaper Samsung which can help u for the start of your online selling and later on u can upgrade. She refused because she says all her information is on iCloud and therefore she needs an iPhone ( she had iPhone 7 which her baby spoilt). I still told her to ask half of the money from Her baby daddy and I will contribute half too and she can pay it later. She still refused because the man doesn\u2019t give her money anymore and don\u2019t pick her calls .  She wants me to buy the phone and give it to her and she can pay anytime  with any mount she has , I also refused   because I can\u2019t buy her an expensive phone of which she has no job and I\u2019m not sure if I will be paid and besides i can\u2019t be wasting my hard earned money like that over  a non productive issue . Am I a fake friend?",
