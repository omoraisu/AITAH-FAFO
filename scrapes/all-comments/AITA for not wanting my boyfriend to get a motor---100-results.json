      "selftext": "Me and my Bf (both 20) have been together for 2 years. He\u2019s been talking about wanting a bike but never really went through with it but now he\u2019s seriously cracking down on buying a friends bike and testing for his permit on tuesday. I know several bikers who have been killed/severely injured or paralyzed from bike wrecks and i don\u2019t want that to happen to him. I\u2019m so beyond stressed in this situation and he\u2019s not taking anything i say seriously and calling me overprotective. I made a deal with him that i\u2019ll let up on not wanting him to get a bike as long as he agrees that in the first 2 years of him riding if he gets any speeding tickets going 15+ mph over posted speed limit he sells the bike which he reluctantly agreed to. Am i being overprotective and overbearing or am i just being concerned for his safety. (PSA he already gets in tons of trouble with speeding in cars alone which makes me more freaked about him getting a bike. He\u2019s gotten several super speeders and even arrested once for doing 55+ over the posted speed limit)",
