      "selftext": "(20f) I\u2019m just going to be blunt because I\u2019m so upset I have severe autism and one of my triggers is my hair getting played with or touched and he keeps doing it he\u2019s 24. I\u2019ll even cringe and sometimes scream and screech for him to stop but he just doesn\u2019t and says \u201cit\u2019s instinctive and I like your hair\u201d this has resulted in multiple autistic meltdowns to the iam crying and screaming and he calls me dramatic and says it\u2019s \u201cfucking weird\u201d and that he forgets I hate it. I don\u2019t find ANYTHING soothing about it and now he\u2019s stepped on my toes big time. I don\u2019t even want him touching AT ALL I feel violated and I feel like he has no idea what autism is. He\u2019s way too heavy handed too which has made my sensory issues unbearable around him. All I want is to be loved he never even hugs me but will happily do something that triggers my autism. Why \ud83d\ude22\n\nit sounds so pathetic but my mother used to really hurt me when I was younger she would drag me around by my hair when I was only 3/4 years old and she would hit me with the hair brush if she\u2019d left my hair to get matted and she couldn\u2019t brush it. Not only is it a sensory problem it\u2019s trauma related he knows this he just apparently forgets \ud83d\ude22",

Or you just have a year of awkward hair. Even in the worst possible case scenario where you hate your hair for a year... it's still worth it to have tried and found that out about yourself. In 5 years it'd be an awkward memory and a great story to pass down, but lots of people DON'T regret buzzing it all.\n\nAll the people who are telling you \"no don't do it\" and \"you'll regret it!\" wouldn't want it for themselves and haven't unlearned a lot of patriarchal crap about women's value being in being appealing to the largest grouping of men. You won't be more or less beautiful without long hair. Your bone structure will be the same. Your mind will be the same. You will look less like the modern ideal of a fertility idol to cishet dudes who believe Megan Fox has the normal Girl Next Door Look.\n\nYour relationship will probably end (it should, it really should) but the new you will be so goddamn free of  heavy hair, and men, and other people's weighty and useless expectations.\n\nMaybe try a buzzcut tiktok filter to see how it will look. Reach out to some local hair salons to see if anyone would cut it for free for the before and after shots of a \"big chop\" or donate it to a wig charity for cancer.

If you can try to reframe this sensation in your mind maybe having someone you trust touch your hair can build up a tolerance over time and rewrite some of your emotions and memories tied to it.\n\nJust an example and part of why I suggested this; I grew up in a very abusive household as well and have many triggers. One is hearing loud noises especially through walls and floors where you can feel it too. Growing up hearing these noises meant my dad was on a rampage and I needed to be ready to put myself in between him and my younger siblings. Well, several years ago I lived in an apartment complex where there were children in the apartment above me. They were constantly jumping around. Early in the morning, it would abruptly startle me awake and send me into panic attacks at times. It would go on all day. Obviously it was frustrating but over time I was able to soothe myself into not being triggered by this because these children were HAPPY. They were laughing and playing and it was precious. Eventually their jumps became a sweet thing for me to listen to. I am still triggered other locations and scenarios where I don\u2019t know the situation but in some instances you can reframe these things in your mind and how you perceive them.\n\nSide note: also autistic and understand your sensory issues and how intense they can be which is why I wanted to try to help.",
