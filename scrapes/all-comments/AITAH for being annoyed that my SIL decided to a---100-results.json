      "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nSo my husband and I have just had our first child. We live a two hour flight from my husband\u2019s family (his mum, dad, brother, SIL and sister) but talk to them regularly via virtual means. \n\nWhen our baby was 4 weeks old, we went to go visit them so that everyone could meet our baby. This was the first time they had met her and it was a big thing for my husband\u2019s parents. The first day was planned to be a family get together for our baby and to celebrate her arrival.\n\nNow my SIL has a habit of loving everything to be about her, and doesn\u2019t really like talking about anything that doesn\u2019t relate to her (ie. when she was pregnant, I had to know all the details, the nursery plan ect, yet when I was pregnant 12 months later - she couldn\u2019t have cared less. Same goes for engagement and our weddings). Everything has to be about her. I have shrugged it off in the past as that just \u2018being her\u2019 however for the first time, I am an actually quite annoyed. \n\nAt this gathering, within 30 minutes of everyone walking through the door and hardly seeing us or anyone getting to talk about our baby she dresses her toddler in a \u2018big brother shirt\u2019 - to announce to everyone they are pregnant again. Whilst I am happy for her and my BIL, I am also quite annoyed that they couldn\u2019t even give us this time to be about our baby because of course, then all she could talk about was her pregnancy so far, talking about what we think the gender might be ect,her plans for work ect\u2026..she couldn\u2019t have appeared any less interested in her newborn niece if she tried. I just feel like that has cemented in my head that everything really does have to be about her and she is just that self centred.\n\nAITA for being annoyed?? ",
