      "selftext": "So I have a situation going on with a friend and need some opinions on what to do about it. So this friend of mine is a new parent (less than a year) and I feel very strongly that they aren\u2019t doing right by their child. I feel that the child is last priority for this parent friend of mine. We will call the parent friend Max. For instance, Max is spending money on extra things for themselves every single month, but asking for money for basic necessities for the child (diapers, formula, etc) The child almost has no toys to play with. Every time Max takes the child somewhere, there are no clothes packed, hardly any diapers or wipes, and no toys for them to play with. The baby is almost a year old and is barely eating any baby food because Max is not taking the time to feed the baby. One morning while sleeping over at Max\u2019s house, the baby ate 18 oz of milk in the time span of 3 hours. I felt very strongly that something was not right about that. We were at another friends house one weekend, and Max obviously brought her baby, and the entire 48 hours we were there she touched her child maybe once. She just assumed we would care for the child, which of course we would, but it seemed very strange. Max always has the best of the best and the child lacks basic necessities most months that Max has to borrow money for. It really really bothers me to a point where I am considering not being friends with this person anymore. I want to be able to talk to them, but I am childless (experiencing fertility issues) and I feel like I almost have no place. I never want to parent shame, but I know right from wrong. And they are not doing right by their kid. I  love them both very much (max and the kid) and I want them to be better. Do I have a right to have a conversation with Max? How would I even approach that? Am I an asshole for wanting to make this known? TIA for the advice. ",
