      "selftext": "A couple of people requested an update, so here it is. Original post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h8hjjm/aitah\\_for\\_telling\\_my\\_girlfriend\\_to\\_shut\\_up\\_about/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1h8hjjm/aitah_for_telling_my_girlfriend_to_shut_up_about/)\n\nAs mentioned in my comments, Lana had lied to my parents, saying that I said she was \"too fat\" and that she had been trying hard to lose weight, but that I was refusing to do anything to help her. All of that was of course untrue.\n\nAfter reading all the comments (thanks for the all the advice) I decided that I wouldn't be apologizing for what i said, but I was willing to discuss the issue with her, instead of immediately breaking up like some suggested - even though I know she really crossed a line by lying to my parents. I think some people were under the impression that I screamed at her, this wasn't the case. I did snap, but when I said what I did I barely raised my voice. If I had screamed at her, I would apologize.\n\nIt got to yesterday evening and Lana had still not returned home. Realizing that I actually needed my car the following morning, I got my friend Mark to drive me to my parents house. I called Lana three times, but she didn't answer. Instead I sent her a text, saying that I wanted to talk, and that I'd come by my parents place soon. Turns out this was a mistake. \n\nWhen we arrived my car was nowhere to be seen and my mum said that Lana had left about 10 minutes ago. I called twice again and no answer. I was in the middle of texting her that if she didn't return my car, I'd be calling the police, when I got a notification from my doorbell camera. She was back at home, and my car was back in the driveway. All was good, or so I thought.\n\nMark drove me back home, but when I tried to get back inside, Lana had put on the inner latch on the door, so I was locked out.  After a few minutes of calling out to her to let me in, all I heard from her was \"Fuck off\". Now I was done. There would be no calm conversation, we were done. \n\nThankfully I was able to climb over the back fence (didn't think I'd make it in the shape I'm in), and get in through the back door. Once inside I told her that she had until that evening to get out. At the time she didn't even protest. She just packed a bag and a friend picked her up an hour later.\n\nThis morning she has tried calling multiple times. She's now messaging that she's sorry and wants to talk, but I'm not interested. I messaged her that I've packed all her stuff and she can get a friend to come and get it, or I'll put it outside for her to pick up, but she won't be getting in my house again.\n\nNow I'll be staying home until I can get the locks changed. I've got a financial agreement in place with her, so she's got no claim on the house or any of my property, so this should be the end of it. Again, thanks for the advice",

This was a bad situation but this is how relationships go sometimes, it\u2019s not always perfect and healthy. You have to work things out together if you truly love each other. You need to set boundaries with her and let her know she can never talk to your parents about your relationship issues again.

She handled this all wrong and the situation sucks but I think it\u2019s possible to salvage your relationship if she\u2019s willing to accept responsibility for her actions; and if she is, try to validate her feelings too and let her know that she misunderstood what you actually said.

She obviously should be the one to apologize which you said she did and she has self esteem issues that she needs to work on. Her poor self image caused her to misunderstand what you actually said to her. All she heard was her inner voice telling her she\u2019s too fat. This was a bad situation but this is how relationships go sometimes, it\u2019s not always perfect and healthy. You have to work things out together if you truly love each other. You need to set boundaries with her and let her know she can never talk to your parents about your relationship issues again. Read your original post to her so she can try to understand your perspective on things. She handled this all wrong and the situation sucks but I think it\u2019s possible to salvage your relationship if she\u2019s willing to accept responsibility for her actions; and if she is, try to validate her feelings too and let her know that she misunderstood what you actually said. As long as she\u2019s willing to address and work on her issues it\u2019s possible to make things work. No one is perfect. But I\u2019m a hopeless romantic so do what you think is best for you.</p>\n</div>",
