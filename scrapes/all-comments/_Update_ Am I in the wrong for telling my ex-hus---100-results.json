      "selftext": "A promise is a promise.\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, my ex\u2019s stepson had an altercation with him because my ex refused to let him go out. Now I have more details.\n\nMy ex\u2019s stepson had plans to go bowling with some friends. His biological father had already given him permission and money for the outing. However, when he told his mother, she said he couldn\u2019t go because they needed him to stay home and watch his younger siblings. My ex and his wife had planned an outing and needed someone to stay with the kids.\n\nThis led to an argument. The boy raised his voice to his mother, and my ex stepped in to demand that he respect her. The boy replied that he wasn\u2019t his father. Trying to maintain authority, my ex told him that as long as he lived under his roof, he had to follow his rules. The boy ignored him and turned away. My ex followed him and touched his shoulder to get his attention. At that moment, the boy turned around, punched him, and shouted that he wasn\u2019t his father and could never compare to him.\n\nThe mother scolded him for his behavior, but the boy, still angry, shouted back that he hated her.\n\nThis version was shared by my ex and his wife to my ex-mother in law. My sister in law later relayed it to me. They went to see my ex-mother-in-law to try to gain her sympathy and convince her to take care of the kids the two stepchildren and the baby  so they could go out. However, my ex-mother-in-law told them she would not take care of the children.\n\nWhen I spoke to my ex, he mentioned he was dealing with family issues and claimed that the boy\u2019s biological father was turning him against him. He didn\u2019t give me many details and omitted most of what my sister in law had shared. He simply informed me that, due to the situation, he wouldn\u2019t be able to pick up our children this weekend.\n\nThe 15-year-old boy is now staying with his biological father.\n\nAs for what I mentioned earlier, my ex was two months behind on child support, and that same week, he was supposed to make another payment. He didn\u2019t, leaving him three months behind. In the end, his mother was the one who covered the overdue amount.\n\nRegarding the child who attends the same school as my son, it\u2019s not the 15 year old involved in the altercation. It\u2019s his younger stepbrother, who is 8 years old, the same age as my son.\n\nI decided to enroll my son in that school when the affair became public. At the time, I was working as a kindergarten teacher at the same school, and the boy had been one of my students. We all knew each other, and to protect my children from rumors, I transferred them to a private school. This happened two months before the school year ended. Thanks to the circumstances and the support of some kind people, we managed to get them admitted.\n",
