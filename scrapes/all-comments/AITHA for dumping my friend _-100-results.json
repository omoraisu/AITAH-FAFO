      "selftext": "So this story took place when 2 years ago me (14 F) at the time was friends with this girl Maddie . Maddie was 14 F too and was kind of a B for some background info she would always let her friends bully me and would ghost me for no reason and whenever she was made at me would talk about a hangout or sleepover with our other friend Gabi (14 F) to make me jealous . Back to the main story we were having a sleepover when she left the room and came back 10 minutes later saying she invited Gabi over to make the sleepover less boring , I\u2019m not sure if it was bad for me to be offended by that but anyways gabi came over and her and Maddie were basically ignoring me expect for when they decided to tease me . I had enough so after the sleepover ended the next day (which in this part I may be a little bit of a AH) I sent Maddie a long paragraph ending my friendship with her , in response to it she called me a stupid bitch and now is telling everyone at school I sent her a long paragraph calling her all sorts of names which is completely twisted . She also told me In private the text was unnecessary and I was being a AH by making it that long . So am\nI the AH?\n\n\n(Please ignore spelling mistakes I made this half asleep)",
