      "selftext": "A few weeks ago I wrote to a friend I hadn't heard of for awhile. It was a regular \"How are you? How's the family? I hope everything is fine at work.\" type message. \nIt didn't take my friend long to reply and they sent me a really long message in reply, followed by a 25 minute audio message that was mostly about their work. It might be important to know that they've been working in the same job for years and nothing out of the norm had occured. So, the message was basically just an in-depth job description ending with \"Well, nothing new has happened and actually there really isn't much to say about work.\"\n\nI was overwhelmed and didn't know how to respond to a 25 minute audio message about nothing happening at work. So, I postponed answering and suddenly 5 weeks have passed without me responding. My friend is upset because it's rude not to reply to a message and my partner thinks that's an ah thing to do even though my partner also believes the audio message to be insane. \n\nAm I the asshole?",
