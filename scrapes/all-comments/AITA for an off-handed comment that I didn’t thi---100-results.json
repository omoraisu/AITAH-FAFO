      "selftext": "Ok so this happened back in October but it just popped up back in my head recently and I want this subreddit\u2019s thoughts: \n\nI (21M) went to Disney World with my brother (27M), Mother (55F) and Dad (61M) back in October, and in the Fall in the Epcot Section of Disney, they have this season long event called the Food and Wine Festival, where in the World Showcase section, there are different pop-up stands that let you order very miniature versions of food from each country.\n\nSo as backstory, I work in my university\u2019s Business School\u2019s Graduate Programs Office as a part-time student worker, doing administrative and marketing/communications/support service for them, and it\u2019s me and one other student worker there who is from India, as she came all the way from there to study for her Masters Degree in Business Analytics and be closer to some family and friends she has over here in the States.\n\nWhen we passed the India stand, I made an off handed comment about the menu poster saying \u201cgee I should send a picture of that to *student worker\u2019s name* and see if she thinks Disney did this stand right and got Indian food right* not thinking about race at all at first, since things like that have not come up at all with me and her and I just treat her like another person, as any sane person would do. \n\nMy brother then grabs my arm and pulls me off to the side of the path in Epcot and says that it wasn\u2019t nice of me to say that and in public, since not everyone who is from India is an expert on Indian food, and it wasn\u2019t great of me to assume that she would be an expert on it just because she\u2019s from India. \n\nI never ended up texting her about it but I wouldn\u2019t think to text that if she were Indian American, as then I would certainly call myself an a-hole for texting that, as she\u2019s straight up from India, grew up there and was born there, so I didn\u2019t think that texting that would be necessarily bad. \n\nSo Reddit, tell me, was I the a-hole with this?",
