      "selftext": "How do i even start. Yesterday was the one of if not the worst day i have ever expirienced. For context me and my girl have a history of going back and forth together or separate. She had multiple partners not serious thou and one semi serious. We are thogether for over 5 years. Yesterday she hung out with her college classmates and then we had a plan that i will pick her up and we will go for a ride with the car. We also got condoms. Well we initially intended to have sex and we were searching for a spot. Until we had sex everything was perfect. We had a great time and a lot of fun. However when we started having intercourse i initially got it up but when we started i couldnt hod it for long. Them she told me \"u cant hold your erection\". And as you might imagine this was the end of what we were doing. Then we gpt to the ride home. This was the worst part. We were silent a bit then she started to ask what was wrong with me because i was obviously hit by a truck. It never happened to me before. I told her that what happened deeply disturbed me. And at some point during the ride i got stopped by a cop for a routine chekup(i didnt even get tested for alcohol) and after the check she just started going on how i would have done something for them to stop me. Them we got in an argument about it and she hit me with \"why werent you able to keep it hard\". And i told her it was probbably bevause i jerk off too much(like 2 3 times a day)(i also jerked the same day 1 time). Then she was silent and stared comparing me to a college classmate of hers with the words(maybe he isnt the loser maybe you are). And this was it. I yelled at her once to shut up. And she did. I immedietly appologised and she was not talking to me. So i stopped the car and apologised to her extensively. Eventually she started talking again. I never raise my voicd to her. Never in out 5 year history i have never done anything violent like that. I was just really emotional at the moment. Them we got to her apartment i was driving her to. She forgot something in the car so i shouted but she didnt hear. Then i got out of the car but instead of stepping on the floor of the car i stepped on the pedal and the car went into a bench inront of the apartment building. Then she got back when she heard this. She stayed for a while while i tried getting out the board from the bench that was stuck in my car. She proposed calling her dad but i refused. She even started calling him but i begged her not to. Then she told me that she is cold and she is getting home. Then i told her \"I will get it done myself alone like everything else\". And thats it.\nFor clarification the day before this she went on about how she wanted to be free and how her mother told her to have fun while she is young and stuff like that. I just want het to be my wife. I love her a lot. She broke me up during the summer and always tells me that we broke up back then but when we go out she still tells me that we are \"married\" (we arent officially). She also told me about a college of hers that told her he losves her or smt like that. Ant to this moment i still feel a hole in me. Like a bug lump in my throat. I event started to stutter again(i did when i was 10 years old).\nSo do you think its worth pursuing a serious relationship with this woman?\nI thougth of it a lot and i really love her.\nAnd can i even forget this memory when we had intimacy? What do i do now with my trauma? Would i ever be able to perform during such activities? Can u suggest me any was that i solve this?",

A serious relationship shouldn\u2019t be this hard.  Although I\u2019m only working with a tiny snippet of your life, I think you both are clinging to the sunk cost fallacy.  You feel like breaking up after 5 would mean those 5 years were a waste.  They were not, and never will be, a waste. You both learned a lot, you grew up, and likely accomplished/experienced many other things outside of this relationship. \n\nYou guys are clinging to this because it\u2019s comfortable and safe - NOT because you truly love and respect each other. You may have been compatible when you started dating at 14\u2026but you\u2019ve grown up considerably, and your wants, needs, goals, and everything else, has changed.  You simply are not compatible any longer.  Your relationship is dysfunctional AF. \n\nCut the cord my dude. Go your separate ways. The pillars that normally hold up a relationship and allow it to function in a healthy, fulfilling way are long gone.  You guys are essentially friends, who aren\u2019t even sure why they\u2019re friends anymore, and who also have sex with each other. Take some time to figure out what you want. Don\u2019t put pressure on yourself to find \u201cthe one\u201d. You have plenty of life ahead of you and many more things to experience.  \n\nAnd don\u2019t put too much pressure on not staying hard. That\u2019s likely gonna happen randomly throughout your life. Stress, anxiety, environmental factors, medications, alcohol, and lots of other things can attribute to that - and yes, your jerking it frequency could also affect it.  Hopefully in the next couple years, you won\u2019t feel the urge to do it as often. If it doesn\u2019t taper off, you may want to try consciously limiting yourself. But seriously, it\u2019s not that big of a deal. It happened one time. So what. Stop putting so much pressure on yourself.  You\u2019re gonna be fine.",
