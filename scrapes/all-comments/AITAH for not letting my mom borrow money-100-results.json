      "selftext": "For a little bit of background, I (f18) joined the military to get out of home and actually do something for myself. From since I was little, my parents made it known they would not financially support me in any way, no college or anything. They ended up getting divorced when I was 13 and Ive lived with my mom till I left last summer. I didn\u2019t ask for much, whatever I wanted I worked for by getting a job after sophomore year. I don\u2019t even have a driver\u2019s license because my mom didn\u2019t want to help. Some point after I got a job, I started paying my mom roughly $100 per month. I didn\u2019t mind, I wasn\u2019t saving up for anything major. I don\u2019t have a car, i\u2019m not married, and i\u2019m going to a different country for my duty station in January. \nWhen I was going through boot camp, my mom and her boyfriend started developing problems so by November, way after I graduated boot camp, they ended up breaking up. They didn\u2019t have the best relationship, that I knew before I left but it wasn\u2019t my business. Now she\u2019s trying to move out 3 hours away from where she lived and she\u2019s asking for money. First she asked for me to request a 4 year loan and I left it at that. It just doesn\u2019t benefit me in any way. Then she asked if could simply just borrow 4k then pay it back over time. It just irks me to why she can\u2019t get a loan like that in her own name or she doesn\u2019t have anything saved up.\nIt gets complicated because the reason she is asking for money is she was on paid leave for 2 months due to medical issues and now left her job and is trying to get one 3 hours away. So she has already asking for a few hundred every once in a while, she has paid me in the past except recently because of this issue. She\u2019s been doing a lot of things recently in spur of the moment. My little brother lives with her so he\u2019s stuck with whatever is happening at home or whatever she is doing. She\u2019s even made him ask me for money. I know it\u2019s not my responsibility to take care of him just because I was smart with my money and wanted to save it. I know if I give her this money now, I\u2019ll probably not see it again and it\u2019s gonna help her habit of constantly coming to me for money. So my mom and I didn\u2019t have the best relationship. Many other people in my life expressed care or interest in how I\u2019m doing or what i\u2019m doing in my life 10x more regardless how long they\u2019ve known me despite her being there my whole life. I feel like she just sees me as an ATM at this point. ",
