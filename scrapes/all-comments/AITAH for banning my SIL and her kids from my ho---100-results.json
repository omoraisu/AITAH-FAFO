      "selftext": "Throwaway account because my SIL is on reddit. \n\nI (39F) have a grand piano that\u2019s been in my family for generations. It was originally my great-grandmother\u2019s, passed down to my grandmother, then my mother, and now me. It\u2019s a Steinway grand piano, worth more than I care to say, but its value is more sentimental than monetary. It\u2019s been lovingly cared for and holds countless memories of family gatherings, holidays, and music lessons. I\u2019ve always treated it as more than a piece of furniture\u2014it\u2019s a part of our family history.\n\nLast weekend, I hosted a family gathering, and my sister-in-law, \u201cLaura\u201d (29F), came with her two kids (6M and 4F). Her kids are a handful, to put it mildly. I made it clear when they arrived that the piano was strictly off-limits. I even put up a sign that says, \u201cDo not touch.\u201d\n\nAt some point during the party, I noticed her youngest running his hands over the keys while Laura just laughed. I told her it wasn\u2019t a toy, and she said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, he\u2019s just curious,\u201d but pulled him away. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nLater, I walked into the living room and nearly had a heart attack. Her older son was *standing on top of the piano* while Laura stood nearby, taking pictures like it was cute! I yelled at them to stop immediately, but by the time the kid got down, the damage was done. There were deep scratches all over the lid and top of the piano.\n\nI was furious. I told Laura she needed to leave, and she got defensive, saying I was being \u201cdramatic\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s just a piano.\u201d She refused to apologize and even accused me of being \u201cuptight\u201d for caring so much about an \u201cold piece of wood.\u201d\n\nThat night, I texted her to let her know she and her kids are no longer welcome in my house. She responded by calling me petty and claimed I was \u201cpunishing her kids for being kids.\u201d Some family members are on my side, saying Laura was reckless and disrespectful. Others think I\u2019m overreacting and being too harsh, saying it\u2019s just a piano and I shouldn\u2019t ban family over it.\n\nTo me, this isn\u2019t just a piano\u2014it\u2019s a part of my family\u2019s history that she let her kids ruin while she stood there laughing. AITA for banning her after this?\n\n",
