      "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nTL;DR Am I the asshole if I block my father out of my life completely? He cheated on my mom, contributed to a very traumatic divorce and childhood, although he's been helping me and my sister financially.\n\nThe long story: \n\nMy father cheated on my mom after 13 years of marriage with a colleague for reasons I will never know (quite possibly money and the fact that both of them are very controlling and potentilly narcisistic).\n\nThis happened when I was around 8 years old (sister was 5) and the whole divorce and custody process took around 3-4 years to complete. \n\nLeading up to that, he blocked the phone (it was an old analog phone) from dialing a specific character so I couldn't call his cellphone or my mom's or my grandparents (who basically raised us and lived in another city) when me and my sister were left alone at home because he was chasing his new woman and my mom was being the detective trying to find where he was. I remember spending time standing by the window watching the cars and waiting for my mom's car and worrying endlessly that no one would come back home for us.\n\nDuring this time, my parents had actual physical fights (meaning hitting each other) in front of me and my sister (who's three years younger than me). I got slapped by my father over stupid things I did but didn't know better at the time (killing a fish in our acquarium which I thought was attacking other fish and represented the woman he was cheating on my mom with). I got slapped so hard another time my glasses flew across the room. And the other time for absolutely no reason when my mom brought us to a rendevous point for our father to pick us up during a family trip with my maternal side of the family. My sister and I didn't want to go, but I guess nobody really cared about what we wanted.\n\nDuring this time, my sister and I unfortunately got involved in the custody process and had to handwrite a letter to the court saying we want to stay together (the court was trying to break us apart) and with our mom. My father threatened me and my sister that he would kill our mom if we didn't do what he says. He also forced me and my sister to sleep in his bedroom after a fight with mom and prevented us from getting out after one of such threats. \n\nOne time, after he lost the custody battle, he came home and broke all the plates and glasses in the kitchen when no one was home. I was the first person to arrive and seeing this, I was so scared I thought a thief had broken into our home, and went and stayed at a neighbor until my mom showed up.\n\nDuring the final stages of the divorce, my mom would prevent him from getting in the house by leaving the key in the lock and barring the door. But he would keep banging on the door, yelling that he's going to bring the door down while me and my sister were both being terrified of what was going to happen if he somehow managed to get in. This happened so many times, I've lost count.\n\nDuring that trip that I got slapped, after he picked us up (which really felt like kidnapping), he prevented us from contacting our mom for the entirety of the time we were forced to spend with him. Then, another time, while we were staying at my grandparents' house, he came in and tried to force us to go on a trip with him, but we were holding onto our grandparents because we didn't want to go. He kidnapped my sister who was much younger and smaller than me at the time, and even though my mom and grandfather tried to chase him to the train station, they couldn't get my sister back. He returned with her, and she was safe, but the damage was already done.\n\nAfter the divorce, we moved out and changed where we lived to the other city my grandparents lived in. But my father knew where we went to at school, and he would show up there and try to meet us. But we didn't want to meet him, and my mom was terrified that he would kidnap us again for good, so we would have to ask the principal to call our mom, tell her to come pick us up through the backdoor and hope against hope that he wouldn't see us or catch us before mom showed up. When we actually managed to get home safe, he would call us or our mom repeatedly leaving angry voicemails with lots of swearing. It was super terrifying and embarassing and it kept going on until I went to college.\n\nDuring all these years, he's been helping me and my sister financially by paying child support to my mom; and also giving me money for things (certificates, immigration, downpayment for a car loan, a safety deposit for a house I was renting, etc) which if he hadn't given me, I wouldn't have been able to afford and my mom wouldn't have been able to help me with either. In return for all of this, I have had maintained contact with him, seen him in person multiple times, and basically tried to repay some of what he's done financially by helping him and his 3rd wife when I could do something for them and they couldn't without my help.\n\nThere's a lot more to unpack here, but finally after 20 years, going to therapy for 5 years, and some other things happenening, I'm realizing that all this time I was angry and hateful toward him just for him betraying my mom and never for all the abuse and fear he made me and my sister go through. \n\nAm I the asshole if I block him out of my life completely even though he's been helping me and my sister financially?\n\nThank you for reading through this horrible column of text, and please let me know if you have any questions in the comments. I'll try my best to answer them. ",
