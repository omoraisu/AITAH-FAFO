      "selftext": "Most evenings, we\u2019ll sit on opposite ends of the couch watching TV together. She\u2019s a night owl, so she stays up late, takes the kids to school in the morning, and then goes back to bed until about 1 PM. She\u2019s a stay-at-home mom, and I work from home. I usually text her to let her know when I\u2019m heading out, whether it\u2019s to the store or my office.\n\nAt some point, the topic came up, and she mentioned that she removed me from her favorites. This means that when her phone is on Do Not Disturb, I\u2019m muted until the afternoon, but our son can always get through to her. In the mornings, the kids typically come to me for anything they need\u2014rides, food, or help\u2014because she\u2019s often sleeping. She struggles with depression and spends most of her day sleeping or watching TV until the evening, when we sit together, and she has a drink while we watch TV.\n\nI feel like we\u2019re more like platonic roommates at this point, married on paper because we can\u2019t afford to separate. If that\u2019s the case, I feel like she should contribute financially, especially toward her own credit card bills\u2014but that\u2019s another conversation.\n\nWhen she told me I\u2019d been removed from her favorites, it hit me hard. Logically, I get it, but emotionally, it feels like she sees me as an annoyance if I need to contact her. I\u2019m not sure if this feeling is valid or if it\u2019s just the years of loneliness catching up to me, making this another blow to my self-esteem.\n\nI guess what I\u2019m wondering is: should I just let it go? I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get over it soon enough. I\u2019ve learned to suppress my feelings until they build up too much pressure. Or should I explain to her why I made a big deal about it when she mentioned it so matter-of-factly?",
