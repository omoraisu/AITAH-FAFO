      "selftext": "I have a genuine question: should living with your partner feel better than living alone? Because it doesn\u2019t feel this way for me and idk if IATAH.\nMe (24F) and my BF (32 M) lived together for a 1y, but we had many arguments and I decided to break up with him and move out. After a month we reconsidered the relationship, started couples therapy and things kinda are better now. But we didnt move back in. It\u2019s been 2 months since then. I do stay over his apartment about 2-3 days a week and commute to work. But recently it feels like a burdain to go over his place. \n\nWhen we lived together it was rough for me because I had to commute daily to the office for 2h. He lives 1 min away from his workplace. Besides having to commute there are multiple other disadvantages: I am far away from parents and my old and sick grandma which I love deeply and really care about. All my friends are in my hometown. I get my much needed alone time which I dont really have access to when living together cause there is always sth i have to do (shopping, cook, clean, run errands, go to the gym with him - thats goes to the \u201chave to\u201d pile cause i hate the gym but he is a gym freak that wants his gf working out to build a ass haha). When I live alone I can stay up as much as I want to or get up as early as I want to whereas when we live together it always has to be at the same time - usually the time he decides. I miss him more and overall my feelings towards him are positive when away because he is quite clingy and suffocating. I can dress as I please when going to work, when we lived together if I was too dressy he would make comments about it until I would feel bad and change just to avoid a argument. Same with makeup. Also the home conditions at my place overall are better because we lived together in a rented apartment that he doesn't want us to move out of. I have time to read, watch my TV shows or just lay in bed when I want without announcing before that I wont be spending some time with him. \n\nThere are more but these are the ones that are most important for me atm. Our therapist suggested we set a date/period for the time we\u2019ll move back together to ensure stability and security in the relationship. He asked me a few times when I think I will be ready to move back in. I never had a response and I am starting to feel like a impostor to this relationship. I just don\u2019t want to move back in. And I don\u2019t know how to adress the reasons behind it because this will sound stupid. I feel like I sound childish and stupid. Some opinions might help me.. How do I say this to him and the therapist?\n\nAITAH for not wanting to live together with my SO? \n\n",

At this point, there is little to no upside to moving back in with him.  Really, why is the upside to having a relationship with this guy at all?  He's not interested in making you happy, otherwise he'd be more flexible and less controlling.  Imagine trying to live the rest of your life away from your family, catering to a guy who determines when you sleep, how you dress, expects you do to the shopping, etc?  Is this how you want to live your life?  If not, why are you still in the relationship?",
