      "selftext": "Context I, F(39) was invited to a lunch at an auntie house. My whole family would be gathering there and we made the effort to go, despite being at the other end of the country. Me and hubby M(41) and our daughter (2) were making preparations the day before when I got a text from my dad saying the lunch was being moved to my cousin's house because we were too many people and his house is bigger. I started getting uncomfortable but I decided it would be ok. \n\nI had never went to my cousin's house and it's been a while we've seen each other. I should mention when we were little, he is 2 yrs older, he would grab me and feel my behind and it was really uncomfortable. I think he was 12 and I was 10. It went on for a while and although it never went beyond that I really hated it. My husband knows about this and he was reluctant but I put it behind me and we went anyway. \n\nWe went and everything was fine, my cousin is married to his high school sweetheart and they have 2 kids, the food was great, the environment was great until I realised how much my husband and cousin were getting along. Seems they've many hobbies in common and they were so interested in talking about it that my husband seemed to forget about what I told him. \nFast forward to later that evening he told me they made plans for an online gaming session to which I completely flipped. I told him I didn't want him hanging out with my cousin and that he was not being supportive. \nI first asked that of him in a very polite manner but I also realised I've lost my shit when he told me he asked my cousin about what happened when we were kids and that my cousin told him he never thought too much of that and that it was just kids being kids. My cousin told my husband we even had so a few kisses and that he thought it was just us exploring and that he never sexualised it beyond that. He asked my husband if he and I should speak about it and that in his mind he wasn't doing anything against my will. \nI completely lost it at this point because I never meant to kiss my cousin or let him feel me in anyway. \nTo make it worse my husband said I was making it sound worse than I should and that if it was that bad that I should clear it with my cousin. Is it so bad to ask him to simply drop being so nice to my cousin? \nAITAH here? ",
