      "selftext": "Sorry for any spelling or grammar error as I am still trying to calm down\n\nI 29 f am married to 31 m we have a six month old\n\nMy son who is not biologicaly his child  we had separated for six month when he wanted to get back together I informed him I was pregnant and that he needed to really consider his choice as I was now a package deal he was happy to have a baby as we never had a physical relationship he is A sexual i have a low drive me wanting a child is why we broke up in the first place \n\nHe was vary happy and accepted instantly and was vary excited to be a father saying he didn't care where his blood came from he would be his child \n\nThis is relevant \n\nToday we have been preparing to visit his parents in Japan in 2 day \n\nI offered to pick up stuff to make him lunch cause I had to cut a spare key for neighbor will call her L to house sit for us (I had mentioned yhis many times before he never disagreed) \n\nHe started getting upset saying he doesn't trust and it's not normal to have someone have key and check on your house when your gone \n\nI explained it is normal when your gone for more then 2 weeks (we will be gone for a month month) \n\nHe started yelling at me cussing ext \n\nI offered if he didn't want my friend maybe we could give to his friend \n\nHe's screaming at me calling me all sorts of names calling my friends name telling me I have low iq all my friends are loosers that he's canceling the trip\n\nI ask him why he needed to over react and throw a fit like a five year old and if he continued I'd ask him to leave \n\nHe called me crazy and said you should just suicide (his English isn't great for him this is kill yourself) and that i should just die because I am looser \n\nI told him to get the f out I was screaming he told me I was crazy I told him im telling his mom and it's the last straw (he always has short temper and says bad things but this was the worst thing he had ever said to me knowing I tried to kill myself in 2022 and almost died of a kindey infection in 2023 and was present with me at the time I have bipolar disporder) \n\nWhen I said I was telling his mom he told me to tell her our son we will xall hi b is another man's child \n\nMuch more was said but ultimately he left my friend who like next door came up because I texted her and I told her that I can't forgive him for this and she's like right now, telling me that we both just need to calm down honestly, in my mind, I don't think there's any coming back from this. I don't want to come back from this.I kept forget what he said to me\n\nBut like she was telling me, I needed to calm down and me and him could talk later. It just made me feel like I was crazy for thinking that this was a good enough reason to get a divorce \n\nHe always has bad temper and lately, it's been so bad. No I was literally that I have like consistent anxiety when I'm around him, and sometimes it's to the point where my chest hurts and I almost feel like I'm having a panic attack\n\n so aitah for thinking I can't be with him anymore all of this was said and done in front of the baby \n\nI pay 90% of bills i pay support him while he's in school  I really don't think I deserve this even his mother was shock ",

You should never be afraid of your partner. </p>\n\n<p>Even if he isn\u2019t physically abusive to you, he\u2019s obviously verbally, emotionally and mentally abusive. And it shows he doesn\u2019t even have the decency to do it away from your child. You are right to be worried about your son witnessing that behaviour.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most awful things to see is your child grow up to be just like your abuser. To see them mimic that behaviour. And nothing will break you worse than the day your son starts treating you like that. The day your son yells at you and tells you to end it.\nEnd this relationship and find your son a good father, before he turn out just like your bf.</p>\n\n<p>Btw your biggest tell of how awful a relationship you\u2019re in should be that you\u2019re afraid of your child being anything like your partner.</p>\n</div>",
