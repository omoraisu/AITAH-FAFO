      "selftext": "My girlfriend left Friday afternoon, got back this morning. She took a short trip to stay with a friend, get her hair done, and all that jazz. She got back and we did our Sunday routine. Tonight she expressed she was upset that I wasn\u2019t more excited when she got home. \n\nWe\u2019ve been together 3 years. I was happy to see her. I just don\u2019t jump up and down like others might. She said she wished that I missed her more and I asked some questions to understand her thinking. \n\nDo people really want to feel missed? I asked her \u201cisn\u2019t it kind of odd to want people to miss you?\u201d I don\u2019t think about things like that, so maybe my question was rude. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m the asshole, but deep down I don\u2019t think I should be. Any input would be welcome on any subject. Just deep in thought. ",
