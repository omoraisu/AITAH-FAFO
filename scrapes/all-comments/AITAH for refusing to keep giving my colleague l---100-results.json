      "selftext": "AITA for refusing to keep giving my colleague lifts home after she started treating me like her personal chauffeur?\n\nI live in England and work as a project manager for a tech company. My job often requires late nights, and so does the job of one of my colleagues, who I\u2019ll call Emma (not her real name). We\u2019ve always gotten along well, and I\u2019ve been happy to help her out when I can. A couple of months ago, Emma mentioned she was nervous about taking public transport late at night after a particularly scary incident where someone followed her from the bus stop.\n\nI felt for her and offered to give her a lift home whenever we finished late, as her flat is only about 15 minutes out of my way. At first, this was fine\u2014she was really grateful, and I was happy knowing she was getting home safe.\n\nBut over time, things started to feel\u2026 off. For one, Emma began expecting the lift rather than asking. She\u2019d linger around the office waiting for me instead of heading out, and if I tried to leave without her, she\u2019d make comments like, \u201cOh, I guess chivalry really is dead.\u201d\n\nThen she started pushing it further. She\u2019d ask me to make detours to pick up things for her or drop her off at places other than her home. For example, she once asked me to stop at a 24-hour shop so she could \u201cgrab a few essentials,\u201d which turned into a 20-minute wait in the car. Another time, she asked me to drop her at her friend\u2019s place instead of her flat, which added an extra 30 minutes to my journey.\n\nWhen I gently told her I couldn\u2019t keep doing this because it was adding to my already long days, she got defensive. She said I was being selfish and implied I didn\u2019t care about her safety. She even made a snide remark about how she\u2019d \u201cfind someone who actually cared.\u201d\n\nI\u2019ve now stopped offering her lifts altogether. She\u2019s been giving me the cold shoulder at work and has even told some of our colleagues that I \u201cabandoned\u201d her late at night. A few people have said I should\u2019ve just put up with it for the sake of workplace harmony, but others agree she was taking advantage.\n\nI feel bad because I know the world isn\u2019t always safe for women, especially late at night, but I also feel like I was being taken for granted.\n\nAITAH?",
