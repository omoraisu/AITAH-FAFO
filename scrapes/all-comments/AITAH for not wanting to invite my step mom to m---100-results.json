      "selftext": "Hi everyone - I am looking for advice/feedback for a situation I am dealing with. Here\u2019s some backstory of my situation.\n\nI (24F) have had divorced parents for about 20+ years. My dad (60M) has been remarried to my step mom (58F) for about 14 years now. In the beginning we had a decent relationship when she didn\u2019t live with my sister, Dad, and I. After we all moved in together things got really rocky. She treated me very unfairly compared to her son, my step brother, and would constantly \u201ctattle tale\u201d on me when I refused to do something for her as a child. As I got older and went through my own mental health issues and struggles, she never was a support person for me. She tells everyone now, that she feels as if she did  something for me by praying that God would find a way to heal me. I don\u2019t personally believe in religion too much, but through years or therapy and medication, I definitely over came those struggles. She continues to share with others about her own struggles through life but does not openly want to help others in life with their own.\n\nWhen I became 18, I was thankful for becoming an adult because as I no longer needed to respect her. I refused to go her family things, and be there for her family no matter what because her family was never good to me. I have family members of her physically/verbally assault me, because that was a normal bringing up for them. Fast forward to now, my dad has shared with my multiple times that he is miserable in the marriage and wants to divorce badly. His fear with doing so is paying spousal support and losing everything he has since she has nothing without him. She is very greedy and selfish, and doesn\u2019t care about my dad\u2019s feelings. My dad recently told me he has been the worse he has been mentally for years, and I am starting to grow concerned. I work in the psychology field, and know the dangers of males being at a standstill in their mental health. My dad has tried to open up to her, but she shuts his issues down and tells him she had it worse.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I are due to get married in March in 2025. It\u2019s not a huge wedding due to personal issues, but we don\u2019t want to invite that many people. My step mom has never been a good person to me, and I always told myself growing up, I want true supporters at my wedding, which she is not. I mentioned to my dad that I personally would not like her to come, but my dad told me I should invite her so she doesn\u2019t take it out on him. But in the end it\u2019s me and my finances wedding and we get to decide. My fianc\u00e9 is also on board with me and respects my decision on what I would prefer to do. She also typically likes to turn other peoples events into her own sad story or about her wedding with my dad from years ago, and I don\u2019t really think I need to explain that boundary to someone in theirs 50s to be quite honest\u2026\n\nAITAH if I tell her she cannot come? Looking for advice as I feel passionate about what I want to do but don\u2019t want to come off AH\u2026",
