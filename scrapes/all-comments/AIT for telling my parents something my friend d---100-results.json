      "selftext": "I've told this story in a few other subreddits, but I'm gonna tell it here.\n\nI had this friend since high school, let's call him Zero. He was one of my greatest friends. He was always there for me when I needed him, and he got along great with my family as well. We had a lot in common. We did everything together; go to each other's houses, to the mall, the movies, restaurants, anything you can think of. I thought of him as an older brother, even though I have a brother who's younger than me already. We'd be here all day with me talking about all the stuff we'd do together, but the best way I can describe it is that he was someone important to me.\n\nHowever, in October 2022 (I was 18), my mom came into my room and told me that Zero told her he has a crush on me. My mom asked me if I ever wanted to date him in the future, and I said no because I just wanted to stay as friends.\n\nFast forward six months-ish later, Zero tells me that he thinks my mom is pushing us to be a couple. I did not believe that for one minute, as I know my mom. Never has she expected me to date a guy, especially since I was barely in college at the time. He then told me he'd rather I not speak about it to my parents. I told him I had to, as I had to find out if this was true. He said, \"I wouldn't recommend it.\". I should also note that Zero had a girlfriend at that time, so I don't know why he said anything like that.\n\nOne day, I went out for a walk with my mom, and told her what Zero told me. She said, \"Seriously? I never said anything like that. He's lying. I would never force a boy on you.\". She then brought up the fact that Zero told her he has a crush on me. Apparently he texted her about it, so with mom's permission, I viewed the text messages. None of them indicated that my mom was forcing us to be a couple. She was just very open about it, saying things like, \"Oh, I don't mind if you date her. But these are the rules you need to follow. Don't be out past 10 PM, tell us where you're going when you're going out, etc.\". Just her being accepting of the fact that Zero had feelings for me, but also setting some ground rules in case we ever did become an item.\n\nFast forward a week, I tell Zero, \"Hey, I told mom about what you said. But could you at least provide me some proof about your claim? Not calling you a liar.\". He then answers, \"So let me get this straight. You ignored my feelings and now you want me to help you? Some friend you are. I'm no tool so I don't enjoy being used. Don't contact me again. Goodbye.\". I didn't want to lose him, so I immediately apologized for telling my mom. He then accepted it, and said, \"But because of what you did, you've put me in a tough position with your parents, so I'm not coming over anymore. We can only be friends virtually.\".\n\nI went with it because part of me thought he was going to eventually change his mind and see me IRL again. I've brought it back up a few times, and again, he's said he can't bring himself to see me. Try as I might, he never budged on seeing me again. I did everything you can think; assuring him there is no tension, my parents have nothing against him, we would love to welcome him again. But no. I even asked my dad to call him and talk to him, but dad told me, unsurprisngly, Zero never answered him. (To clarify, he just didn't want to see my parents, not exactly me)\n\nOne day, I got the courage to tell Zero everything I felt; I was sick of the distance, I just wanted him to understand that there is nothing wrong among us, my parents miss him and would love to see him again. I missed the way things used to be. I wanted what we had back then. He acted like he understood my feelings, but said things like, \"Well, I'm embarrassed. Normal embarrassment I can get over, but this, I can't. It's hard to explain, but it's an abstract concept lalala\". \"You just have to accept that this is something not under any of our control, at least for now\".\n\nI went along for a few more months or so, hoping he would change his mind. He got himself a few more significant others with whom he broke up with, and last year he moved in with another girlfriend (I think they're still dating today but idk). Eventually my breaking point hit. I just couldn't wait any longer. The friendship just wasn't what it used to be anymore.\n\nI sent him message saying that this kind of friendship is no longer sustainable for me, and that it's best we go our separate ways. He accepted, and we ended things with peace. At least it was much calmer than his attempt to cut me off the previous year.\n\nMy parents say that just because Zero didn't want to visit me anymore doesn't mean I had to end things with him. He was still my friend, no matter what the distance was between us. But my other friends tell me that Zero was being stupid. They say he lied about the whole \"mom pushing us to be a couple' thing just so he could make me his girlfriend. However, given the fact that he had a girlfriend himself at the time of claiming it, I don't know. He did end up breaking up with that girlfriend because she was controlling or something, but he did say at one point he gave up on the crush on me. And he got defensive when I asked him for proof on his claim, which wasn't like him at all. I don't think he wanted me to be his girlfriend, but at the same time, I really don't know why he brought it up in the first place. So I don't know. AITA?\n",
