      "selftext": "For context, I\u2019m a 17 year old hijabi girl and my friend, let\u2019s call her Maya, was also 17\nbut she isn\u2019t Muslim. She has a predominantly male following. This information will be important later on. Me and Maya have been friends for 6 years. She understands what the hijab means to me. Being a hijabi means that I always have to be covered around people who aren\u2019t my immediate family. This means that I keep my arms and legs covered, and don\u2019t wear clothes that give my body shape away. \n\nMe and Maya were comfortable enough that she\u2019s seen me without my hijab and in clothes that aren\u2019t fully modest. I don\u2019t ever wear these clothes out or post in them. I always send her pictures of me wearing them and she hypes me up. One day, I was wearing a body con dress and a cropped sweater and I sent her a picture of it. She said it was cute and told me to post it on my story. Ofc, I said no. She kept pushing me and I got upset about it and told her that she was being ignorant towards my religion. She backed off. After that, I went to bed to cool off. I woke up the next morning and when I checked Instagram, I see that she posted that picture of me on her public story. She has about 12k followers and more than half are guys. When I checked my requests, I had several requests from men. For people who don\u2019t understand the gravity of this situation, it\u2019s like if you sent your boyfriend nudes and he posted them on his story. I told her to take the story down and she refused. I begged her and told her that it was a matter of my dignity. She didn\u2019t care. She never deleted the story. At this point, I lost all my trust for her. I ended our friendship. I can\u2019t be friends with someone who would disrespect me like that. I told a couple of my friends about what happened and they had mixed responses about the situation. So I\u2019m turning to Reddit. \nAITAH? ",
