      "selftext": "I\u2019ll keep this as short as I can.\n\n- I (f30) come from a very small town, my mum is a functioning junkie and has severe mental illness she refuses to address.\n- so much so, I, being an adult, am still going to therapy to try and work out my issues from childhood (I have CPTSD and BPD)\n- I have a bother very close in age to me with Autism, he\u2019s such a lovely guy and I love him - but he\u2019s extremely awkward (which is not his fault) but is also morbidly obese (has been since we were teens - to be honest I was bullied a lot growing because of the way he looked and acted, but I never said anything) \n- my other brother is an alcoholic who tends to pick fights with people and we don\u2019t speak regularly \n\n- my mum\u2019s boyfriend (I don\u2019t speak to my father) is very strange and only eats mash potatoes. I\u2019m not kidding. Only mash potato. No other food. \n\n- on top on this my mum is a total attention seeker and narcissist, she\u2019ll take any chance she can to talk about her self and she\u2019ll try and make everything about her. If you have a headache, she\u2019s got a brain tumour.. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\n- My partner (m30) comes from a perfect family, no trauma, no divorce, everyone is normal, behaves appropriately, and appears to have a functioning frontal lobe \n\n- he also has a large family, so all his cousins, aunts, uncles, nephews and so on will be at the wedding.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014-\n\nSo I\u2019m shit scared basically at how his family is going to see mine, and I\u2019m really worried I\u2019m going to spend the whole day thinking \u201coh god, what are they saying about such and such\u201d.\nI know it seems shallow to be so concerned and I\u2019ve tried radical acceptance, but the worry isn\u2019t going away!!
