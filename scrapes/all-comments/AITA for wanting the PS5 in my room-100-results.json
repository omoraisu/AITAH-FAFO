      "selftext": "I (16 f), love playing games on the PS4 my parents got for the whole house a few years ago. When we first got it, we all loved playing it together because we played a remake of an old game we loved from ps2. It stayed in our living room then.\n\nFast forward to now, mostly only me and my brother play it. So it either stays in my room (that I share with my sister) or my brothers room. But seriously I play it mostly, spending my hard earned money to get new games and stuff. \n\nI just recently found out I am getting a PS5 for Christmas from a relative. As a gamer, this makes me really excited and I stated that it should reside in my room, and my brother can have the PS4 in his room. When I first said that only to my sister, she said no, even though she knows mostly me and my brother play the game anyway. Then tonight, I said it should stay in my room and my parents just started opposing me. Saying that they all wanna play the game suddenly, but it's been here for years and you haven't played it in about a year anyway.  \n\nI tried to tell them maybe we could move it into the living room for when we all want to play together but they again opposed, and made it seem like I was in the wrong and selfish. But seriously, am I wrong?",

Ultimately parents are allowed (legally!) to be unreasonable. Why not just agree to it being in the living room for now? Your stated reason - they haven't played in a year - only applies to the PS4, not the new PS5.",
