      "selftext": "I rather spontaneously found myself taking responsibility for an abandoned cat recently. It was pretty unexpected for literally everyone - coworkers, family, partner - even myself. I don't have permission for a cat from my landlord so it's a bit hush-hush, I didn't even have a litter tray, and I have centered my entire life around my birds. Also my partner despises cats, with a passion. Made a whole song and dance about how the only good cat is a dead cat. My partner and I don't live together, for other reasons (namely that he's burnt out and refuses to seek help that's not me, and also that he breaks up with me every other day and then pretends he didn't).\n\nWhile I've had cats my whole life, it is kinda probationary, depending on how it plays out with the birds. Short term everyone is safe, fed, and happy, I can always find cat a home later on that fits better if necessary.\n\nThing is, partner has done a 180 on cats. Found a love for this one that hasn't existed for our feline friends before. Most people would find that a good thing, but he's started saying how *he* wants to adopt the cat and have something always there when he gets home from work, how a purring lap cat would help his mental health etc. And I'm not saying he's wrong for wanting that necessarily - but this cat isn't currently a lap cat, it might never *be* a lap cat, and cats also don't offer unconditional love and affection, which is what I think he might be after.\n\nAdditionally, he doesn't do any of the feeding or cleaning up after it. Which is fine, the cat is my responsibility after all. But if he adopted it, or claimed ownership of it instead me, I feel like he'd just expect me to do all of that but at his house, for him. And that doesn't sit well with me if I'm being honest.\n\nI tried to broach this with him, suggesting the cat may not be what he envisions, and that it costs money to feed, and take to the vet, and worm and treat for fleas. His rebuttal was that all of that is sorted at adoption, even though I said it's ongoing which he shrugged off and asked how I would afford it then. Right now, I think he just sees it as fun play time, not a 15-20 year commitment.\n\n**WIBTA if I just didn't let him take possession of the cat and either kept it for myself or found it a more appropriate home?** ",
