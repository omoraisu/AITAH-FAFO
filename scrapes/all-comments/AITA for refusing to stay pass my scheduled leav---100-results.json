      "selftext": "I'm a daycare teacher and my shift usually starts at 7am. Once a week I leave early at 1pm. It goes like that for anyone who starts their shift at 6:30am or 7am. Today I was scheduled to leave at 1 and usually I don't take lunch to work on my early days. I should mention that I can't go hours and hours without eating. It causes me to get weak almost fast and easily, which could also effect my work performance. I work in the 2yr olds room along with another co worker.\n\nYesterday I was scheduled to leave at 1 and usually I don't take lunch to work on my early days. I should mention that I can't go hours and hours without eating. It causes me to get weak almost fast and easily, which could also effect my work performance. I work in the 2yr olds room along with another co worker. \n\nOne of the teachers who works in the 3yr olds room came into my room asking me to stay pass 1 so that he could leave to meet his wife and child at his child's doctor's appointment so that his wife could make it to her job on time. I told him that I wouldn't be able to since I didn't bring in lunch and I didn't have any money to go buy anything. I don't get paid until this upcoming Wednesday. He didn't like my answer so he tried to argue with me by saying that I was kind of being selfish and accused me of being the reason why his wife would have to miss work and get in trouble by her boss. I apologized and told him that I can't stay here full time today(yesterday) and not be able to eat for hours. He walked off upset. Luckily, another teacher who was also scheduled to leave early yesterday decided to stay so that he could leave early and one of the floaters who usually comes in at 1 was able to cover for his class instead. But I just want to know if I was wrong?\n",
