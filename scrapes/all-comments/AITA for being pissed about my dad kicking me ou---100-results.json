      "selftext": "\nI turned 18 today and my dad decided to kick me out as my reward?\n\nNow I\u2019m living in my fuckin car.\n\nI don\u2019t have no money saved up, not a dime. Why? Cause my dad wouldn\u2019t let me get a job, I have no friends because my family is ultra religious.  I didn\u2019t even think I\u2019d need to save for this situation.\n\nWhen I asked him why he\u2019s doing this, he said, \u201cYou\u2019re an adult now, time to grow up.\u201d How am I supposed to grow up when you\u2019ve controlled every damn thing? \n\nAnd the worst part? Right after he punched me and yelled at me because he found out a secret of mine-he\u2019s now\u2019s acting like this is some kind of favor to me. Telling family I need to \u201clearn responsibility.\u201d Yeah, I\u2019m trying to learn responsibility alright\u2014right after you left me with nothing.\n\nNow I\u2019m parked in some random parking lot trying to figure out where I\u2019m gonna go next. \n\n\nEdit- the main reason I was kicked out is because I came out as gay to my sister and I guess she told them, that\u2019s the big reason. I don\u2019t really want to explain more . It makes me really uncomfortable ",
