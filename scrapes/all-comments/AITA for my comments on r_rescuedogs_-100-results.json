      "selftext": "\nSo basically, I only made this reddit account because I was looking up dog rescues in my area, and I then stumbled across r/rescuedogs. I saw 2 dogs on there that really stuck out to me, so I commented on both posts (from different posters) asking if the dogs were still available\n\nPost 1 that I commented on https://www.reddit.com/r/rescuedogs/comments/1h4ewfy/we_need_someone_to_take_this_guy_soon_found/\n\nPost 2 https://www.reddit.com/r/rescuedogs/comments/1h4nhjj/adoptionrehoming_stray_advice_tx/\n\nBoth users seemed friendly and both told me to dm them. I tried, but it wasn't working. Maybe because my account was brand new? I explained to both that I could not dm them for some reason, and they reassured me that it was fine and said they dmed me instead. However, I still could not see their messages\ud83d\ude2d during this time, I went down a sort of rabbit hole in r/rescuedogs and was saddened to see just how many dogs were being euthanized each day. I commented on a few other posts, like on one I said \"Oh no! I would take her but I'm in NC. Praying he gets a good home soon\" and on another post I asked if the dog was still alive. (luckily she was adopted before she was euthanized\u2764\ufe0f) For whatever reason, after I had made these comments, I heard back from the OP of the second post. I had just told this OP about how i still didn't see their message, they responded \" No worries, NC is too far and I don't think you are serious anyways\" I was slightly taken aback, but I understood, after all, I couldn't drive to Texas, especially during the holidays, so why should I expect them to? I deleted my comments inquiring about the dog in post 2 so the other person I had contacted in post 1 would know that I was only interested in their dog, and that the other one was not an option anymore. However, I started to get annoyed when OP of post 2 went so far as to talk to me on post 1. Post 2 OP said \"What are you trying to do here? You have commented on multiple posts, including mine, and then deleted your comments when called out\" by now I was getting a little bewildered and annoyed, so I asked them \"what did you call me out on?\" They did not respond, so I then went back to their post and under their comment saying \" No worries, NC is too far and I don't think you are serious anyways\" I asked \"why not just say that in the first place then?\" They replied saying \"What are you even replying to?\" I then tried to clarify \"I was wondering why you said \"dm me\" when I first inquired about the dog, if NC was too far. Why not just tell me you couldn't drive that far? Also, what implied that i wasn't serious?\" Post 2 OP then replied \"You need to seriously stop fucking around and quit messaging me. You know exactly what you did. Stop\" They have not said anything to me since, and I'm fine with that I tried to not take it too seriously (we are just online after all) but I feel like I am missing something about what happened. Am I really the AH? Idk what I did! Please lmk in the comments",
