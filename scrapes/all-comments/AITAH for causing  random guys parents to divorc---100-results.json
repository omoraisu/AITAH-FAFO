      "selftext": "I am F20 and this story for brought up recently at thanksgiving dinner and my siblings and cousins suggested I do a post asking reddit what they think. This story happened a few months before covid it was September of 2019 and I was going into my freshman year of high school. My dad had recently got a new job so we had to move from Oregon to Oklahoma for a year. I was already nervous being the new girl in a new school in an entirely new state, I knew zero people apart from my parents are my two brother (10 and 12 at the time). \n\nI tried to be one of those mysterious new girls because I had a weird obsession with twilight so I completely changed my personality to try and make friends with people. On my first day I was in the bathroom and this girl Michelle (fake name) started talking to me and saying she liked my scrunchies (This was peak vsco girl era). We got to talking and eventually asked me to hang out with her friends. Everyone here already kinda knew eachother from growing up in the same neighbourhoods and attending the same middle schools. I was lowkey kind of nervous but played it off and just tried to act like a cool girl. Idk if anyone here has ever watched skins but it\u2019s this British show and there\u2019s a character called Effy so I tried acting like her.\n\nShe introduced me to her friend group I\u2019m going to use fake names for privacy reasons. Derek, Hunter, Sarah and Bartholomew. He is called bartholomew in the story because he\u2019s a disgusting guy and needs a disgusting name no offence to the Bartholomew out there. Bartholomew starts talking about how his older brother Bartholomias was invited to a frat party and said he could bring a few people and judging by Bartholomew he seemed like the type of guy who would go off doing shiz like that at a young age kinda like that one little kid from Euphoria. Anyway I somehow get invited and when I got home I asked my parents if I could go. My 15 year old self obviously lied and said I was going to the movies with my new school friend. They said I could go so Bartholomew and his older brother took me, Michelle and a few others in his truck.\n\nOne we arrived I couldn\u2019t help but judge. It was a fairly big house but it was just a mess. There were random bottles of beer lying on the front lawn and one of the front windows was smashed. We walked in and there was about 50-60 ish people there and this was all new to me I hadn\u2019t even had my first sip of alcohol yet. After 30 minutes Me, Michelle, Derek, Bartholomew, Bartholomias and Bartholomias\u2019 older friends are sat in the living room and the older college kids are visibly drunk and one of them pulls out a j0int. \n\nIt gets passed around and everyone has a puff including the kids in my grade. I\u2019m the last person and I\u2019m trying to act cool but I have no idea what to say or do I\u2019ve never smoked anything before. One of Bartholomias\u2019 girlfriends comes over and teaches me how to smoke and inhale. After 2 minutes me, Michelle, Derek and Bartholomew notice Bartholomias and his friends are all acting super weird apart from the 2 that didn\u2019t smoke and they are sat there dying with laughter. \n\nI was the one to ask why they were laughing and Bartholomias\u2019 Minion number one blurts out \u201cThese freshmen just straight up smoked salvia\u201d and minion number two says \u201cThey are like 12 they\u2019re gonna die\u201d I am obviously confused to I google salvia as I\u2019ve never heard of it before. \n\nAs soon as I read it and watched a video about it I felt my heart start racing. It had been about 3 minutes since I had a puff and I was freaking out. What I forgot to mention is I am severely lactose intolerant and I had a homemade cheesecake that my Grandma made for my Dads birthday which was 2 days prior. This will become relevant later.\n\nI start wondering if or when it will kick in and as soon as I close my eyes I open them back up and it\u2019s like a ringing in my ear. Nothing will ever beat this experience this is quite possibly the worst thing that can happen to a human.\n\nI opened my eyes to see I was like on the ground unable to move in a kitchen of a restaurant. I can\u2019t talk or movie it doesn\u2019t even feel like i\u2019m breathing. Sometimes I see myself in third person sometimes it\u2019s first person. The only thing I know is I am a piece of garlic bread that has been left on the floor. My trip lasted for 1 year 1/2. When I came out of this weird trance I realised that it was in fact only about 9 minutes. I thought I was still tripping because everyone in the room was staring at me there was even more than before (15 ish people). Not only are they staring but they look shocked and horrified. The only thing I can blurt out is \u201cWhy the stare?\u201d \n\nI take a glance around the room and notice there seems to be some rather large stains on the floor and couch, Even a small amount on the ceiling. I look down and to my surprised I am absolutely horrified to see that I have popped my pants. But this was not just poop. This was a whole other level. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t brown it was almost a yellow colour it was runny and watery and worst of all it was everywhere.\n\nThe smell.\n\nThe.\n\nSmell.\n\nOnce I realised what happened my eyes filled up with tears and I look at Michelle and she just looks terrified. I then take a look at Bartholomew.\n\nHe was recording and STILL recording me.\n\nI try and ask him if he could please stop recording me and delete the video and to my surprise he said no. I then hear a snicker of laughter coming from Bartholomias. And that triggered everyone else to start laughing.\n\nI was mortified. \n\nThe only thing I can do is cry. But it gets so so much worse. I asked them what was going on and explain to them that I was a garlic bread for almost 2 years and that just causes them to erupt into more laughter which causes me to cry even more. Everyone is afraid to move and get covered in my monstrous pile of poop so when Bartholomew shows me the video the only word I can think of to explain how I felt was flabbergasted. \n\nI want you to all imagine a 15 year old girl sat on a green couch with her legs crossed like a Thai Monk chanting, \u201cgarlic bread garlic bread garlic bread\u201d. And once again\u2026 It gets worse.\n\nMy lactose intolerance kicks in at this moment and I start aggressively shitting myself whilst grunting and moaning from the shit pouring out of me. So now imagine this with the shit sounds. \n\n\u201cgarlicccuhhhhhh garlic bread eee ooo garlic bread *fart sound* garlic bread garlic bread *wet fart sound* garlic bre- *Diarrhoea fart sound* bread garlic bread *shit squirting out like a machine gun* garlic bread *belly rumbling sound* garlic *pause* *earthquake sounding shit that lasted exactly 12 seconds*\u201d \n\nThat is the only recreation I can think of to make. Just as I thought this nightmare was nearly over everyone starts laughing even harder whilst also shouting \u201cewwww\u201d I then get informed that Bartholomew has put this on his snapchat story. \n\nKill me now.\n\nEventually a very kind girl I think her name was Ava or Eva she deserves a shout out she sacrifices herself to try and help me up. Unfortunately, My confused and lowkey still tripping self stands up for exactly 2 seconds and passes out. As I pass out I slip on my own shit and land in a pile/puddle of my own wet and somehow solid shit. The shit splatters everywhere. Including into a dudes mouth as he was yawning.\n\nBefore you all start asking how this happened again someone was recording it wasn\u2019t Bartholomew but some random frat guy. \n\nEveryone starts laughing as yawning guy starts screaming and he eventually throws up. The combined smell and sight of the shit and vomit causes another guy to throw up. Which eventually creates a domino effect and exactly 9 people throw up and 6 leave the room from feeling nauseous. Ava/Eva Picks up my phone and uses face ID to get in and call my parents to pick me up. \n\nAs you can imagine they were not pleased with me.\n\nI have a long shower and bath and then sleep for about 16 hours and have a long and serious talk with my parents. Not only did I absolutely embarrass myself at my first ever party BUT\u2026\n\nThe frat boy who lived in the party house lived there with his parents and he threw the party when they were out of town. Apparently the family was already having problems but when they returned home to see that their house was absolutely destroyed and also cover in bodily fluids, His parents decide to get a divorce as this is their last straw. \n\nUnfortunately I\u2019m not done. Neither of the parents want him so he goes to live with his Grandpa. \n\nHis Grandpa died 3 weeks later and he became homeless for 7 months.\n\nI also gained the nickname garlic poop vomino effect chick. (vomit+domino=vomino if you didn\u2019t get it) \n\nI never went back to that school and I will never live it down.\n\n(Also apologies for any misspellings or poor grammar i\u2019ve been awake for 38 hours)",
