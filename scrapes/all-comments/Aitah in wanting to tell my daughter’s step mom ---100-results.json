      "selftext": "I live a few houses down from a house my ex owns. We have a 10 year old daughter together. He only stays at that home during the day whenever he has my daughter due to her school. Otherwise he lives with his wife 45 min away. \n\n9 months ago I had noticed, whenever I would get home from work, that there was a different vehicle at his home. Whatever he does is none of my business as long as it does not affect my daughter. Every Monday and Friday that vehicle would be there. Me knowing her father very well, I knew he was cheating on his wife, my daughter\u2019s step mother. My thought process was, my daughter doesn\u2019t know, therefore I\u2019m not getting involved. \n\n3 months later, my daughter sits me down and tells me that she knows that her father is in a relationship with another woman. (My daughter maybe 10 years old, but she is extremely smart). She begins to tell me that she has gone to lunch with this other woman, she texts back and forth with this other woman (bc she is a hair stylist and makeup artist), and the last time she got a haircut, this other woman was the one that cut her hair. She also tells me that whenever her step mother is not around, her dad calls the other woman from his work phone and calls her \u201cLove\u201d and has my daughter talk to the other woman on the phone. I was shocked! I didn\u2019t know how to respond to my daughter, as she is still young, and just told her that I would talk to her dad.\n\nOn our next child exchange, i spoke with her dad and I told him that he needed to stop bringing this other woman around my daughter and have them stop communicating with each other. I advised him that I did not want my daughter growing up thinking it is ok for anyone to cheat while they are in a relationship! I also told him that he is threatening and playing with her mental stability and behavior like that around my daughter I will not tolerate at all! He agreed with my concerns. \n\nHer father is a compulsive liar. He promised my daughter that he would no longer \u201cbe friends\u201d with the other woman but that was a lie. When my daughter walks home from the bus stop, she can see the other woman\u2019s car at her father\u2019s house. \n\nSo much more has happened since then but I will make it short. When my daughter is with me, I don\u2019t bring up her dad. The only time he gets brought up is when she brings him up. I will allow her to express her feelings to me and I am all ears to hear her concerns. \n\nAnyways, a week ago my daughter comes out and tells me that she no longer want to stay with her dad every other week anymore. I asked her why? She tells me that bc she is tired of her dad lying to her. She also told me that she wants to talk to her dad and give him an ultimatum: either divorce his wife and stay with the other woman or leave the other woman and stay with his wife. She also feels obligated to tell her step mom what her dad has been up to. All she wants is for her dad to stop having 2 relationships and be a good father to her but all he keeps doing is lying to her. I was very speechless. She deserves to express herself, but I feel as her mother, before my daughter does something so drastic, that I should intervene and tell his wife myself to protect my daughter from any potential retaliation that could potentially happen. \n\nI have already tried talking to her father over 5 times about how his actions are affecting my daughter and if he doesn\u2019t stop with his deceitfulness and lies, he would risk losing his daughter per her choice. He has not listened to me at all, even with all the warnings I have given him bc of my daughter expressing her own personal concerns to me. \n\nWould I be the AH if I tell his wife that he has been cheating on her this year? \n\nI need to do something bc I am now looking for a therapist for my daughter bc this is now affecting her emotionally.
