      "selftext": "I (29M) and my wife (26F) were expecting family to come visit today. My half brother and sisters dad and his significant other flew from across the country to come visit family and today was supposed to be the day they came to see us. I\u2019ve known him my whole life and he\u2019s always been like a father to me. We have been anticipating this for months, as he has yet to meet my 4mo son and haven\u2019t seen my 2yr old daughter since she was a baby. \nYesterday he texts me that my sister and her S.O, brother and his 3 kids would be joining. This is where I think I might be the asshole. \nI got upset that I was not made aware that they all planned to come over without me and my wife knowing. If I was made aware ahead of time it would\u2019ve been okay but I didn\u2019t buy enough food, my daughter is filling a little under the weather and doesn\u2019t like to be around many people when she\u2019s sick, and I have a job to go to at noon that should take me about 2 hours, having me home around 2:30/3. (I\u2019m a plumber so Sunday calls aren\u2019t new for me). I wasn\u2019t made aware when anyone was supposed to be coming over and I felt left out of plans from hosting a get together at my own house.\nI group texted everyone pretty much saying the above and that I don\u2019t feel comfortable having anyone over anymore. They all seemed understanding for the most part but AITAH?",

The food is a secondary issue for OP. OP is upset about the fact that they had the conversation without including him, as OP explained.

I don't get emotional over Reddit posts, my friend. Just like you, I comment my opinion on what people should or shouldn't do. I'm neither happy, angry or sad about the things happening in other people's lives. Don't project emotional feelings onto people via an online forum. You don't know me and I don't know you, so ascribing emotion to people you don't know makes no sense. \n\n>  \nIf you are having a BBQ and bought food for 4 people, and one of those people call you last minute to say they are bringing 3 more people, you might be a little upset too.\n\n\n\nNo! His family is not visiting him for his food! His family has literally NEVER met one of his children and hasn't seen the other since that child was little. They are coming to see HIM and HIS KIDS - not because they can get food! He isn't even the first stop they are making! He could easily say he doesn't have food to accommodate everyone and that issue is a non-issue. They want to see his children, see him and spend time reacquainting themselves. They aren't after OP's barbecue and, as OP has said himself, he knows they haven't seen his kids. Reconnecting with family is far more important than eating at OP's house when they clearly are eating at other people's homes! This is not about food at all.",
