      "selftext": "For the first six months of this year I took my nephews and nieces  (17/15/12/10) to school we were rarely late. Schedules have change and no her husband takes them to school, the kids are rarely ready to leave 10minutes after the time we would leave. \nIt\u2019s was 30 minutes after they were supposed to leave when I walked in today, watched my (12f) wandering around and loitering in the pantry, reminded her school started 5 minutes before hand and to get on with it. She started moving and I left it at that, 5minutes later and she\u2019s still in the pantry with nothing out, I tell her grab the first to things and that would do because they should have left. She grabs out some snacks 5 minutes later I walk into the kitchen and find her scooping precooked ravioli one at a time into a container to heat before transferring them into the thermos. At this point the other kids are at the car \u201cWhat the hell are you doing \u2018niece\u2019 just take it cold you are 45 minutes late and everyone is waiting in the car\u201d\n \u201cbut I can\u2019t take it cold\u201d \n\u201cThen take an extra muesli bar, hot food was 50 minutes ago\u201d \n*screams no at me and her 18f sister* \nWe reply firmly and loudly that she should have gotten up earlier and that cold won\u2019t kill her. \nHer mum comes in telling us that we are being awful and not supportive, that she would quit if her boss talked to her like that over heating food. I pointed out that after 5 months of being tardy daily she\u2019d be fired anyway. \nEveryone must always be yelling at her daughter when she\u2019s not there to protect her. \nWe were then told that being unified in something like get to school and take a cold lunch is actually us ganging up on her. \nAITAH \n\nTLDR neice was 45 minutes late to school wanted to heat pasta I said no her mum said I\u2019m not showing compassion.
