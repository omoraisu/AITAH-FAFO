      "selftext": "TL:DR \nMy brother and SIL are bad at gift giving. It bothers me, I tried to make this Christmas a kids only gifts. I'm the bad guy.\n\nI(40m) get it I'm not the nicest guy in the world, I doubt I ever will be but I do try. \n\nBackstory: my child hood was rough and involved things that could get people locked up even today. I won't go into what as it could trigger people, this is important to know. I was usually left with gifts that meant little or nothing to me and definitely not what I asked for. My brother on the other hand wanted for nothing. As an example: one year he got a full stereo deck, probably 700-800 dollars worth. I was given a telescope, probably 50 to 60 dollars, and had no interest in space at all. We were both in our late teens at the time. \n\nAlso my SIL is not very loved by my family, she usually will not even be around us when the opportunity arises. Mouths off and insults people regularly. \n\nFast forward to this year. I turn 40 only one who even bothers to care is my wife. Fine by me, but I instead blow family off so I can spend time with her and our daughter. They get mad and say I'm causing issues because everyone wants to see us. My father plans a huge surprise party for his girlfriend, doesn't even wish me a happy birthday, brother plans big football watch party, both times I  just blow them off, no real excuses. \n\nI learn the lesson that people see you as the enemy when you advocate for yourself.\n\nI did get a gift card to a movie theater from my brother, which I don't go to the movies. I've been less than 5 times since I've been an adult. I just don't go. The card was handed to me with the line \"we tried our best.\" This is a standard practice with him and my SIL. I usually get a mug(i don't drink coffee or tea) or a gift for my daughter. The irrelevant gifts piss me off. \n\nWhy? Because they can't even spend the energy/time to send a text and ask anyone what I may want. It makes me feel like I don't even have enough worth to get to know me at all. Either I'm a piece of trash or they hate me, is how I see it. \n\nHave I said that Outlook? Not to them, there'd be questions and I'd rather not have to explain the BS I dealt with as a kid. Not to mention my brother thinks the world of the one that did the bad stuff. It's just easier to shoulder it myself. \n\nSo why is all this important? I suggested we go \"no gifts between adults.\" Just get the kids stuff. I pitched it as cheaper and easier, less stress less fuss. I was confronted by my SIL openly at their eldest's tenth birthday party, and rather publicly, I'll add. \n\nI was told that my SIL loves to figure out what to get people and spends a lot of time on it. I responded with \"I've had to institute a mug in mug out policy in my house because of the number of mugs coming in.\" Yes I actually said it. \n\nAll of it comes down to now they are wanting to do a secret Santa and I'm the bad guy ruining Christmas for my SIL. \n\nI dont care about how expensive a gift is. 5 dollars or 500 doesn't mean anything to me, but taking the time to make it good is important. I've got a marshmallow roaster that probably cost someone 5 dollars. It looks like a fishing pole and even turns with the reel. The thing has a dedicated space on my mantle. \n\nSo am I the bad guy here? Really I want to know.",
