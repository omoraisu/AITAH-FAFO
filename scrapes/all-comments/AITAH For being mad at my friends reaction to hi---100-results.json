      "selftext": "So yesterday I (20m) was over at a friend's (19m, let's call him Jack) place with some other guys watching a football game. Jack's mom passed away about a year ago and he inherited her adopted, abused, autistic pitbull. \n\nJack has told me that the pitbull has bitten four other people in the past and doesn't like people in his face. Understood. So the game is going on, people are petting the dog and getting in his face. The dog isn't freaking out despite this, so I decide to give him a gentle rub on the back and let him lick my face. \n\nBad idea, and the dog tore off a decent chunk of my lip. Ok, **my bad.** I went to the emergency room, got stitches, whatever. \n\nIt isn't until this morning when shit goes wrong. I'm still on my dad's insurance so he found out today about the incident. **My dad threatens to call animal control and file a police report if Jack does not agree to pay the hospital bill.** I call Jack in a panic and tell him what my dad plans to do, and Jack responds by telling me that **if animal control gets called, Jack will tell all of our friends that I *wanted* the dog to die, and he (and his sister) will make sure I never speak to my friends again.** \n\nSo I'm panicking calling both Jack and my dad trying to get them both to calm down. I try to get Jack to give me his dad's number so our parents can go over the insurance information. Jack tells me that apparently his dad is overseas/on a cruise (?) and doesn't have a phone. So I give Jack my dad's number, and Jack lies and tells my dad that the dog has never bitten anyone in the past. (Four other people). My dad and Jack cuss each other out until I manage to get my dad to drop the police report/animal control. \n\n\nTo be clear, I'm at fault regarding the dog, I'm pissed at my friend however, for: \n\n1. Lying and saying the dog has never bit anyone else. \n\n2. Lying and saying his dad is on vacation, and somehow decided not to bring his phone. \n\n3. Most of all, saying that he was alienate me from all our mutual friends and make me look like I wanted the dog to be put down. \n\n\n\n",
