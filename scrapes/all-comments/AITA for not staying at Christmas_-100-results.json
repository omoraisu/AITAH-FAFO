      "selftext": "Every year, we have a family get together for Christmas at a relatives house where we all stay the night in guest bedrooms and on lilos. This year, my girlfriend and I (27) are travelling the furthest (by quite a way) to be there and we are the only ones working the next day (everyone else is retired, not working atm or have a the minimum of a week off over the holidays) and we have to be up extremely early to start. We have been offered to stay on a lilo downstairs (meaning we would have to stay up until everyone else had finished and gone to bed). OR, we can stay in a garden office with no loo (and would have to wait untill everyone else was awake as the family have dogs that will bark and wake the household if we were to come back in to use the loo).\n\nMy girlfriend and I have decided that this isn't suitable for us and we will be driving home (over 100 mile drive after also making the effort to drive there on the same day).\n\nThe others who will be staying in guest bedrooms (each with ensuites and king size beds) do not have work the next day and will all want to stay up until the early hours of the morning together. Added to that, several of them live within a half hour drive, but are not willing to drive home to their own beds, or to sleep downstairs on a lilo/ the garden office.\n\nMy family have responded by insinuating I'm being a child and having a tantrum over the situation, but I don't see my response as unreasonable at all and I'm not trying to make anyone feel bad or asking them to change their plans around me.
