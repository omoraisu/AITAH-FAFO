      "selftext": "I (37M) am a single dad to \"A\" (14M). For three years, I dated my ex (31F) who has a son, \"T\" (10M). The boys and I are huge basketball fans. \"A\" is a big Phoenix Suns fan (we used to live in Phoenix) and \"T\" is a Denver Nuggets fan (he was born in Colorado). \n\nWhen the NBA schedule comes out, I usually try to arrange for us to go to some games. This year, the Suns and Nuggets are playing on Christmas Day. \"A\"'s birthday is in November and \"T\"'s birthday is mid-December, so I bought tickets as a joint birthday gift for the boys. That was back in September. We did not tell the boys about the tickets, but they would find out on \"A\"'s birthday. \n\nIn October, \"T\"'s bio-dad came back into the picture and talking about how he wanted to be a family. For context, early on in us dating, \"T\"'s bio dad came back into the picture for a little while. My ex broke up with me and went back to him. That lasted about three months. When she came back, I said I want to make it work, but if something like that happens again, I am ending the relationship permanently. Rather than shutting him down, my ex was entertaining his overtures. I told her she needs to make a decision, she decided she needs to give it a chance. So, they moved out and moved in with him. This time it lasted three weeks before he gave up again. My ex and \"T\" were forced to move in with her very religious Muslim family. \n\nWhen \"A\"'s birthday came around, I gave him the tickets and said he could invite whoever he wants with the extra tickets. He decided to invite his two best friends who are twin brothers. I talked to their mother and she agreed. The twin's mother and my ex work together as receptionists at a hotel. \n\nMy ex reached out to me this weekend. My ex is working on Christmas and asked if I would have \"T\" over with us because her family does not do Christmas. I said we have plans and left it at that. I guess the twin's mother and my ex were talking and my ex asked what she was doing with her boys for Christmas since she was working. She told my ex about the game.\n\nMy ex called me angry. She said how could I use \"T\"'s gift for other kids? Can I just buy another ticket and bring \"T?\" I might have considered that if \"A\" agreed and prices were not astronological now, but they are. She called me all types of AH, that I am punishing \"T\" for her actions, etc. I think I am 100% in the right, but would love to see if there is a counter argument. \n\nAITA? ",
