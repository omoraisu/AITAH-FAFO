      "selftext": "I have never posted here before, but I have been really anxious about an interaction I had yesterday. \nFor context, I used to shop at Sephora, but I stopped because small children would be running around the store wreaking havoc. Since then, I have transferred over to Ulta for the most part. \nWhen I say \u201cSephora Kid,\u201d I am referring to the colloquial definition of a \u201cSephora Kid\u201d and do not mean that we were in Sephora.\n\nYesterday I (21) went to an Ulta to pick up some conditioner. I then got distracted and kept on trying different lip products. They only had the lip tester tools at one station in the back (which I kept going to and from). Eventually I came back to the back and saw two kids with some pink boba drinks. We were next to the Drunk Elephant section. Suddenly, I noticed a box of the Polypeptide cream (the teal one) in the trash can. I get along with all the employees at this Ulta who have met me, so I went over to let them know that I was concerned that I suddenly saw the box in the trash can (especially considering the high price of the cream and that it was the last one left as well as simple moral principles). They thanked me a million times.\nTurns out the kids had opened it to make a \u201cskincare smoothie\u201d and essentially wrecked the top. In addition to this, they misplaced the lid of the product and tried to replace it with a Tula cap. I helped the staff out with the cap situation, but then we saw the kids go past us again, so I made sure to point at them and be like \u201cyeah!! that is them!!\u201d because up until this point, they were just going off my description. Based off of what I witnessed, it seems as if the mother only took responsibility after I pointed them out in particular. \nShe had the kids apologize, but they really did not want to. Ever since this happened though, I have been worried that maybe I took it too far by vocalizing and pointing to them? I am not the best with social cues or norms or whatnot, and my pointing and vocalizing that it was those two was essentially a reflex that I didn\u2019t even think twice about until after it happened. \nPlease let me know what you think! AITAH? What would you have done in this situation?",
