      "selftext": "For context: \nMy brother is the oldest and is entitled. He was in the military and now works in a hospital. He was never really around since I was 8 and he was never much of a family guy until he got his girlfriend pregnant last year around Christmas.\n\nMy brother is notorious for not getting the holidays off usually because he forgets to request it off. Last year me and my mom had it set up to have the party of Christmas Day, my brother takes it into his own hands and says well we are coming Christmas Eve ( which my mom doesn\u2019t say anything) I already knew his plot was to change the plans. He wanted to open all his gifts and everyone open there\u2019s because he wouldn\u2019t be there the next day which we had bought a lot of food to host this party of 6. My brother had an issue with that and said we must open his gifts that night and he open his. Which I think was irresponsible on his end all because he forgot to request it off we had to have a separate Christmas for him. This was our first Christmas without my great grandma and we have never done it this way. My grandma didn\u2019t want to participate and got very upset as she was already in bed. It\u2019s like my brother can\u2019t stand when he isn\u2019t in control. The next day of actual Christmas party his girlfriend and my other brother were late  and it wasn\u2019t much of a party since we did almost everything the night before and it was pretty boring and had a bunch of left overs\u2026.and now comes to this year. This year has been very hard for me my mom and my boyfriend who rent this new apartment. We have struggled a lot financially this year. I lost my job last year due to a car accident and living in chronic pain has made it hard for me to find a job. My brother knows all this. We also just moved in here cuz we had to move unexpectedly. We had to come up with 5k. My brother simply disregards this and gets upset we don\u2019t spend more time with his 4 month old. He constant guilt trips my mom that works a 9-5 government job that she doesn\u2019t watch her enough even though she is tired and has other plans. He literally never came around before he ad a baby now expects a lot.  We told him we aren\u2019t doing gifts this year because we simply can\u2019t afford it and instead of just agreeing to have dinner he says well I\u2019m bringing gifts, which is fine I just thought it would be nice to have Christmas not all about gifts. \n\nNow comes to This morning he texts my mom that he has news and proceeds to say that his baby mama/ girlfriend\u2019s mother, sister and 4 kids are coming for Christmas. I got extremely upset that he thinks it\u2019s okay to invite people over to a house that\u2019s not his and to a party he isn\u2019t hosting or even paying for. My mom didn\u2019t say hey let me check in with your sister since she\u2019s helping me host the party, nope she just let it happen. ( I\u2019m pretty much the host as my mom doesn\u2019t cook and rarely cleans) and I made it clear to my mom that I felt disrespected last year as I had a party planned and I did alot of cooking and work  and it got ruined since my brother changed all the plans the night before and Christmas activities were done before the party. My brother has a habit of doing this and I see it as very entitled and steps all over our mom. I get it since he has a baby now he wants the holidays a certain way but he should have it at his apartment if he wants it that way which we suggested and he said no. He knows we are struggling financially and very stressed due to moving. I don\u2019t think I am wrong for being upset that he couldn\u2019t even ask first about inviting 6+ people to mine my boyfriend and my mom\u2019s house that we share equally bills wise and it wasn\u2019t easy for us to move in here. \n\n ",
