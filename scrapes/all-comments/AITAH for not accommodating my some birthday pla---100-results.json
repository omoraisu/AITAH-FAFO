We got into the topic of my birthday the other day and he said he didn\u2019t want me going out with my sister, cause she will let guys do whatever\n\u201cno she wouldn\u2019t she is a married middle age woman plus these plans are not a set deal\u201d \nOr that there\u2019s gonna be other drunk guys there. I told him how I felt and that me and him had our own separate plans for my birthday and if my sister wanted to take me out I wasn\u2019t going to decline and I feel it\u2019s not fair I have to wait. \n\nNow thinking about it idk if I sound rude or in a rush to drink which I am not but I believe I should be able to go with my sister who I trust and he trust me as well in his words.
