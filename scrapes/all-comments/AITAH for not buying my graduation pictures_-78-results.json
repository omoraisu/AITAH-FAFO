      "selftext": "I (17f) don\u2019t want to buy my graduation pictures. I won\u2019t give my parents the code to buy them either. I don\u2019t want them in the house or anywhere near me. Why? Well high school was hell for me. I got expelled from my school in junior year due to having higher needs, all of this could\u2019ve been avoided if my parents believed in mental health and took me to therapy before. I got diagnosed with severe social anxiety after (the expulsion) and was put into special ed. Which they didn\u2019t agree, they also don\u2019t believe in medicine or i am anything other than shy. I had to work by butt off to graduate on time (I basically started junior year in February). When I think about high school it\u2019s about mental hospital stays after \u201cdeleting\u201d attempts, meltdowns and scolding from my parents because they believe I was being dramatic. Next year is about moving on and I will not have any regrets I am sure about this. So AITAH? ",
