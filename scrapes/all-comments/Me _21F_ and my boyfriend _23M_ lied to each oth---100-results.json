      "selftext": "Long story short about our background, a mutual introduced him and I about a year ago and we only made it official about two months ago. During that whole talking stage, we first established that we didn't want a relationship, but acknowledged a few months into the relationship that we were basically dating but still had some issues we needed to work out, which is why we hadn't made things official. However, earlier in March of this year, he ended up lying about romantically talking to two other girls and going on a date with one of them (who he told me not to worry about because he \"didn't find her pretty\") after we established exclusivity, where he then said he didn't think we should be exclusive unless we were dating. After that, things pretty much went back to normal between us but he wasn't treating me well (dismissive of my feelings, not communicating, etc) and by June, I attempted to end things with him due to a argument we had in which I voiced my opinion over something and he attempted to add some humor into the conversation to lighten the mood. Because he had a history of being dismissive of my feelings and with the way he had been treating me, I said I didn't want to pursue things and was under the impression that he wouldn't fight for it, but he did. I ended up asking for a break of about a week to decide if I wanted to continue things, and ended up wanting to in the end. About a month before this, I had also met a new guy from another mutual who I began talking to and hanging out with, and who I eventually slept with a few times. The first guy, let's call him James, ended up finding out and confronted me about it, to which I lied at first but ended up telling the truth as he had looked through my phone. He was hurt and the trust was broken, but we ended up deciding to date and work through everything that had happened. However, since we've been dating, he has not been loyal to my standards (liking girl's thirst traps, getting a girl's Instagram through a friend and telling the friend to not let her know he is taken, etc) and I don't know what to do anymore. I was upset with him earlier today and rejected his sexual advances, saying I didn't want to because he didn't know how to be loyal, and ever since then, he's been cold. I had always believed although I was wrong for lying, sleeping with the other guy wasn't as fucked up as him lying about the other girls SOLELY because we weren't exclusive, but this is the only issue we can't get past and I don't know how to work past it either. What do I do?",
