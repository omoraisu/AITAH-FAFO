      "selftext": "Okay so for context, I [19F] went on a few dates at the end of this summer with [M23]. We had a great time, he was mature, got plans for the future, had some interests in common and I thought even if it didn\u2019t take a romantic turn I\u2019d like to have him as my friend. So fast forward, after our third date he messages me that he liked spending time with me but he\u2019s not in a place atm where he\u2019s ready for a relationship. Mostly because he had been in a long term relationship and the breakup was still kinda fresh. I thought it was great that he was communicating and said as it was, I\u2019m not doing this Situationship bullshit. After this we went separate ways. A month later I got, what felt like, a booty call where he didn\u2019t say he wanted to meet up but was talking about how he was spending the weekend in his moms apartment all by himseeelf (his parents live close to me). And when I asked what he wanted I got blocked. 1,5 months after thaaat he reaches out again and wanna talk about stuff. We do and I feel like we still want different things but anyways. During this whole time I\u2019ve had this girl stalking my instagram, I don\u2019t have a big following and I always like to look through who\u2019s stalking my stories. When I go through her instagram I see old photos of the guy I had seen a few times. Thought that it could be his ex, decides that it wasn\u2019t bcs why would she have pictures with him? So maybe a friend or a relative, besides why would his ex be stalking me? I barely knew this guy. So today I saw that she\u2019s in my stories yet again, ask him who it is and he gets all defensive and asks me \u201cwhy\u201d and then says that it\u2019s his \u201cex/best friend/ a person he really cares about\u201d. Okay so I immediately got pissed. Why hasn\u2019t this guy mentioned his close relationship with his ex, why has he been talking about me to her (she wouldn\u2019t know of me otherwise) and why is this bitch getting defensive? She\u2019s the one stalking me? So this is where I might be TAH, I told him to tell her that she can follow me instead so she doesn\u2019t have to waste her time on stalking me. My friend thought that was kinda harsh since the girl hasn\u2019t done anything wrong. But like, am I justified in being this angry? I barely even know why. How would you have reacted?\n\nFast lil edit:\nOkay I guess I\u2019m shit at wording stuff because people are missing the point I was trying to make. I\u2019m not mad at the fact that a stranger is looking at my Instagram. I\u2019m mad about a date informing an ex girlfriend (who also was the reason he didn\u2019t wanna keep seeing me) about me. On top of that with enough info for her to be able to look me up, while I didn\u2019t even know they were still in contact and even less they were \u201cbest friends\u201d. I feel like that\u2019s something you tell someone? Especially when you reach out again and wanna \u201cmake things work\u201d???",
