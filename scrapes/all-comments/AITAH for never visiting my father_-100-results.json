      "selftext": "The following is a long ranting post so I apologize in advance for the length and it being all over the place. I'm typing on my phone so it's too difficult to edit my long stream of consciousness rant.\n\n\n\nMy dad (77m) and I (38f) rarely see each other and this was never an issue until I had kids (4 & 11months).\n\nMy dad is not a bad guy, but he's selfish and doesn't often think about how his actions and words affect others. I lived with him when I was a teenager and our relationship was really problematic with him yelling at me every day, from morning until night (literally starting the day waking me up by yelling at me to turn off my alarm). Yet he had post-it notes around the house that said \"joy\" as a reminder to experience joy in life. Yet somehow not towards me...\n\nMy dad never bonded with his parents and then never bonded with his 3 kids. We're all pretty fine with it; we don't know any other way. Our mom makes up for it since she's 100% maternal, so we are healthy when it comes to relationships and am incredibly bonded to my kids.\n\nI have lived in a different city from my dad since I was 18 and I would go back home throughout the year but as time passed I would sometimes just go back for Christmas, so maybe once a year I would see him. And this is our norm. I'm not feeling the need or want to see more of my dad. I thought that when I had kids that things would change, but they didn't and later I accepted that.\n\nBut right now I am fuming. My dad has a habit of offering things - big things - and then taking them away. For example: when our first kid was about 7 months old, he offered to loan us a down payment to buy a house. We got a broker, an agent, looked at listings, and just before our first viewing, a stock of his dropped and he took back the offer. \n\nMore recently, my step mom (his wife) called me and told me they would be setting up education accounts for our kids. I was so thankful! We had been planning on starting those accounts in the new year when my maternity leave was done, but this is so generous. I called him to thank him and he said they were just thinking about it. Okay....? (He also offered to pay for my sister's university, never did. Offered my.mom back pay for child support - nope.)\n\nAnd then a couple weeks ago they said they would be calling me the next day to talk about a time to visit us. We're an hour flight away (they get free standby flights) so that sounded great to us. We last saw them in the summer and they mentioned a few times they were planning to come visit us. We don't travel, my husband works weekends, so we're always around, and I told them this, so anytime is probably good, just need a big of warning in case we have local plans. It never happened until now, the last month of the year. They didnt call when they said they would, but a day or two later we texted and I said during the week would probably be best. My step-mom said they could come the 10th to 13th and I said great, and put it in my calendar. Then I spoke to my dad who said they may not be able to make it then because they were planning on flying standby to their winter home and the later they fly out, the busier it would be Okay...I'm not the one who picked the dates for them to visit, they did. I told him I hoped he could make it because by the time they got back in the spring, the baby would be so much older.\n\nThen I speak to my dad again and he says they actually aren't leaving for the winter but they aren't going to come visit because it's such a \"schlep\". Ouch. But they will be around for the holidays so I could visit them at their place!\n\nNow, this is where I'm wondering if I'm the asshole. My sister in law has a family with 2 kids. I've been with my husband for 13 years and we spend every Christmas at my SIL's place. Now that we have kids too, it's even better because the cousins are so close and it has created a great dynamic. We go on vacation together with the 2 families and everything. Now, my husband's family is different than mine (with exception to my mom who I'm very close with). Me, my husband, and his sister are in a group chat and we talk nearly every day. My husband talks to his dad almost every day as well. His dad will even call me for tech support if my husband is working, so I speak to him fairly often as well. (My dad calls less than once a month, often going several months without us speaking.) Because of this constant communication, plans get made. After we see each other in person we are always asking when we'll see each other next and eventually plans get finalized and we make the effort to see each other again. Our place is small, but my SIL has a proper house so there's room for us to visit, so even though we have younger kids, we take the 6 hour drive (8 with stops) out to see them about twice a year. My dad lives an hour and a half from them (less time with no traffic, but there's never no traffic) but he lives in the opposite direction from us. So it would add an extra 1.5 hours to our already very long drive with 2 young kids. Plus we never stay long, 3 or 4 nights, so I'm not exactly eager to put the kids back in the car for 3 hours between 2 really long car rides. When we visited my SIL this summer, as a way to see by dad and siblings, we had a beach day with my family who then all came back to SIL's house and this was when they all met the baby for the first time. (My dad and mother in law were almost 2 hours late - something to do with the car.) To add to this, they were anti-vax during covid and we had a new baby so that created some distance and tension. I did fly out on my own with my first kid for a long weekend for my dads birthday. I came back completely exhausted because their house was a death trap for a toddler so I had to be on top of her the entire time. They even suggested a walk down by the water one night which would have been lovely except there were no railings along the water! With a 2 year old! I had to hold her in my arms the entire time.\n\nBack to the present. My sister is joining us as my SIL's on Christmas Eve so when my dad said he would be in town for the holidays, I invited them to SIL's house the same day. The conversation went like this:\n\nDad: We don't like to drive in the dark\nMe: OK, you can come for lunch and leave early\nDad: Maybe we could go for lunch at a restaurant instead \nMe: That's not the easiest thing with 2 young kids, but maybe we can find something close to SIL's place\nDad: Yeah, we'll see, I'll have to talk to MIL about it\nMe: What would YOU like to do?\nDad: *suddenly enthusiastic* well, you could come to our place the day you leave SIL's and spend the night then drive back home from here the next day!\nMe: Well, that's adding 1.5 hours to an already 8 hour drive, and extending our trip and husband needs to work when we get back so... no. That's not going to work for us.\n\nTurns out this might all be for nothing because when I asked my sister what plans she thought we should make, she told me they changed their mind and were in fact leaving for the holidays! I texted them and it's true, they changed their mind again and now the plan is to leave on the 15th (note it is after the plans they cancelled to come visit us because they might not want to leave so late).\n\nAITA? Should I be making plans to bring my kids to them since they're old even though they literally put no effort into coming to see us and hurting my feelings by offering generous things then taking them away?",
