      "selftext": "My now divorced MIL moved in with us and without asking started covering the tree with old ornaments from my spouse childhood. (Not a happy childhood or household = some of the ornaments are not good memories) \nI asked my kids to finish decorating with our family ornaments that they have made over the years first. Then they can go thru grandmas an hang the one they think are cool and are ok with my spouse. \nThat created a whole shit storms with MIL locking herself in her room tears and all. (Expected behavior)\n\nMy big hang up is she didn\u2019t ask if we wanted any of them first. Then before we could say anything the whole tree was fully of 20 years of potentially unhappy memories for my spouse. Any thoughts? Am I a jerk for being concerned and saying something?",
