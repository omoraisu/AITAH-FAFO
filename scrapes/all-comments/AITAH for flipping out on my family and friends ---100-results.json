      "selftext": "I (28F) have been married for a few years. My husband and I have always wanted to have kids. My family and friends have been asking when we are going to have kids quite frequently over the past few months. I told them we are unsure if we want kids, and they make remarks that we would be making a huge mistake. I have been very nice about the question and their comments for a while but I hit a breaking point this week. We have been holding off because daycare costs are high and this world is honestly just very expensive. I am the first person in my family that will ever have to pay for daycare for my children. My mom and her siblings all had their kids watched by my grandparents. My aunts watch my cousins kids. All of our friends somehow have parents who are millionaires (not exaggerating) that are going to retire from their jobs to watch their kids. My mom has also made remarks about my husband getting a second job to have kids. This angers me so much because she had the luxury of her parents watching me and working a low paying job her entire life that made her \u201chappy\u201d. I feel like the ass hole for flipping out, but no one in our life seems to understand the financial stress this causes and how it\u2019s not just easy for anyone to have a child. I feel like this is something my husband and I need to plan out in advance to give the child the best life we can.",
