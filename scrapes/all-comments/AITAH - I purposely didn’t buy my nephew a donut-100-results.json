      "selftext": "My sister and her son (6) moved in with my wife and our two daughters (10, 5) after an abrupt and messy divorce. He has two older half siblings, but they\u2019re both teenagers and never really wanted anything to do with him, so he\u2019s basically been treated like an only child. \nBecause of this fact, he behaves like a complete brat.\n\nHe doesn\u2019t share with my kids, even though they share with him. \n\nHe\u2019s incredibly rude to my wife and me. \n\nHe treats my kids like garbage. \n\nHe basically stares at an iPad or plays video games all day with my sisters new boyfriend and acts like the most obnoxious twitch streamer you could possibly imagine. \n\nHe\u2019s a complete tattletale and tries to get my kids in trouble for things that they can just sort out on their own. Whilst being an absolute crybaby when my kids bring up his poor behaviors. \n\nHe totally lost it when my daughter got presents on her birthday, because he thought he should be getting things as well. To the point that my sister just went out and bought him a bunch of new toys. \n\nMy sister\u2019s boyfriend will take him out for milkshakes and he\u2019ll walk back into the house to rub it in my kids faces. \n\nObviously I could go on for days. And obviously it\u2019s my sister and her ex husband who have created this monster by shrugging off these behaviors. \n\nBut while we were out yesterday, I stopped and got my kids donuts because they behaved incredibly well while I had to run errands. And whenever we do such a thing, I make sure to grab something for my nephew. I decided not to this time. Knowing exactly what was going to happen when we got back home. He, of course, lost it bawling his eyes out. I looked at him and my sister and just kinda shrugged my shoulders and left the room to let her deal with it. \n\nI\u2019m just done watching this kid be rewarded for his shitty behavior. AITAH?",
