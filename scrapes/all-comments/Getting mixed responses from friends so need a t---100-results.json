      "selftext": "Ever since I was a tween I\u2019ve HATED Christmas. Everything about Christmas from the music to the gift giving annoyed me and I spent most Christmas on my iPod or phone. \n\nI tried to make myself sick to get out of Christmas multiple times growing up as well so the hate is strong.\n\nI\u2019ve never had a real reason as to why I dislike Christmas, I just hate the entire month and try and not leave the house during December to stay away from Christmas related stuff.\n\nI\u2019m 19 and living on my own for the first time meaning I can decide myself if I attend Christmas this year or not and I\u2019m leaning towards not going and spending the day at home by myself.\n\nThe annual family Christmas group chat is back online and my auntie is running it this year, she has asked us all who is coming and I\u2019m tempted to say no.\n\nWIBTA if I did? \n\nI know that it would piss off my entire family and probably make them hate me but attending would be the most stressful thing and I wouldn\u2019t have any fun. \n\nSome friends think I should not go and have a mini Christmas party with myself while some think I should just go and suffer for the sake of my parents and family.\n\nI can answer any other questions you have if I\u2019ve forgotten things ",
