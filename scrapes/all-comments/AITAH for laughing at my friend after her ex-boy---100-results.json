      "selftext": "So this happened a few days ago and I really need an unbiased perspective. About two weeks ago, I found out that my (20M) friend (22F) was talking to her toxic ex after I happened to glance at her phone screen while she was texting him and recognized his name. I, of course, immediately confronted her about it and she reluctantly admitted that they had been in contact for a couple days at that point. I know it isn't any of my business to begin with, but she had been on and off with this guy for almost a year before finally breaking up with him months ago after he made a pass at one of her other friends. He was a douchebag from the very beginning, but she was stuck in the honeymoon phase and mostly blind to his antics. What she did see, she easily explained away or justified. Every time they had a disagreement or he cheated (again), I was the one she came too; I listened to her cry and complain and I consoled her until he texted her a half-baked apology and she ran right back to him. Rinse and repeat. It was so frustrating and draining seeing someone I care so much about consistently put themselves in a situation where they would inevitably be hurt, and I was so glad to finally be done with that cycle when she broke things off for good. Anyways, I didn't fight her much on the decision. I basically just sighed and shook my head. She's a grown woman, so there was nothing I could do to stop her. \n\nA couple days back, she texted me at around 10PM to tell me that he wanted to see her, and that she was thinking about going to his place (they had been talking, but had not yet met up since reconnecting). Apparently, he offered to pay for an uber to come and get her. He lives about half an hour away. She doesn't have a car and he didn't feel like driving down to come get her. She said she was calling because she wanted my advice. I obviously told her it was a bad idea. She said they were just going to have a conversation, maybe chill and watch a movie \"like old times.\" I told her there was no way he was paying for an uber to get her thirty minutes away and not expecting sex, so she better prepare herself for that reality. She said he didn't \"give her that vibe.\" I could tell from how hard she was defending her decision to go that she had already made up her mind. She has a habit of calling me and others for advice and then not taking it. I told her she should do whatever she wanted and that was that. Later on that night I received another call from her. I was already sleeping, and calling this late at night is extremely out of character for her, so I figured it was important and answered. Well when I answered she was bawling her eyes out. Full on sobbing. It was so bad that I thought something unrelated had happened, like maybe she got bad news or hurt herself somehow. But she ended up telling me what happened through sobs and the story goes as follows:\n\nShe got an uber to his house (he did pay for it) and because he lives in an apartment where you need to be buzzed in past a certain time, she had to text him when she arrived so that he could let her in. You probably already figured as much, but they did end up having sex. Afterwards, he got up to use the bathroom or whatever and she, for reasons I still do not understand, decided to pick up his phone that he had left behind. What she saw wasn't messages from some other chick or anything like that, no, actually it was her own text message to him that made her cry. Let me explain. I guess when she texted him to let him know that she was pulling up, he went to let her in without actually opening her message or responding to it, so it was still there on the lock screen when she picked up his phone. She saw her own \"I'm here\" message but realized she was saved in his phone as \"Ole reliable.\" When she told me that I caught the SpongeBob reference and even though I didn't burst out laughing or anything, I chuckled a little. Well, she started screaming at me and saying that all men are alike and that she knew I was enjoying her misery because I was sadistic just like her ex. Then she hung up. I was honestly already tired of the drama and wasn't interested in being roped back into their toxic dynamic. I figured she was upset now but would forgive him soon enough. I just went back to sleep and didn't bother calling or texting her again that night. But when I woke up, I had some mutual friends tell me that it was fucked up for me to laugh at her because it was kind of like I was kicking her when she was down. I wasn't laughing at her situation, I just found the reference mildly funny. Admittedly, I wasn't taking the situation as seriously as I probably should have, but I think that's because I'm desensitized to it all now. I did apologize and explained that I wasn't laughing at her pain, but she hasn't responded. AITAH?",
