      "selftext": "I (34m) saw my mom earlier today, and she told me she was hosting Thanksgiving dinner next week. She asked me to go, and I asked, who is going to be there? She gave me a look, a look that clearly said \"You know who will be there.\" So I just said no, I won't be going.\n\nI knew she was referring to either my dad or my brother, both of whom I am not in contact with. Very long story short, my dad has been verbally abusive for years, and emotionally manipulative. We had a very bad relationship for awhile, and about 2 years ago I finally pulled the trigger on going full no-contact. Very shortly after that, my brother, whom I was pretty close to, told me he didn't believe me about our dad and believed I was the primary problem, and if I just stopped being petty or whatever, it would be fine. This was very shocking, I knew he and my sister both have a good relationship with our dad but I didn't think he would just throw me under the bus.\n\nDespite being divorced, my mom and dad have a very civil relationship and often see each other for things like holiday dinners (he isn't out but we suspect my dad is actually gay). My mom is heartbroken that I don't communicate or see them, but I explained to her why I don't and likely never will again. She wants us to be able to make amends. I regularly skip Christmas gatherings, my nephew's birthdays, any other family gatherings, because I know they'll be there. For many reasons, I just can't see them. It isn't good for my mental health, I have absolutely no intention of ever trying to reconnect with them, if anything made me upset I would default to snide remarks that would just make everything uncomfortable for everyone and not at all help the situation. There's no point be around them.\n\nThe first Easter after I stopped talking to my dad, my mom invited me over for an Easter dinner. This wasn't even two months after the NC. I showed up, and my mom looked nervous and apologetic, and admitted she \"forgot\" and invited my dad to the dinner. She tried to pull the \"I mean since you're already here!\" card, but I just left. Now she knows not to try to Parent-Trap me into reconnecting, but she still clearly wants us to repair our relationship. It's just not something I'm capable of or interested in. I hate missing so many family gatherings, because I still love my mom, sister, and nephews, but as long as my dad and brother are regulars at the events, I can't be. I know how they are, I know how I am, and it's a bad mix that won't produce a positive outcome. It's gotten to the point they literally just don't invite me because they know I'll say no. Which is understandable because they're totally right. But my mom decided to invite me to Thanksgiving anyway, and I could tell saying no hurt her. She didn't say anything but it was written in her facial expression.\n\nIt breaks my heart too but I have very firm boundaries on this for a reason. I just hate that those boundaries cause negativity for the family I still care about. AITA for turning down my mom's invitation to Thanksgiving dinner?",
