      "selftext": "Hello, a woman with whom I\u2019ve had a relationship in the past has contacted me again. We were very much in love with each other, but the relationship became toxic and ended. She would like us to get back together, but there\u2019s a major obstacle for me: her drug use (which was already an issue when we were together because I was against it). She says it\u2019s something occasional (she tells me she\u2019s only used drugs twice in 9 months, even though she had taken Ritalin without medical prescription for several months, which is an amphetamine derivative, for a self-diagnosed ADHD), and she believes that my disagreement with it shows that I don\u2019t trust her to manage it, claiming it isn\u2019t a problem for her in terms of danger (immediate risks related to her use) or addiction. She sees my limit on this issue as a personal boundary of mine that shouldn\u2019t affect her. I know I\u2019m very rigid about this, but I can\u2019t see myself building something with someone who uses drugs, even occasionally. I would be too afraid that something could happen to her, and I sincerely believe it\u2019s not a healthy practice, which also reflects a deeper emotional struggle that she doesn\u2019t want to face, in addition to all the horrors that drug trafficking causes on a global scale (murders, prostitution, etc.).\n\nI would like your opinion\u2026 AITAH ?",
