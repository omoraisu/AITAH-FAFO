      "selftext": "Just writing of the top of my head since I'm emotionally in turmoil for the last week or so. English is not my native language so excuse any errors. I just need to clear my head.\n\nShort background, my girlfriend and I broke up 6 months ago. We ended things after a long period of not being happy together due to mostly personal stuff on both our ends. We still love and loved each other, but at the time we were too toxic together. We have worked on ourselves in the last months. \nWe recently decided to work on us and get back together by going to therapy, both individually and as a couple motivated by the fact that we rather want to actively work on our relationship and see if we really can have a life together, rather than running from our problems and possibly regret it for the rest of our life. We genuinely both want it to work. \n\nRight before she ended it, she slept with man X and she has slept with man X up until a month ago. Man X is married and have a children and a wife. I don't really blame her for it as it was a very turbulent time and most of what happend between them happened when we were single. It does hurt a lot, as the thought of her being with another man provokes negative feelings in me, but the prospect of us outshines that negative and I am planning to forgive it. I am a proud man however and find it difficult to accept, but I believe I will.\nShe acknowledges that she met him before we ended things and does not deny anything. She is also willing to do everything to regain my trust.\n\nSo, to the real AITAH question. \n\nI spoke with man X and gave him a chance to come clean to me, for my own process of healing. I informed him that if he lied to me, I would go to his wife with whatever consequences there may be if I do so. He accepted the terms and choose the easy way out with lies and downplaying. \nI am now planning to send proof of his infidelity to his wife and honestly, hopefully hurt him in the process. I think she deserves to know. Objectively, I believe he is the biggest A*#$@ considering he has a wife and a child. \nAITAH?\n\nI have to add, I am not perfect. I am vindictive and a maybe part of me does this to hurt my girlfriend, but I truly believe I need to \"get back at him\" for sleeping with my GF while we were together to get over this and focus on the imporant thing, us. It takes two to tango, I know, but at least she is owning up to it and wants to make amends and THAT I appreciate.\n\n",
