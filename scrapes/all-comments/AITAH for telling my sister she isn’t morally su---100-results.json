      "selftext": "I (17F) and my sister (14F) are in disagreement. This past week a business man was murdered in our country, he lead a health insurance. He was not well liked by anyone from anywhere and they have not caught his killer and I hope that they do not. Our father had insurance denials during his own cancer treatment a few years back, I would think she would remember the stress it brought onto our family. I\u2019ve seen many videos on TikTok and read tweets on twitter; this was not a good man. I said I do not grieve his loss. I keep returning with comments and funny videos I\u2019ve seen and she just snapped this morning before church and was like saying she doesn\u2019t want to hear any more arguments about this man deserved to die. Murder is wrong. I feel like a blanket statement ignores all the damage he caused. I also feel like she can\u2019t take a joke. OF course you should not murder even bad guys but I don\u2019t see this case as a huge loss and she\u2019s out here acting like she\u2019s morally better because \u201cmurder is wrong\u201d. I know murder is wrong and I wouldn\u2019t condone it repeatedly happening but she has to understand why the world is upset. Instead of educating herself she locks herself in her room. Our parents don\u2019t want to take sides but said \u201cenough is enough\u201d not everyone feels the same way but I think most everyone does feel the same way because I haven\u2019t seen any TikTok\u2019s or twitter accounts really mourning anyone or anything. Her not taking a joke has been issue between us for a very long time now and I don\u2019t think we will ever become close if she doesn\u2019t learn to lighten up. ",

Given what has happened in your family i can&#39;t say i blame you for feeling glad he is dead.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>The problem with this is it becomes a slippery slope: you get people thinking that it is ok to kill someone that isn&#39;t like. you get vigilanty justice and innocent people can get hurt. We had a spate of it where I was except it was the wrong people that were targeted (same name, they recently moved into the address of someone that wasn&#39;t liked etc).\u00a0</p>\n</div>",
