      "selftext": "So Im currently working an internship where the workload is insane, I was basically left alone most of the day and had A LOT of tasks to get done by the end of my shift. After I clocked out I thought I had gotten all of my tasks done right till the very end of my shift but today (sunday) i realized i forgot to schedule something that was supposed to go out today and i started freaking out about it. I freaked out so much I ended up texting my manager about it and apologizing profusely. I am terrified that I am going to get in trouble for making that mistake and also texting her on a sunday night.  \nShould I have just waited until the work week starts for me ? (which is until tuesday) Or was it okay to text her as soon as I figured this out?",
