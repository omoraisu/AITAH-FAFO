      "selftext": "So i'm 17 and live with my parents (obviously) and i take care of our dog who we got almost exactly a month ago from a rescue. she's about 2 and a half. she was not house trained to begin with and whenever i let her in the back yard she just sits or plays and very very rarely goes to the bathroom. when she does i make sure to give her lots of praise and sometimes a treat when we go back inside. i have school, my job, and hobbies that take up a lot of my time but i try my best to give her 2-3 good walks a day.\n\nAnyways, today i got home from my 9-5 shift at a dog daycare where we were understaffed (1 other employee besides me) and we had some not very well behaved dogs. I was tired and didn't take her for a walk when i got home but i let her out and tried to play with her and walk around the backyard to get her to go pee. She didn't. i try to let her out as often as i can remember, but it's hard because she gives very little signs about having to go. it's about 9:30pm right now and i'm getting ready to take her for her walk when i see she's peed on my bedroom floor (not a problem, i'm cleaning it up as i type). my dad comes down and notices. i go upstairs to get paper towels when i overhear my mom saying i am taking advantage of the dog and that what im doing is unacceptable. i don't really get what i did that was so bad so im asking you guys to let me know if i am actually responsible for this and am in fact taking advantage of my dog. if i am, i want to try to change and be a better dog parent. i personally don't think anyone is really at fault here since i think it was just her having an accident as we're still learning about her, but it feels like my mom is blaming me.
