      "selftext": "So I 27F have always had a close relationship with my niece 8F,due to that one day while her mom had asked me if I could take care of her that day and I ofc agreed,we started talking about how school was going fir her and she told me that one of the boys in her class who we'll call Josh was  bullying her..So from that day on I gave her some advice on how to deal with it mentally since the bullying was in words..Fast forward 3 weeks from that she told her mom that the bullying was getting physical and she had scars coming home every other day,the principal's warning wasn't enough and her mom asked me if I could teach her how to fight (I did boxing for 3 years) and I taught her a few things. So soon after that my SIL (her mom) got called to the principals office but she couldn't attend since she was away for the week so I went,upon arriving I found out she broke that kids nose after her tried slapping her..She got detention for 2 days and I lowkey feel guilty..her mom said not to and sided with me and so did my brother but my mother and father said that it wasn't good of me and now that boy has a broken nose..So AITA?",
