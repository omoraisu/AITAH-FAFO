      "selftext": "Birthdays are supposed to be special. It\u2019s a day where you see how much people love and know you. It\u2019s also a great time to figure out who will be your next arch nemesis. In my opinion I give great gifts! I listen throughout the months of things my peers like and dislike. I also keep an eye out for their favorite/new/hobbies just so I know what gift would be perfect and tailored for them. I always have a hard time with birthday since it feels like no one really understands me when it comes to gifts or plans. Everyone either forgets or has no urgency to even wish me a good birthday. My friends were late with gifting me my birthday presents and the other day I finally received them. Months later. Throughout the past months a particular hydration item has gained traction and I\u2019ve developed a pure blood boiling hate for them. I have started to see them everywhere. Every person I have ran into or surrounded myself with began to have this cup in their right hands. Decorated with a backpack or even now a new collab with a makeup and face brand. I always mentioned how much I couldn\u2019t stand this particular brand cups to any person I seen and always said I like a competitor brand that had a mixed color bottle. Anyways, they finally meet up with me to do a gift unwrapping. Lo and behold my arch nemesis cup and another pricey gift in a color (I do not like and have never worn a day in my life) were received for my birthday gifts. At first I was very happy when I received my gifts since as stated before no one usually cares. Even seeing the cup I was a little confused as to what all that time of clearly stating I did not want this specific cup. On top of the waiting two months for these gifts.
