      "selftext": "Hello everyone, I\u2019m just wondering if I am in the wrong here\n\nEssentially I went out to a bar with my long time friend, she had gotten pretty wasted as we got split up but I trusted her since she was with her group of friends too\n\nAn hour later I see her stumbling out with a guy I don\u2019t know so I follow and ask her if she is ok, obviously at this point she is black out drunk and mumbling incoherently so I ask the dude to let her go so I could contact her family to come get her or I drop her off. The guy and his friends start to gang up on me telling me to back off and trying to convince her to go with him. \n\nAt this point I knew I couldn\u2019t trust anyone in her friend group so I told them to leave her alone and that I would call her family to come get her. The dude that wanted to take her home kept trying to drag her away telling me that he only has good intentions. I tell him I don\u2019t know him at all so I don\u2019t trust him so to back off before he gets hurt. He doesn\u2019t listen and gets agitated so I pull out my knife and threaten them to leave now. \n\nI was able to get them to leave her and get in contact with her family and get her home safely. I myself am a catholic man so I firmly believe that spilling blood is a no go so me threatening someone with a knife, albeit to protect someone, is eating away at. \n\nAITA? \n\nTLDR; childhood friend got wasted, someone tried to take her home, i pulled out a knife on them to get them to back off.",
