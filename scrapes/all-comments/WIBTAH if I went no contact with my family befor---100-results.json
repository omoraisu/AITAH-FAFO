      "selftext": "Two years ago, an explosion family Christmas happened that seriously changed my perception of my family. (Find that one on my profile if you want background.) At the time, I tried to establish boundaries, primarily that I didn\u2019t want to be around my sister alone or hear about her from my parents. However those were quickly disrespected and thrown out the window. To the extent that at the following family Christmas, they sent her to get me from the airport and decided we should share a bed during our stay. \n\nI survived last Christmas despite being extremely stressed the entire time by drinking my way through the week. Which made a not great family impression, but I survived. (For reference I\u2019m generally a 2-3 drinks a week kind of person, and that week I would hit 7-8 a day.) \n\nAbout 6 months into this year, we had family visiting for nearly 1 month straight. It was during this time that I started breaking out in hives whenever I was around my parents and sister. They\u2019d cover my entire back, legs and stomach. \n\nAfter family left, I\u2019d have a similar reaction when they\u2019d reach out. They\u2019d call, I\u2019d break out all down my back from a 30 minute conversation, they\u2019d send a paragraph of a text, and before I even opened it, just seeing the sender my arm would start breaking out. At one point I thought maybe I had gotten passed it, cause I made it through a hour long video call without anything on my body, till I looked at a mirror and realized my face was swollen and my eyes lids had hives patches on them. \n\nI was supposed to go to family Christmas again this year, but I told them that I had been experiencing some health issues and that my doctors didn\u2019t think it would be wise for me to travel for Christmas. (Which\u2026isn\u2019t untrue, pcp and therapist both think this is an extreme response to stress and I need to avoid the stress they bring.) \n\nThe current plan is to send them a video of me clearly explaining my boundaries, what will happen if they break them, and why I\u2019m having to set these boundaries. I\u2019m doing a video over a text or call so that they can have time to absorb and process before needing to respond, while also showing it is actually me saying these things, so they don\u2019t blame it on my husband or misinterpret my tone through a text.\n\nHere is my question; do I tell them my boundaries before or after their family Christmas? There will be 9 people in the Airbnb for a week, 6 of which I don\u2019t have an issue with. But it seems like it might be harder for my mother to manipulate the other 6 against me if she doesn\u2019t knows this in advance. At the same time, I don\u2019t want to have this weight over me during my holiday celebrations with my husband. \n\nSo\u2026would I be the asshole if I went no contact before the holiday? Anyone with experience going no contact have advice?\n\nTLDR: my parents and sister are so stressful they literally give me hives to interact with, so I\u2019m going no contact. But would I be the asshole if I sent that message before the holidays and ruined family Christmas just so it isn\u2019t hanging over my head?  ",

It's clear you've given this a lot of thought, and your plan to set boundaries through a video message is thoughtful and considerate.
