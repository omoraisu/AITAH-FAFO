      "selftext": "Hi, I\u2019m in a bit of a situation here and I\u2019m not sure how to manage this. \n\n31m & 31f \n\nBack story a bit, we were highschool sweethearts like absolutely insanely into each other but parents really didn\u2019t approve of our relationship and eventually she fell off the face of the planet for me. We both sorta moved on but now know we both always thought of each other. We found each other about 8 years later on social media and immediately got back together, for the most part things are super great, I really love her and can 100% see a future with her. \n\nShe unfortunately had a very rough 8 years of substance abuse, SA, overall just sorta bad stuff happen to her that caused a ton of trauma which has put a lot of halts or issues in the relationship and recently she was diagnosed with BPD and is on some medication and seeing both a psychiatrist and therapist regularly however the progress is definitely slow which I get; everyone has their own pace. \n\nFreshman year of high school my parents decided to pull me out of public and throw me into home school, which I have my own opinions of but recently I found out they did not submit my transcripts to my state and as such I lack a highschool diploma. I\u2019m 31. While my career choices are also poorly made I am a 3rd party k9 handler but I\u2019ve always wanted to be in law enforcement and be the change law enforcement needs because I believe if you want change in something you have to be that change and feel I could do exactly that. Unfortunately law enforcement has a age limit of when you can get hired on as a new officer which I\u2019m kissing the limit of that age so I decided instead of trying to do school between a irregular high demanding job handling k9 I would go navy reserve which would not only help me get my GED in the process but also give me the qualifications needed to be a cop and help me propel myself into a long term reliable career with benefits for her and I both, better home buying power and eventually live the life I\u2019ve always dream of which is just simply comfortable because I\u2019ve always stayed just above drowning with expenses. She\u2019s very comfortable herself and has a high paying comfortable hybrid work from home job that meets all her needs which is all I want for myself. \n\nWhile the other issues in the relationship are overall tolerable and will get better with time and mental health help on her end she is extremely against the military regardless of the reasons and has told me \u201csome people just don\u2019t get everything they want\u201d. I need yall to understand I\u2019ve never been on vacation, often have to ask my dad for help to stay above water, have no clue how I\u2019m going to get a new car when my current finally meets its end and ultimately just want to experience a little bit in life outside of never leaving my hometown outside of job training when you get a new dog or need to certify. She tells me I\u2019m her only purpose in life and the 10 weeks of navy boot camp is too much for her to handle. She\u2019ll kill herself if I go, I don\u2019t care about her, none of this affects me and so on. Tbh this is all stressful including boot. I\u2019m worried about getting hurt, failing, not being good at it, I am older which is scary and now I have this on my shoulders. Am I being selfish? Should I just continue running the gamut on a generally unreliable employment just due to high turnover rate and it all being contract based which can be lost at any time? Am I really just this shitty person wanting to help myself have a more reliable career and be able to comfortably provide for myself? I really feel bad putting so much on my dad financially as an adult and while he does so happily my dad deserves to use his own damn money as he pleases not planning to help his 31yo son out on the gas bill or from being short on rent. \n\nI\u2019m really at a loss here, she won\u2019t live with me because my place is too small and I can\u2019t live with her because she roommates with her sister to help make things easier. Homes are way too expensive and well out of our reach for purchase. If we tried to rent together we have too many dogs as she has 2 and I have 3. I really don\u2019t want the carry the weight and have someone\u2019s whole mental health and purpose be hinged 100% on my shoulders. I\u2019m at a loss. I love her but I also need to make sure my life can be sustained. What do I do? I swear in soon and don\u2019t want anything to happen to her and I\u2019m really scared. People with BPD are often successful in their attempts and that would really put trauma on me. \n\nWhat do I do? ",
