      "selftext": "\n\n\nA group of friends went to an art open studios today.\nOne friend got there early and found a studio that was giving away free art.\nShe grabbed a framed piece thinking that another of our friends might want it, but when that friend saw the color and knew I liked the color, she offered it to me. \nI thankfully and gladly accepted, and was also able to pick up some other pieces that I liked.\nWhen I got home, I realized that another piece I had chosen was the same size as this odd shaped custom frame, so I swapped the piece I chose (and liked better) for the piece that my friends had offered me, and excitedly sent a pic to both of them of the newly framed artwork, telling them THANKS!!\nInstantly I get a response back from the friend who found it first, asking me where the original artwork was.\nI sent a picture showing that it had not been harmed, and was then told that 'had she known I only wanted it for the frame, the first friend would have never offered it to me'.\nI certainly didn't \"only want it for the frame\", I just liked the other piece more.\nNow they're both upset w/me because they feel like they did me a kindness by offering me the picture, and if I wasn't going to keep the picture intact, then I also shouldn't keep the frame. \nI can see that, but I also feel like when you give someone something, it's w/o strings, though I'm certainly not doubling down on that. \nI am perfectly fine putting the original artwork back in the frame and returning it to my friend, I just don't see how I so quickly became TA when I had no idea that I \"should have known\" that the picture was only mine if I kept it as it is.\nFWIW, I've always had trouble navigating \"girl subtext\", and I guess I just missed the boat on this one. \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\n\n",
