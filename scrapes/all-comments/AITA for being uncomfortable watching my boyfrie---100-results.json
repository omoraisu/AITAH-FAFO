      "selftext": "To preface, my boyfriend is 20M and his sister is 19F. They grew up very close and have shared a bed when they were younger. He tells me sometimes they still sleep in the same bed. I thought this was strange, but it\u2019s really none of my business to judge their relationship. The other day we went in her room and his sister was laying in her bed. I sat on the edge of the bed and my boyfriend climbed on the bed behind me and started spooning his sister. I\u2019m not sure how close their bodies were to each other. I went on my phone to avoid looking at them and when I turned around they had changed positions. He was lying on his back and had his arm around her while her head and hand rested on his chest. I felt excluded and like I was intruding on them. I talked to him about it and told him it made me uncomfortable for them to cuddle because it made me feel very disconnected with them. He told me to leave his house. We talked about it the next day and he told me he told his sister what I said. I feel like I can\u2019t be around him or his family for the near future. Should I cut my losses? Is it weird for them to cuddle in front of me?",
