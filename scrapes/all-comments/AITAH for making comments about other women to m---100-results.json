      "selftext": "Let me be clear, we aren\u2019t together anymore. My (33M) soon to be ex wife (28F) are going through divorce now. I\u2019ll just refer to her as S.\n\nShe has give me a lot of reasons why our marriage didn\u2019t work, but I\u2019m just asking if I\u2019m the AH about this specific thing. \n\nWhen we first started dating, I was pretty open about my past sexual history and would test the waters about what I could say in front of her. Most of my ex gfs were pretty open to me saying things about other women, so I was surprised when S expressed to me like a year into our relationship that she didn\u2019t like it. \n\nShe says these examples ruined her self esteem: \n\nShe asked me once what my favorite porn was, so I showed her a video of this girl (my favorite p*** star) getting herself off. She asked me why it was my favorite, I told her pretty bluntly that the girl has a perfect physique and I find her facial expressions and ability to squirt extremely sexy. S said that this was the moment she felt not okay with me looking at p*** anymore, which felt extremely unfair because she\u2019s the one who asked me. She told me that when she asked me, she didn\u2019t expect I was going to show her and thought I would just tell her like a genre or maybe something I would like to try. I guess I misunderstood and have apologized for this. She said she feels bad because she looks nothing like this performer, I told her she doesn\u2019t need to look like her but I do also like to look at this performer because she\u2019s extremely attractive. \n\nNext example is just sharing past details. She asked me once what the best sex I ever had was, and I told her it was this one time with my ex. She got extremely upset and said that she asked what OUR best sex was, but that isn\u2019t what I heard. I apologized and told her it was only because my ex knew how to squirt and I had never been with someone who could do that. She felt super self conscious after this because she does not squirt, and I\u2019ve asked her on multiple occasions to try it and she wasn\u2019t able to. Which I\u2019m fine with, obviously. I even told her it doesn\u2019t mean anything and that I still enjoy sex perfectly fine with her.\n\nThe last straw for her was when we were watching a movie and I saw the actress and said \u201cshe has literally the best boobs.\u201d and then S wouldn\u2019t let me see her without a shirt on for weeks. And after that, I kept all of my comments about other women to myself once I realized how truly insecure S is. I have apologized and told her that it doesn\u2019t mean anything about her and that she needs to work on her self image. But when she wanted to divorce me, she said these were part of the reason. Things I said over 2 years ago and have since stopped saying. \n\nWe\u2019ve had mature conversations about attraction to others, sure. But I have been much more filtered and have explained that I\u2019m just a guy and that I like women, but that nothing compares to the mother of my child. It feels like she defines me by these comments I made and have apologized for. \n\nObviously they were tasteless and I should not have said them, but she actually let this be a determining factor of ending our marriage and that is just bizarre to me considering it was so long ago and I have since changed and have been a much better partner. She is still to this day the most attractive woman to me and she doesn\u2019t believe it.\n\nSo am AITAH for comments I made years ago that she most times ASKED for and that I have since apologized for? Did I rightfully ruin her self esteem? Or is she just an insecure woman who needs therapy? ",
