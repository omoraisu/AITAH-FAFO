      "selftext": "So I(23f) came from the foster system. When I was out, I had no financial resources and had to buy the only vehicle I could to survive. We live in a region where winter is harsh. My vehicle doesn't do well in this weather, and to make matters worse, the heater and defroster have stopped working.\n\nMy boyfriend of 4 years lives with his parents, and they were selling their van. I asked if I could purchase it, even threw in a little more above asking price. They said sure. So I've worked hard these past 2 weeks to pay in full, only to arrive the morning we scheduled for the exchange and find they sold it the night before. Pretty much just shrugged off what we discussed.\n\nI thought his parents like me, but needless to say, that's not the case. I've been upset since now I don't know what to do. My vehicle won't last another winter. They knew the situation. They didn't care.\n\nIt's not really selling the car to someone else that sucks, it's the disrespect. Since then I don't go over there. I don't want to. My boyfriend said I'm invited to Xmas but I told him I'd rather celebrate with my cats.\n\nHe's getting annoyed, I can tell. I don't want this to impact our relationship. I don't want to be petty. I just know through this event I'm not welcome.\n\nAITA?",

You can't be accused of breach of a contract that has no consideration.\u00a0\n\nFor example, if you tell a panhandler you'll give him $100, but you don't, that's not a breach of contract, because you received no consideration in return. But if you receive goods and services on a promise to pay, and then fail to pay, that's breach of contract.\n\nThe deposit would have established consideration. But not just in technical legal way. It would establish that they owed her something, if they failed to produce the car on a certain date.\u00a0\n\nI gathered that she thought they would give her the deal, based on her habitual sexual relationship with their son. But again, that's something no one I know would ever say, and especially no man I know. \"They knew my car was a piece of shit and I can't afford a new car. They owed it to me, to sell it to me cheap!\" No self respecting man would ever say that. Most women I know would not say that, either. But women on Reddit all seem to share that view.\n\nI suspect the other side of the story, the part being left out, is she has a history of guilting people into helping her out, and then demanding more, once they help her. The fact that she feels she has no alternative in terms of buying a car, now that this deal is off the table, indicates that she was not offering the pay the market price for it.
