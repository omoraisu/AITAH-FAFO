      "selftext": "I (29F) have a dog, Max, who I absolutely adore. He\u2019s been with me for five years, and I treat him like family. He\u2019s a little quirky but very sweet and friendly. I recently invited my friend (28F) to visit for the weekend, and she brought her new partner (32M) along. I haven\u2019t met him before, but she was really excited about introducing us.\n\nEverything seemed fine at first, but on the second day, her partner started making rude comments about Max. He called him ugly and annoying, and when Max tried to get attention, he made a face and said he was \u201ctoo needy.\u201d I laughed it off at first, thinking maybe he was just joking or didn\u2019t understand how much I love my dog.\n\nHowever, the comments kept coming. He even told me that I shouldn\u2019t \u201cspoil\u201d my dog and that it was \u201cembarrassing\u201d to let him sleep in my bed. I tried to ignore it, but it started to really get under my skin. I told him to stop, but he just brushed it off and laughed like I was being too sensitive. It got to the point where I didn\u2019t want to hang out with him at all, and I felt super uncomfortable.\n\nI ended up telling my friend that I was fine with her staying over, but I wasn\u2019t comfortable with her partner staying at my house anymore. She got really upset and said I was being dramatic and unreasonable. She also accused me of \u201covervaluing\u201d my dog and making her feel like she had to choose between me and him. I told her that I\u2019m not going to let someone disrespect my dog in my own home, and if that means they can\u2019t stay, then so be it.\n\nShe\u2019s been texting me non-stop saying I\u2019m being selfish, and some mutual friends have also said I should have let it slide. Now I\u2019m feeling guilty because I do care about my friend, but I can\u2019t stand the way her partner treated my dog.\n\nAITA for refusing to let him stay over?",
