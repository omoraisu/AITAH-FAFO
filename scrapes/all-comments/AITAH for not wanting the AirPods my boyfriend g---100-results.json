      "selftext": "Saw someone else on here posting a similar story months ago and I just had an almost identical situation happen to me so. \n\nSo basically, I\u2019ve been using my gen 2 AirPods for the past 4 years and they finally gave out last week. I planned on getting myself a new pair. My boyfriend was the first person to notice that the earphones were malfunctioning cuz we were on FaceTime and he couldn\u2019t hear my talk at so with my AirPods in. So I told him that I\u2019m just getting the same ones again once I get my paycheck the following week. He asked me why I don\u2019t upgrade to the AirPods Pro. I responded that I\u2019ve tried both before since my parents have both but I just 1. Didnt like the way it looked and 2. They hurt my ears, which the gen 2 doesn\u2019t. Plus the gen 2 is way cheaper so it just makes sense for me. \n\nThe following week, I get a notification that I got a mail. Lo and behold, my dear boyfriend got me a pair of gen 3 AirPod. They were refurbished so there were scratches on the actually case but that didn\u2019t bother me. But I felt a little bittersweet idk. I was very thankful that he got me a new pair of earphones but it\u2019s as if he wasn\u2019t listening to what I was saying at all and that kinda upset me. \n\nUnfortunately, I made the mistake of asking him why he got me the gen 3 if he knew I preferred the gen 2. He said he thought I needed an upgrade but that I can return them if I didn\u2019t like them so he can get his money back. I knew he was rightfully hurt because I would be too if someone didn\u2019t necessarily appreciate the gift I gave them. At that point I didn\u2019t know what to do and I felt like an asshole I just returned them cuz idk at least he\u2019s getting his money back rather than seeing me wear these knowing I questioned his gift? Idk what the logic was really lol. I did end up getting myself a pair of gen 2 anyways which were like $80 cheaper than the gen 3s so. Idk I just apologize stating that it wasn\u2019t my intention to come off as ungrateful and reassured him that I really appreciate his gift, but a part of me is feeling weird cuz he essentially never heard a single word I said. Idk am I the asshole here?",
