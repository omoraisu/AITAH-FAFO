      "selftext": "\nFor starters my (20f) fianc\u00e9 (21m) just moved 3 hours away from our families due to a job opportunity for him. The move has been super hard on me due to me being so family oriented. So to help me my fianc\u00e9 bought me a cat. We\u2019ve had her for a couple days now and she\u2019s finally started to warm up to us and is laying in bed with us at night to snuggle. This morning this original owners messaged us asking for her back. I have thought about it all morning and I decided not to. I have grown attached to her somewhat already and don\u2019t feel like it\u2019s fair to my fianc\u00e9 and I to give up a cat we have already somewhat bonded with. We messaged the people and told them now they are cussing us out saying we are horrible people because we won\u2019t give her back. They\u2019ve offered to give me a kitten from one of their other cats but I\u2019m not interested in them. I\u2019ve done nothing but thought about it but I just can\u2019t see myself giving this cat back. Am I the asshole? ",
