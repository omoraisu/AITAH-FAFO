      "selftext": "I (28M) am married to my wife (27F). We have been together for approximately 5 years, married for 2, living together for 4. Since we have been living together, she has repeatedly gotten frustrated or mad at me for not waking her up in the mornings on the weekend when she sleeps in and I got up before her. (to clarify, she does not have any commitments like work or school on the weekend)\n\nFor example, I get up around 8am to start my day. Eat breakfast and catch up on work emails. She will have alarms set for 8am, 9am, and sometimes others in between or after but will rarely get up with me. Although she set alarms, she does not always get up when they go off. She will often snooze or turn off the alarm and fall back asleep. When she snoozes or turns off the alarms, she will likely sleep in until 10:30 or even 11:00am. When she finally gets up and sees the time, she is mad that she has wasted her morning sleeping.  Because of this, she has asked me to take a moment to gently check in on her in the mornings to try and wake her after hearing her alarms snoozed. I have agreed to do this when I can, but clarified that she should not rely on me as an alarm clock as I am sometimes preoccupied with what I am doing and loose track of time. My issue is that she gets mad at me for the times I loose track of time and let her sleep in. \n\nI think it is also worth mentioning that she is not a morning person (neither am I, and cant blame her), but my gentle wakeup calls are not always welcomed with appreciation as she is normally grumpy and does not want to get up. \n\nThis morning, I lost track of time while catching up on work stuff and let her sleep in until 11:00am. When she woke, she was mad at me. This frustrated me because I did not feel it was fair to be held accountable for her sleeping in. \n\nShe argues that she often hits snooze or disables her alarm in her sleep and she cannot control sleeping in at times. However, she has work hours from 7am to 4pm and gets up on time every day for this consistently without any help from me (I can fortunately sleep in a little longer before work). Regardless of her snoozing her alarm in her sleep, I feel that if she wants to get up by a certain time in the morning, it is within her control and is her responsibility to  provider herself with the means to do so and not rely on me to do so for her. I do not have a problem with helping wake her up occasionally, however also do not feel it is fair to be put at fault for her sleeping in if I fail to do so.\n\nSo AITAH for not waking up my wife in the morning?",
