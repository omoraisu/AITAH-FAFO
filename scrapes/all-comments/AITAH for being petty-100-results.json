      "selftext": "For context, I have 4 sisters\n\nSister 1 - She ran a business along with my mom and she is an exact copy of my dad\nSister 2 - She is my dad's favourite and she can do no wrong \nSister 3 - she is my parents slave and is always at their disposal (ergo, my parents favourite)\nSister 4 - always blends in the background ergo, not a nuisance (to my parents)\nSister 5 (me) - my mum had me at an old age so it was a rough pregnancy ergo my mom blames it on me \n\nLet's get into it ... \n\nI feel like my mom doesn't love me? I know she does but the other day, she told me to make banana bread and it's been 3 days and she STILL is yet to eat it. I asked her yesterday and she said \"I'm really full\" but then she asked for this banana sweet soup my eldest sister made. I asked her about it because I was hurt, and she said \"oh it's old ppls food\" and all of a sudden, she said \"do you want me to die? You wanna force feed me?\" and I was like \ud83e\uddcd\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f, I just wanted to ask (I was on the verge of tears). I feel like my mom is never on my side. She knows everyone's favourite food and fruits but mine. I told her about how much I liked peaches but then she was like oh that's sister 3's favourite. Like I don't care? I was talking about me but why do you have to divert it to her and literally everybody else? I don't understand why she never takes my side. I'm your baby so why don't I feel like it? My mom and dad works all the time and they were always busy when I was a child, I barely saw them. I wasn't neglected or anything because I have a maid but i feel emotionally neglected. To make up for lost time as a kid, I try to put my dignity aside and still get close to my parents and try to do everything for them yet they still don't favour me. I feel so sad because I know they don't love me as much as the others but does it hurt y'all not to show it? I know I'm the most expensive (I have a lot of problems medically and stuff) but that wasn't my doing was it? I can't get myself to hate them because I love them too much \ud83d\ude2d \n\nPlease give me advice on what I should do and pls no dissing my parents or anything, I just need actual advice on what to do from this point because all I want to do is cry but that won't solve the problem.",
