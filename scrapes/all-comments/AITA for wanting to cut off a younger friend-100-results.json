      "selftext": "I used to be neighbors with these kids who are way younger than me when I was little. Even then I didn\u2019t ever really enjoy doing things with them because of how different we were and my parents at the time forced me to play with them. They moved away to a completely different state years ago, but they still try to keep in contact with me, specifically one kid who I\u2019ll just call Mike.\n\nI am now 20 years old. He is about 14 and still in middle school. We are completely different people. I don\u2019t enjoy talking or playing games with him because of the age gap and how immature he is. He is constantly texting me and spamming me invites on Xbox.\n\nWhen I play games with him I feel like I have to turn off most of my personality. I just generally feel weird playing games and talking with someone that much younger than me. I don\u2019t enjoy any time I have playing games with him. I would so much rather be talking to my other friends.\n\nI have told him before that he doesn\u2019t need to send so many invites. I\u2019ve tried to set a boundary by saying I don\u2019t have much time to play games because I\u2019m in college, and when I am playing games it\u2019s just to unwind and not play with people. He respected it for a few weeks and has now returned to spamming me daily.\n\nI want to just block him on everything and finally cut him off. But there\u2019s this part of me that feels so conflicted with that. He really does just want to play games and talk to me and I\u2019m a little upset at myself for how annoyed I feel with him. But he has also just been totally oblivious. \n\nI\u2019ve given him every reason to stop trying to talk to or invite me by either saying I can\u2019t play games or talk, or more recently, by not responding at all. But he still stays consistent. Am I an asshole?? And should I block him?",

And he's immature as a fourteen y.o. so he keeps spamming because maybe he doesn't want to cut the link with you. You know him better.  \nBut you also have your own college life to discover. You can lessen your contact to a gameplay session at your preferred time rate (once a month or two) explaining him you're busy so it's the best you can do. And if you have exams or social event planned then you can skip the session or reschedule.  \nBlocking him would be harsh imo because I don't see any harm.",
