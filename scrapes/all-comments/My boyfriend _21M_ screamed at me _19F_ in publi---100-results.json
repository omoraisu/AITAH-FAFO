      "selftext": "Hi all,\n\nBasically the title - me (19F) and my boyfriend, who we'll call Jake (21M) basically went absolutely schizo, or in non Australian terms, went crazy in Footlocker yesterday after I refused to buy him some new Airforces.\n\nSo to begin with we were at the mall originally to check out some stores to see if there were stocking any Sanrio items, which is something I'm obsessed with and he knows that nor does he really have a problem with it, until now apparently.\n\nI had worked a few shifts last week to cover the costs as well as have a few extra hundred so I could restock my makeup and so he tagged along, as he usually does but we walked past Footlocker and he saw there was a sale on some Airforces, he immediately was like \"I gotta buy those\", so he got his size and we went to pay but he turns to me and says he's not money.\n\nI was confused because usually he only buys things if he's gotten paid or definitely has money in his bank/cash on hand. So he's just staring at me as if to say \"You gonna buy them\" and I was like \"Jake, I can't I've gotta get plushies\" his faces dropped and he become irritated, his entire vibe shifted and out of no where he literally just starts going off, saying things like \"Why do you waste your money on useless shit\" and \"I'm fucking done with this stupid obsession\".\n\nI was speechless because up until now he's a sweetheart and even had encouraged my Sanrio \"obsession\", and it's not an obsession because I'm actually autistic, which he knows as well so it just adds salt to the wound.\n\nI ended up buying them because I was on the verge of having a panic attack with everyone watching, and then the second we walk out he gives me a side hug, kisses my head and tells me he loves me. I didn't know what to do or how to approach this but when we got home I asked what happened, very nicely might I add and he just started what felt like gaslighting and deflecting the situation kind of saying I was blowing it out of proportion. \n\nAnyway, his mother who I am extremely close to I sent a long message expressing my feelings over what happened and she called him later that night and tore him a new one. Now he's pissed at me, saying what I did was childish and we could've just spoken about it like adults. AITAH?",
