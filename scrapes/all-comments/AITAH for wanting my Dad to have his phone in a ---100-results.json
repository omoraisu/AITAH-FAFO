      "selftext": "So sorry for the essay, I just really need to know if AITAH. My Dad\u2019s in hospital after a crush injury, he\u2019s 60 however is healthy. He broke his pelvis and shoulder, nothing else apart from bruising. He\u2019s mentally absolutely fine. \n\nThe hospital is unfortunately nearly a 2 hour drive away but we have been visiting nearly every day, I don\u2019t have much holiday left in work (half a day) so I am now going to struggle to see him. My Dad\u2019s phone was crushed in the accident however was due a new one as his contract ended, so one of my first priorities was get him a new contract, which was the plan before this happened, just didn\u2019t get round to it yet. \n\nAnyway, we sorted his phone out 3 days ago and I was relieved, my Dad was excited to have his phone soon so he can then play his games and talk to people as he isn\u2019t getting many visitors at all due to how far away the hospital is. I was excited to be able to talk to him to get updates on how he\u2019s doing rather than having to go there every single day as he\u2019s now on the mend and feeling a lot better. I would obviously still see him every other day but just takes a little bit of pressure off. \n\nSo phone is sorted, phone is delivered to his girlfriends house the next day and I was shortly going to set up his phone (as I usually always set up his phones). However, when I messaged his girlfriend to ask if the phone had been delivered, she ignored me. \n\nThe next morning, I called the hospital for an update on Dad\u2019s condition, another reason why I want him to have his phone is so I can stop pestering the nurses.. and following that I called his girlfriend to let her know what they said (he was doing well). We chatted for abit and then she goes on to say (without me asking) \u2018oh the phone has come by the way, but I don\u2019t think he should have it until he\u2019s a little bit better\u2019, straight away I got my back up. \n\nBecause why on earth wouldn\u2019t you want him to have his phone? I\u2019m trying to think of reasons on the spot why it wouldn\u2019t be a good idea and I just can\u2019t think of anything, but then I said \u2018is it because you don\u2019t want people to pester him, asking him how he is etc\u2019 because I can understand that, and if that\u2019s the case we can just tell people to leave him alone for now (although i don\u2019t think it is that, she said it wasn\u2019t that anyway\u2026) and she said \u2018no it\u2019s not that, I just think it will confuse him and I just think we should wait until he\u2019s a little bit better first\u2019\u2026 \n\nnow pause for a moment, because she was there when we were visiting him and he\u2019s asked me to sort his phone out for him, she was there when I was on the phone to his phone contract company and knew the phone would be delivered to her and I would set it up, I was there with her after, not with my Dad, on the journey home and she knows I set up the phone for my Dad for every new phone he has and not once did she mention about it being a good idea if he didn\u2019t have his phone. \n\nIt completely took me by surprise that she thought he shouldn\u2019t have this new phone yet, it\u2019s an iphone and only one up from the one he had so it\u2019s not like that would be confusing. He is completely mentally sound so I just don\u2019t understand why she is trying to control him like this. \n\nI am furious and all she kept saying on the phone was \u2018I hope you think the same as me and you understand why, I think he should set up the phone as well\u2019.. when I said \u2018I want to be able to speak to him though whilst he\u2019s in hospital\u2019, she said \u2018maybe you can get him a cheap one for now\u2019\u2026 but why! He has a brand new contract phone right there!!!!!! I just don\u2019t understand.\n\nI went to see him today and he was asking where his new phone was, I said \u2018*girlfriends name* has got it, she\u2019s coming soon so she should have it with her\u2019\u2026 they arrived and my Dad asked straight her away, \u2018did you bring my phone?\u2019 And she said\u2026.. I forgot it. And he\u2019s like \u2018you\u2026 forgot it? Awww \u2639\ufe0f\u2019. \n\nI feel awful I haven\u2019t told my Dad the truth of what\u2019s happened. I just said she has the phone, I will set it up when I have it, which isn\u2019t a lie, however she lied straight to his face. I feel like I am a weak idiot who should stand up for him and myself\u2026\u2026. But I am just lost for words to be honest. \n\nAITAH?!?!? ",
