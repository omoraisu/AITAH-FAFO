      "selftext": "My (26 M) brother (35 M) and I were never close as children. Being 9 years apart and having different dads was hard for us. He never wanted a sibling and made it very obvious for our entire childhoods. Him and his friends would play mean pranks on me. Make me seek during hide and seek and while i was counting fully leave the house, locking me in the bathroom, and even once leaving dog poop in my shoe. I was miserable growing up and my parents did nothing. Anyway, as we grew up and he moved out we didn't see eachother or talk except for holidays. Now we get to the problem. This Thanksgiving, we were all back at my mom's house for dinner. The plan was we all stay with her for the week (it's a big house). On saturday, my brother thought it would be a good idea to climb up a ladder to try to hang some christmas lights from the roof of our mom's house. He was on the ladder when he decided to pretend to fall off the ladder as a joke. I was holding the ladder under him, but the force of him shaking it from up high made my grip slip for a second, and he fell. He hit the ground hard and he was bleeding all over and definitely had a broken arm. He asked me to call the ambulance but I didn't. Ambulances are usually upwards of a thousand dollars and I knew he would somehow put the charge on my card. I called my aunt over and we lifted him into his car. The whole ride over, he was yelling at me for not calling him an ambulance when he needed one. He was calling me names as i drove him to the hospital. As soon as I knew he was safe I went back to our mom's house, got my car, and drove 2 hours back to my house. At that point I was so tired of my family I couldn't bear it. I slept peacefully in my own bed but when I woke up I had a ton of missed calls. They were all my family berratting me for not calling the ambulance for him. Apparently his blood got on the seats of his car and it's going to be an arm and a leg to get it out. He is trying to make me pay but I won't. It is not my fault he fell. But my whole family is acting like it is. Everyday I am getting more and more threats and harassment from my family to pay off his medical bills and the money to fix his car. Should I pay it?
