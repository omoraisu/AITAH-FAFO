      "selftext": "My husband and I have been together for almost 15 years. The vast majority of that time, he\u2019s smoked pot. This wasn\u2019t a huge deal back in the day and I smoked some as well, still vape every once in a while, recreationally. But my husband has been using it all day, every day, for years. It\u2019s how he gets through his day and he\u2019s lied to me about it countless times for apparently no reason at all. When he started lying about it, I was so confused, because I would smell it on him and he would just lie to my face about it. \n\nA few months ago, he got laid off, and he\u2019s been looking for work since, but mostly because I\u2019ve monitored his job search and have made all of his resumes. Aside from a few applications here and there, I\u2019m not even sure what he\u2019s been doing with his time. We got in a huge fight a couple of weeks ago bc something I\u2019d been asking him to do for weeks never got done and it ended up costing us a lot of money. I absolutely lost it, not to mention all the stuff that needed to be fixed around the house, hadn\u2019t gotten fixed despite him having all this time off, and me being on him about the repairs every day. \n\nSomething wasn\u2019t connecting and I finally was like, look, I think it\u2019s the weed. It tricks you into thinking everything\u2019s ok and zaps your motivation. Ntm I suspect it could be the cause of his crazy mood swings. \n\nWell that lasted all of three days and he came clean about it, but seemed to think that it was ok he started back because \u201cat least he didn\u2019t lie to me about it.\u201d\n\nFF to today when, having been sick most of the weekend, I walk out to find the house a disaster, for no reason. Of all the time he has on his hands, it doesn\u2019t seem like a lot to ask to keep the house clean since I\u2019m the only one working, so I\u2019m rarely home. I reignited the conversation about pot again and he LOST IT. He even decided it would be a good idea to bring up my abusive ex who had a drug problem of his own. I had to forgive him for my own peace, but my husband has always had this weird complex about me \u201cforgiving\u201d him for myself. So tonight he asked me why I seemingly had more sympathy for someone who beat me up, than I do for him. I was like\u2026.wtf? First of all, I left that guy, and I forgave him to myself, FOR myself, YEARS before I ever even met my husband, because otherwise I wanted to die. This is all a pretty sensitive topic for me but I tend to surround myself with people who use things I tell them about myself against me, so, I probably should\u2019ve never told him in the first place, which is on me.\n\nAnyway, I\u2019d had enough. I told him if he doesn\u2019t stop smoking weed, we\u2019re over. I never thought I\u2019d be willing to throw such a long relationship out the window over marijuana but here we are. AITAH for giving him such an ultimatum? He seems to think I\u2019m not being fair to him, or empathetic to his mental state, but he\u2019s using pot as a crutch. If he was using it recreationally, I wouldn\u2019t give two fucks. But he uses it ALL DAY, every day, and I swear it fucks with his moods bc if he\u2019s not high, he can\u2019t be normal. ",
