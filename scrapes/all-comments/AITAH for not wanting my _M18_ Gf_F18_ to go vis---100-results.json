      "selftext": "Am I the arsehole for not wanting my girlfriend to meet a guy I know she is attracted to\n\nSo, my girlfriend and I have been together for a year and we get along really well, haven\u2019t fought once. I really do love her and I know she loves me as well. We started travelling separately about a month ago and everything was well, but a few days ago we called and talked about how you can sometimes get attracted to people you meet. I\u2019m aware of that, I sometimes get the same feeling, but communication is really important to me, so we talked about it for a while. It\u2019s just been two guys for her, one she found semi attractive, the other one she said was an 8/10 for her, if I wasn\u2019t in the picture. With me in it she says he\u2019s a 4/10 in comparison. She traveled with him and his friend for a bit, but then left them a while later. I think that\u2019s ok, nothing wrong with seeing him for like a week. I asked her to keep her distance from people like that, not ignoring them, but to have some emotional distance. She says she doesn\u2019t want that, because she thinks she\u2019d value the person as a friend as well. I know they had some late night talks and ever since he left they apparently message each other from time to time. I don\u2019t like that. I mean she met the guy for 5 days and now she messages him, she says she felt a real connection to him and I feel that that could lead to emotional cheating. Still I can live with that, as long as it stops one day and stays casual. The thing that makes me angry is that she wants to go visit him. She is in America anyway and he lives about an hour from where she\u2019ll stay, so she said she wanted to go meet him for a few days. I don\u2019t want that, I love her and she hasn\u2019t known that guy for that long, why try to build that relationship. She says that she just wants to keep him as a friend, but I fear that spending prolonged time with him will make it worse. I told her it would make me feel bad if she went to meet him, especially when she hasn\u2019t seen me for 4 months at that point. She says that she feels I don\u2019t trust her and that I\u2019d be stopping her from meeting her friends. Am I in the wrong? I know I get jealous quickly, so maybe I\u2019m overthinking this. She isn\u2019t really familiar with emotional cheating or anything like that, for her cheating just seems to be physical. I feel like shit the last days, my heart is racing, I feel nauseous and I just can\u2019t. Any advice would be greatly appreciated . I know she\u2019d never cheat on me romantically, but emotional cheating is way worse for me. I send her some signs of emotional cheating, like feeling the person gets you in a special way etc. and she says she feels that way with her incredibly close friends as well, but i feel that it\u2019s different, because she likes the guy and she\u2019s only known him for a short time. What am I supposed to do?\n\nTldr:  my girlfriend met a guy whilst travelling she finds very hot. She wants to go visit him. I don\u2019t want her to",
