      "selftext": "I got into a bad car accident this past week and have TBI, eye damage and a nose injury. My friend and I originally had plans to hang out this day but they were still in the air since she has been stressed at work. She messaged me the day before asking if I was still down and if not maybe this weekend, I of course did not respond that evening due to car accident I was in. I did respond a day after to give her an update but alas no response. \n\n\nI\u2019m sure she\u2019s seen the messages from me letting her know of my situation, I want to give grace and hold space for anything she\u2019s going through in her own life as I know I\u2019m not entitled to an immediate response. But it would\u2019ve been nice to have her check up on me and just ask if I\u2019m okay as I\u2019ve done for her so many times. I personally don\u2019t think AITH in this situation because aren\u2019t your friends supposed to care?! But, I would love other people\u2019s perspectives lol because I really want to cut this girl off for her coldness. ",
