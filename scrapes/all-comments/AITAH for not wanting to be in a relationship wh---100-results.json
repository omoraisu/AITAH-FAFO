      "selftext": "I (15 F) have been talking to this guy (15 M) for a couple months and I know that he likes me. A couple weeks ago, we were talking about dating and he told me that his parents wouldn't let him date all of high school. I told him that it was alright and that I still want to talk to him. These past few weeks have been really nice, but I don't know how to continue in the relationship, since I've never dated anyone and would really want him to be my first. I don't see myself having any other romantic relationships for a while after this one. I've gotten pretty attached to him, and he makes me super happy (although this situation has caused me a considerable amount of stress). I really don't want to lose him or make him feel uncomfortable, but at the same time I don't want to be a pseudo-girlfriend for the forseeable future. Because of this stress and my overthinking, I've been pretty distant from him while trying to figure things out. Last night, he asked me why I wasn't talking to him as much, and I told him that our situation was really hard for me because I want to do all the silly couple things that high schoolers do. He understood, and we decided to take a break from each other while I thought over the pros and cons of \"dating\" him. I feel pretty guilty for doing all this to him though because he didn't do anything wrong. Some of my friends were telling me that I was an asshole for telling him that I needed space because I like him and he likes me, and that taking a break is causing both of us a lot of hurt that could have been avoided.
