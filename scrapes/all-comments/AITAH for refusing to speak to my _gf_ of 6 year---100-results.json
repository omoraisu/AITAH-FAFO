      "selftext": "I don't get it, when we first started dating I helped her travel to another city across the country to meet her biological father for the first time at 33 years old.\n\nShe didn't grow up with much, foster home system, I've tried my best to take care of her. I've always made sure she had a roof over her head, paid the bills, drive her to and from work while working myself. \n\nI've tried my best to always be there and always be supportive. The past month two things have now happened that maybe I'm making a bigger deal of than I should...\n\nOne is I took a week of vacation after getting a CT scan for Lymphoma, she worked literally all 7 days in a row. One of which she was off and offered to go In....\n\nNext was this morning, there's a band Slowdive, I had tickets to see them years ago in Toronto but couldn't make it, regretted it every since as I'm a massive fan. I got the notice they were playing here but it was sold out. When she asked what I wanted for Xmas it was to go to that show with her. \n\nWell 4:00am I got q notification 2 balcony seats became available, knowing I had to grab them fast I was super excited. She told me she doesn't want to go, I've been in music my whole life and sharing this kind of thing is important to me, unfortunately my best friend passed away 2 years ago and really, she's never been to anything like this, I even said I'll buy the tickets myself, I don't even care about presents, still a hard no.\n\nSo screw, I'm going alone, bought my own ticket and told her not to bother getting me anything.\n\n Am I an asshole for feeling like s*** about this. Its not like a thrash metal concert, and she knows I bought her Jelly Roll tickets that were 6x the price for her Xmas present, its not like I'm even remotely a Jelly Roll fan, but sharing others joy is important to me.\n\n Is it really that big of a deal to come watch literally one of the most laid back relaxing bands possible in balcony seats with me or am I an asshole for taking this so personally.\n\nI feel like the past few years its just been me going to work, getting home, staring at the frigging wall waiting to get her at work and repeat. She knows I've been going through some stuff depression wise, when I saw the \u00dfhow announcement I was excited for something for the first time in a long time, she said she'd come, unfortunately it sold out before we even had a chance. I just happened to have these waitlisted tickets come in my queue this morning.\n\nThese past few years have been hard, my best friend, closer to me than my brother passed, my other oldest friend moved to another country, and the remaining bandmates of 12 years have had to go on hiatus as one is going through chemo. I've felt so isolated and depressed. To me this is about more than just some show.. maybe someone understands, maybe I'm f*d in the head. I honestly don't even know anymore.",

Grief is hard, my life has been gigging, throwing/promoting events and running an indy label fmsince i was basically a kid. I don&#39;t literally sit and stare at a wall but it&#39;s been a really hard couple of years. </p>\n\n<p>She&#39;s welcome to commute home whenever she likes and go out whenever she likes, nobody is forcing her to be picked up. </p>\n\n<p>Anyways, ill go enjoy it by myself. Just would of rather been told upfront she didn&#39;t want to go so I could have at least got someone else to come, but whatever, it is what it is.</p>\n\n<p>Stating people don&#39;t match with nothing but a few paragraphs is why I was reluctant to post here. In some cases thats obvious in controlling and abusive or extremely emotional distant relationships. I needed to vent, and well, those ones to me are either going through something (chemo), moved away or passed and I was just bummed out.</p>\n</div>",
