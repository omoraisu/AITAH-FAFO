      "selftext": "Mia and I have been best friends forever, so when her boyfriend, Jake, messaged me, I didn\u2019t think anything of it. He said he was working on a birthday project for her and asked me to send a selfie for it. I thought it was a little random, butt it seemed harmless, so I just sent him the picture.\n\nThe next day, Mia called me, absolutely losing it. \u201cWhy would you send Jake a selfie of yourself?\u201d she yelled.\n\nI was so confused and told her it was for her birthday, but she didn\u2019t care. She said it was inappropriate and started accusing me of \u201cgoing behindd her back\u201d and crossing boundaries. I tried explaining over and over, but she just kept yelling and wouldn\u2019t listen to a word i said.\n\nBy the end of the day, Id had enough. I blocked her because I couldn\u2019t handle the constant texts accusing me of things I didn\u2019t even do. Now I feel guilty, like maybe I made things worse. But at the same time, I don\u2019t think I deserved to be treated like that. So, AITA?",

Might as well be smoking it up, I already look like it every-time I stand up. What\u2019s more insane is I know a dude named Brian, and a couple named Jeremy and a Jody\u2026. I was Navy here. That was fun, hell on relationships though, people aren\u2019t like they were when my grandparents were around. My great fathers both were in WWII along with my Great Uncle. My Great Uncle was captured by the Nazis and survived 4 and half years in one of their camps. What\u2019s crazy is that when I returned from the Navy I was given the blanket that he was wrapped in when he was rescued when we won the war, turns out, it\u2019s EXACTLY the same blankets I used when I was in the service\u2026. Pretty wild. Old wool blankets, black and grey. At any rate, my great aunt and grandmothers were faithfully there and proud of their spouses, these days, you go off to war and it\u2019s time to play single and go screw all your friends. Lovely getting a letter from a friend you can actually trust telling you, that your spouse is out banging everything they can get their hands on. Smh. Going to bars, making out with everyone, humping legs etc\u2026 well you get the picture lol",

Acknowledge that if he were unfaithful with her best friend that this would certainly be devastating, but reinforce that this is not happening.\n\n4) be open and show her the conversation in full in your texts. You've already revealed it was for a surprise birthday gift, so you couldn't spoil it again, but in this scenario, you need to even if that secret wasn't out yet.\n\n5) now, be stern. \"I appreciate that this would have been devastating if true, but I am showing you that your suspicions are unfounded. We can work through this and be friends, but only if you show me the same respect I have just shown you, and not talk to me like this ever again.\"\n\n6) advise her to follow up with someone about the level of her reaction. If her boyfriend is always acting sketchy such that she is always suspicious of him, them be done with him. If there is no behaviour that would justify this, then see a therapist yo help her understand why her response was so explosive. Regardless, this behaviour is not to be between the two of you ever again.\n\n7) let things cool off for a few days or even longer.\n\nIf at any step the responses are not reasonable or seem to be non-genuine apologies etc, then keep that distance and put your own self respect and mental health first.",

If not, temporarily block again.</p>\n\n<p>2) once things are calm enough to be civil, reach out and ask if you guys can meet somewhere. Just you and her. I&#39;d keep it to public spaces, but perhaps somewhere you&#39;d normally hang out together</p>\n\n<p>3) explain to her that you can see that she is very concerned that her boyfriend is not faithful. Acknowledge that if he were unfaithful with her best friend that this would certainly be devastating, but reinforce that this is not happening.</p>\n\n<p>4) be open and show her the conversation in full in your texts. You&#39;ve already revealed it was for a surprise birthday gift, so you couldn&#39;t spoil it again, but in this scenario, you need to even if that secret wasn&#39;t out yet.</p>\n\n<p>5) now, be stern. &quot;I appreciate that this would have been devastating if true, but I am showing you that your suspicions are unfounded. We can work through this and be friends, but only if you show me the same respect I have just shown you, and not talk to me like this ever again.&quot;</p>\n\n<p>6) advise her to follow up with someone about the level of her reaction. If her boyfriend is always acting sketchy such that she is always suspicious of him, them be done with him. If there is no behaviour that would justify this, then see a therapist yo help her understand why her response was so explosive.

Sounds like he doesn\u2019t want them to be friends anymore and I personally think that the friend is freaking out because he has said something like she\u2019s always hitting on him. And he has been telling the girlfriend that her best friend isn\u2019t really her best friend and created an opportunity for him to use this against her because his girlfriend was not listening and was not agreeing with him. The only reason that kind of freak out is if he has been chipping away at their friendship For a long time and putting doubts in her head. I personally think that you shouldn\u2019t block her. Just send text messages of the screenshots of him asking for the pic for her birthday and leave it at that. Don\u2019t read her text messages and just realize that she\u2019s being extremely manipulated by her boyfriend. Hopefully she\u2019ll see through his crap soon. Apologize to you and realize what happened. if I\u2019m right, this means he is seriously abusive and he\u2019s just getting started. The goal of any abuser is to create situations and remove their significant other from all family and friends to make them feel like they are alone, and they have to solely rely on their abuser. It often starts with manipulation, emotional abuse and gaslighting. Don\u2019t block her, be there for her and realize that something is wrong. Especially if this is out of character for her and you guys have a strong friendship. Obviously you can only be there for her so much, which is why I\u2019m saying just send the screenshots of what he asked of you and leave it at that. Don\u2019t block her if she needs to reach out, she should be able to. I hope I\u2019m wrong and I hope everything works out.",
