      "selftext": "I am a writing this story asking if I am the asshole almost a year after this happened due to my father reaching out asking for forgiveness saying that I\u2019m the one in the wrong. For background I was 21 living at home, my dad and I have always had a rough relationship.\n\nAnyways this happened on December 12, 2023\n\nMy family (my mom, my brother (age 3) my dad) made plans to go pick out or real Christmas tree after I got out of work at 4pm. I asked earlier that day if my bf (Age 20) could join, my parents have never had an issue with him. We all met at home and got in my dad\u2019s truck to go get the tree. Everything went fine, we got the tree, had some laughs. I literally no idea that the night was going to take such a turn. \n\nWe stop at Pizza Hut on the way home and got food to take home. We get home and enjoy the food. We get the tree screwed in the base and my mom is bending over to get the based screwed in and my brother keeps trying to jump on her back. I yell at him to knock it off. In turn my dad yells at me for yelling at him. I brush it off and start talking to my bf about some lady at work ( I worked in retail at the time)\n\nMy bf and I go watch a movie in my room (door open) my brother comes to join us. My dad comes in and grabs my brother from in between us. \n\nAbout 15 mins later my dad comes in and says my bf has to leave, (it was like 8pm) I hadn\u2019t  seen him for a while and I was upset. When he left as I was saying goodbye I was crying. \n\nHe leaves and as I am walking back to my room. I am stopped by my mom and dad, in the dining room. They tell me that I am not taking care of myself because I hadn\u2019t showered that day, that I was selfish ( I ate the last breadstick from when we got Pizza Hut) I need to take of myself, I\u2018m spending too much money. My dad then says that I can\u2018t yell at my brother like I did, and that I shouldn\u2019t have laughed after I did. I said I didn't laugh . He said you did. I said I didn't . He then stands, and balls his fists, I say if you hit me I will call the cops. He runs at me and punches me in the face. My glasses go flying. I\u2019m laying on the floor from the punch . My mom is in between us and my dad is screaming at me. I don\u2019t remember exactly what he said but I rush to my room and grab as much as i can. ( this all happened in about 10 mins fyi)\n\nI had planned on spending the night at a friend\u2019s the next night and so I had a bag packed I grab that bag, my stuff animal and a blanket. I grab my phone,and keys. I ran while he was screaming. He screamed things like \u201cYour bf isn\u2019t allowed here ever again, we will never financially support you again, you\u2019re an ungrateful piece of shit, etc. \n\nI got in my car and called my best friend. She lives down the road not even a mile. I called and just showed up, I would have called my bf but he was driving home still. I get to her house and i call my bf\u2019s mom. He just got home and she sends him right back to me. I\u2019m sitting on my best friends couch. Holding a ice pack to my face as my best friend tells me I have to call the cops, \n\nI do. They charge him with harassment with physical contact, I get told it is best that I stay away by my mom and the cops. That weekend I went to the er and I was diagnosed with a mild concussion. I also had bleeding from behind my ear from my earring going into my head when punched me.  \n\nI live with my best friend for a few months then live with a few others eventually. I was living in my car, then with my bf family then I finally got my own place. During all of this my own family cut me off because of me calling the cops CPS could have taken my little brother away. I got told many times that i should just let go what happened. And that my actions affect others. I wasn\u2019t invited to any holidays, and I\u2019m only invited to one this year even though there are 3 of them. \n\nI more to tell but I figured I would start here. Just for reference this isn\u2019t the first time my dad has hit me. ",
