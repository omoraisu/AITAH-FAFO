      "selftext": "I am 48F and my youngest son is 18. My niece is 17. They are both in their last year of high school. She started dating one of my son\u2019s best friends 17M two months ago.\n\nThey seem happy and they get along great, but the problem is that my son feels like he has to do everything with his cousin now. My son and my niece have always been more like brother and sister than cousins, so they\u2019re close but they get on each other\u2019s nerves. My son and his friends like to do things and just bring their girlfriends or whatever, but now that means my niece has entered my son\u2019s friend circle. \n\nHe complained about it a little, but it was silly complaints. It was mostly that his friend never wants to hang out anymore, and I told him it happens when people date, I even reminded him of how he was with his last girlfriend when they started dating. He accepted it after that but I\u2019ve gotten a little more concerned. I\u2019ve just seen him not hang out with his friends as much, even when they invite him, staying home more, and just generally seeming sort of down. He's changed since he's stopped hanging out with friends.\n\nI knew this was because of my niece and her dating situation, so I asked her if she\u2019d be open to stop dating his friend to get his mental health back on track. I didn\u2019t tell her, I didn\u2019t demand, I didn\u2019t say she needed to, I simply asked her if she would stop. She cried, she was frustrated and upset and I understand, I told her she doesn\u2019t have to, maybe just encourage her boyfriend to spend less time with her and more time with my son or something like that but either way it wasn\u2019t the end of the world.\n\nThat night her dad, my brother, was really upset that I\u2019d even ask that. My husband was too, he said they\u2019ll all get over it eventually, it\u2019s teenager stuff. I agree, but I still worry. My brother told other family members and now most of my family are saying it was wrong of me to stick my nose in their business.\n\nI\u2019m just getting a lot of crap from different directions because I\u2019m being told it was wrong to try to intervene in something that will likely blow over anyway. I don\u2019t know if it will blow over, but I\u2019m familiar with how teenage relationships go. I honestly just want my son to be okay. I didn\u2019t want to hurt my niece, I just wanted to see if that was even a viable solution to the problem at hand. Now that I know my niece is serious about this, I\u2019m not pushing, but I\u2019m still being told I\u2019m an AH.",
