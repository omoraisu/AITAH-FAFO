But then non of the days after he has come and he asked very little about them, on Saturday I got mad and told him I didn't want to ask anymore because his duty was to be here with us (we have another 3 years old, but my father is here to help us out so he could have stayed at home with my other kid and my partner spend some time with us). Also I found out the last 2 days he had played a bit of FIFA too and he literally told me he was chilling.. ",
