But, think about this: They aren't entirely wrong. You WILL be judged on your appearance. By strangers in public (who cares?), and employers (this is huge.)\n\nLook, do the hair for sure. That doesn't really shock anybody anymore and is easily changed. \n\nPiercing is more difficult. A couple or three ear piercings and a nostril or even a lip isn't that big a deal. But ear gauges or 10-20 ear piercings and, really, septum jewelry, will definitely limit many career opportunities. The good thing about septum piercing is that you can just take out the jewelry when needed and nobody will be the wiser.\n\nTatts are very straightforward. There are plenty of career doors that are automatically shut to you if you have visible tatts. That may change someday, but it's for real right now. You will not be working in a law firm. You will not be working in any sort of high-level corporate job. You won't even be hired for many customer-facing positions where rich people are the customers. Think concierge in a 4-5 star hotel.\n\nSo, get the tatts if you want, but don't do sleeves, hands, fingers, or neck.",

At some point, you&#39;ll realize that family, true family, doesn&#39;t think you&#39;re dishonoring them by being happy with yourself. Family aren&#39;t the people you&#39;re related to. Family are the people who treat you like family. Try fitting into the mold and see where it takes you. It will take you to a dark dark place, where everyone tells you you&#39;re doing great while you ain&#39;t doing anything that actually makes you happy. You will feel like crap because of that divide in how you see yourself versus how they see you. Stay true to yourself.</p>\n</div>",

I am told they are more painful to remove than to get them. I die my hair blue and I am a youngish grandma but it's not to cover gray, I don't have much gray. I also have two tattoos. One with meaning and one that's not. I waited until I was 30 to get so I knew I wouldn't regret it. I don't regret blue hair or the tattoos. I still hate the lip piercings but she's the one wearing them, I'm not. I also used to have a tongue ring. I never regretted that either. Once you're 18, be YOUR normal self,  not someone else's normal self. So if that means piercings, weird hair and tattoos, go for it. That's you. That's who you be true to!",
