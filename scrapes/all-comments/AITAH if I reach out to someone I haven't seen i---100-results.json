      "selftext": "When I (43M now) was 20 I met a girl (18 at the time) while working at a sandwich shop. We eventually hit it off and dated for a total of 10ish months. She was a rodeo girl and was beautiful, smart, and motivated and had a good bit of direction on her life and I fell for her pretty hard. I had no real direction at the time and I remember her taking me to check out a technical college or something, Then she tried to get me to take classes at community college. \n\nI ended up screwing things up and she stopped talking to me. Among just being an idiot when my shitty car would pass DEQ she registered it in her name to bypass DEQ. Well It was a stupid idea and probably my idea. A ball joint failed on a pizza delivery and it got towed... in her name. I couldn't get up the money to get the car out and she got the bill. Her and her parents got pissed at me. At the time I think she was cooling off on the idea of me anyways.\n\nIt was certainly entirely my fault and I knew it, afterward when I realized she wasn't taking my calls and I was persona non grata, I decided that anything I did to try and get her to talk to me again would make things worse and I worked on letting go. I decided to get my life together if I wanted her or someone like her in my life again. From this a life's work erupts. I get my GED soon after spend most of my 20'2 in and out of community college getting my associates. I was supporting myself and on my own since 16ish that's why it sook so long to finish my associates degree.\n\nI never got to thank her for being the good influence or the reason I got my life together. for the longest time, somewhere she was always the motivation pushing me to be better and be something.  Eventually I met my wife and we we had a healthy baby boy 2 years ago. So rodeo girl is now the third best thing to happen to me. Things at home are good btw.\n\nWhy the issue has come up now.\n\nA few weeks ago I was talking to a friend about how they tore down the old pizza hut I worked at. He loves to prompt me about a story concerning the rodeo girl showing up at the pizza hut. So that brought her up from no where. Then the union contract with tuition reimbursement came into effect and I'm looking to get my EE bachelors. I've been asked why I want to go for it, I have a good stable union career. After examining my motivations she comes to mind. Finally third, a few days ago I was cleaning out my office and looked at a photo album and a picture of her 19th birthday dropped onto the floor. I'm not kidding. \n\nNormally when the topic comes up I can just take the memories of her and put them back in a box and back on the shelf it goes. This time it's bothering me. \n\nI looked her up on Facebook and she's there. Just a beautiful as I remember..  married and hopefully happy. AITAH if I reach out and say hi or thank you for being the catalyst for me getting my shit together and being a better person, I'm not trying to date the woman but of all the people who have come and gone from my life, She is the one I wish I had managed to keep in my life as a friend.",
