      "selftext": "My 15-year-old son recently sustained a metacarpal fracture. It\u2019s his dominant hand, too, so it\u2019s been a tough adjustment. He stayed home for a few days to recover, but after some time, he decided he wanted to go back to school. Before he did, I spoke to the school to make sure accommodations were in place. They assured me that he could type out any written work since handwriting would obviously be an issue.\n\n\u00a0\n\nEverything went smoothly with his teachers\u2014except for his maths teacher.\n\n\u00a0\n\nApparently, during class, she was writing formulas on the board and expected everyone to copy them down. My son explained that he couldn\u2019t write comfortably with his injured hand and needed to use the classroom computer. (Every classroom has one, so access wasn\u2019t an issue.) She refused. Her reasoning? \u201cYour fingers aren\u2019t in a cast, so there\u2019s no reason you can\u2019t use them.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nNow, it\u2019s true\u2014he doesn\u2019t have a full plaster cast. Instead, his ring and pinkie fingers are bandaged together, and he wears a velcro wrist support. But moving his hand causes pain and he needs to rest it as much as possible. He explained this to her, but she stood her ground. She claimed that letting him use a computer would be unfair to the other pupils who were writing by hand.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHer next suggestion? He should write with his left hand. But his left-handed writing is illegible, so that wouldn\u2019t help either. He tried to explain why these weren\u2019t realistic options, but she kept refusing.\n\n\u00a0\n\nHe was going to need these notes when revising for his exams. At this point, a friend offered to let my son borrow his maths book after school so he could type up his notes. It seemed like a practical solution, but the teacher wasn\u2019t having it. She got angry at my son for just sitting there, even though he literally couldn\u2019t do the task the way she demanded.\n\n\u00a0\n\nShe ended up giving him a detention for \u201cnot participating.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI was livid when I found out. I called the school and explained the situation to the headteacher. To their credit, they sided with me and agreed the detention was unfair. The headteacher spoke to the maths teacher and had the detention cancelled.\n\n\u00a0\n\nLater, I mentioned what happened to my sister, expecting her to agree that the situation was absurd. Instead, she said I was in the wrong. She thinks my son deserved the detention for \u201cnot following the teacher\u2019s instructions\u201d and that I was undermining authority by going straight to the headteacher. She even went as far as to say I\u2019m setting him up for failure by \u201cshielding him from consequences.\u201d\n\n\u00a0\n\nI don\u2019t think I did anything wrong, but now I\u2019m second-guessing myself. Was I out of line for stepping in and getting the headteacher involved? Should I have made my son serve the detention?",
