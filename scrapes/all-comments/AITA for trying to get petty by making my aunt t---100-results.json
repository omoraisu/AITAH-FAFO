      "selftext": "In the 8 of December evening I just did something wrong. I put a pack of antihistamines to my aunties drawers to kake a point.  (EDIT: this is bad english and I'm not from the states, so I'm adding more context.) \n\nim 21 F with my aunt who is 35 F. Long story short we had an argument regarding antihistamines aka the pill you take when you\u2019re itching badly. \n\nshe basically said that she needed it but sonce she ate something last last night that made it so bad. I told her i didnt have it anymore. it was months now when i last saw it. \n\n\nto explain that part, basically there was a restaurant that my aunt and her friend visiting us from australia that were going to, and I was feeling rather itchy those few months ago.  \n\nI couldn\u2019t remember much, but all I knew was that I was given antihistamines. since it was a really specified what I needed to take I just took the entire thing, but it was said that  this friend of her needed that antihistamine so I eventually tried to give it back to him. \n\nSince I didn\u2019t realize that I finally remembered why it was still with me was because he told me \"I can keep it\" or some sorts. It was a very long time ago, so I really couldn\u2019t remember the whole details. \n\nWe basically had an argument regarding that one. \n\nThis part will be very important because I remembered being upset, but just defending the fact that I do remember giving it to him, and I had a lot of pride in my opinion at least for that time. \n\nThe lead on after we finally got to church  (we were going to the church at that time) she told me again how forgetful I was and that I need to stop. \n\nIt was a fair point because I always forget. I won\u2019t lie about. Although if I were going to defend myself, and wish I could say it to her, I\u2019d say I was battling with some mental illness that I have yet to go to a doctor for. I suspect I have ADHD or CPTSD. But this is another topic. \n\nLong story short  I\u2019m still petty with her that time that I really didn\u2019t want to talk. I got a bit sassy when she asked me if I can drink water and I just told her \u201cno I\u2019m fine to not drink water.\u201d sarcastically. Needless to say that made her not wanna go sit next to me. \n\n\nI don\u2019t know if that\u2019s an asshole mover or what but feel free to grill me on this one. \n\n\nThen there\u2019s me doing the petty part. We were still basically not OK. \n\nI remember that I had to ride her car home and she took off after that. \n\n\nsince then, I accidentally found the antihistamines that she was looking for and then I remembered what really happened\n\n\n\nSince I was sincerely tired of trying to make a point yet never win at any arguement, being that I am younger than her she helped me out get to another country, she got me a job at her second job, she\u2019s the one that did a lot of things for me, the odds were just stacked. I always was said the things i needed to improve on, but the delivery to me always wasn't the best sounding. I had enough... I had to do turn things around. I did turn them around. Why was it never enough?? So if I can't do something, then I just had to make it look like I was in the right for once. \n\nI guess I had it coming. \n\nSo what did I do? I tried to put those antihistamines just to make it look like that. She was in the wrong. \n\nLater that night, she was so pissed. She finally lashed out. She said that her patient was on the roof. she said that she\u2019ll call my parents and tell me all of the wrong things that I did when I was in a different place, which is now. \n\nShe definitely remembers where she places her stuff, which is surprising because ironically, she does tell me that she misplaced an item, but it was one time after all.\n\nBut then again, she is tired to do stuff on her own.\n\nSo I don\u2019t know. \n\nBasically, I was told that we\u2019ll see if I\u2019ll survive out here without her help. \n\nAnd honestly felt numb. I feel bad. I know all the sacrifices that she did. If anything it is beyond dollars for me to repay her. Now she doesn\u2019t really wanna talk to me at all or go near me. \n\nI have regrets but I don\u2019t know what is in this situation. \n\nI wonder what will I do right now? Truly I am grateful to be here. I always tell that to myself. I do suck at reciprocation. \n",
