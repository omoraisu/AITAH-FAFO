      "selftext": "Just a heads up I used ai to help me write this if it\u2019s seems abit robotic. \n\nA couple of months ago, I sold a high-end hair straightener to a friend for \u20ac100. I originally bought it for \u20ac200 about a year ago, and it had only been used 15 times or less, so it was in great condition. She asked if she could pay in installments, and I agreed, telling her she could take her time. Over the next month, she only paid me \u20ac25 of the agreed amount, but I didn\u2019t pressure her because I trusted her to follow through eventually.\n\nRecently, she messaged me saying her mom had bought her another hair straightener, so now she wanted to return the one she bought from me and get a refund. I was really taken aback because it had been over a month since she bought it, and I felt like the sale was final. I explained to her that this wasn\u2019t a loan; it was a sale, and it didn\u2019t make sense for her to return it after using it.\n\nHer response was defensive and dismissive. She told me the straightener was in the exact same condition as when I sold it to her, implying that my concerns about the condition were unfair or unwarranted. She also brushed off my feelings by saying it shouldn\u2019t matter if she used it since I could still sell it for the same price. I tried to clarify that my comment about the condition wasn\u2019t meant to accuse her specifically of damaging it\u2014just that once something leaves my care, I can\u2019t know for sure how it\u2019s been handled, and that\u2019s a general concern I\u2019d have with anyone.\n\nI also pointed out that this issue ultimately stems from her mom buying her another straightener, which is outside of our agreement and not my responsibility to fix. I suggested alternative solutions: her mom could sell the new straightener, or she could sell mine and use the money to pay me back. I even said I\u2019d be willing to take the straightener back and refund her the \u20ac25 she already paid, even though I feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to.\n\nWhat upset me the most was how dismissive she was about my perspective. She didn\u2019t acknowledge the inconvenience this caused me and instead seemed focused on making this my problem to resolve. I was especially surprised at how quickly she mentioned the \u20ac25 I could \u201ckeep\u201d as compensation, given that I had told her there was no rush to pay me the full amount.\n\nAITA?",
