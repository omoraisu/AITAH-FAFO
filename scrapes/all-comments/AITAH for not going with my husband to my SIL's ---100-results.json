      "selftext": "I (30F) and my husband (31M) were invited to my SIL's Christmas gathering. However, there's an issue that has been weighing on my mind. My SIL is currently in a relationship with a man who has a history of being a sex offender. While my SIL claims that he's changed and that she's in love with him, I can't shake off my feelings of discomfort and concern.\n\nI expressed my reservations to my husband, who thinks I\u2019m overreacting and believes we should support SIL and give her boyfriend a chance. However, I firmly believe that it\u2019s unsafe for me to be around someone with that kind of history, especially in a festive family setting where alcohol may be involved, and children could potentially be present.\n\nUltimately, I decided that I wouldn't be attending the gathering, and I told my husband he could go if he wanted. He was upset with my decision and feels like I'm causing a rift in the family. He says I'm being judgmental and that it\u2019s not fair to isolate SIL because of her boyfriend's past.\n\nI feel guilty for potentially putting strain on my husband\u2019s relationship with his family, but I also feel it's important to trust my instincts about safety. \n\nUpdate: I never had details of what he did to get on there so I went along with someones suggestion and looked him up on the registry. I had thought of it before but it felt kind of icky with the thought of knowing. The information I will share is he had a couple of sex crimes, both over a decade old and involving sexual assault and groping of adult women. I'm not sure if my husband is aware of this but I feel it's important for me to bring it up to him.",
