      "selftext": "Ok so first time posting and I am autistic so please be clear with your verdict. \nI have a friend who is generally man centered so we spend time together in sort of an ebb flow based on when she is interested in a man or not. \nShe gets pretty obsessed and single minded about a guy and he is all she will talk  or think about. We have know. Each other for like five years and when she peaks with this stuff I usually just step back and mind my own business.\nShe pared up with a guy at her job as friends with benefits. She asked my opinion and I was thumbs up if she was just using him for sex because he is kind of a walking bag of red flags. I should have known better though and she is all in on him as of about two weeks into their just sex deal. \nHe is a genuine mess - 3 kids under 4 with 3 different baby mama\u2019s living with one of them - no car and was working a labor gig at 20 an hour- he has since been put on probation for drug use and no shows and recently fired. He got a car in October and I was jazzed since she drove him to and from work plus shopping and dinner each day.\nI was rude about him early on and told her he was too stupid to fuck - she was rightfully upset as that was her friend if nothing else. She told me that I don\u2019t have a right to opinion on him which is fair I don\u2019t. And after that it was kind of a let\u2019s just not talk about him. We kinda didn\u2019t talk much at all.\nShe called me this week breaking down crazy because they got into a toxic fight- turns out she bought him the car with the idea that he would pay the payments (he hasn\u2019t) she is paying his car insurance and gas money every other day so he can pick up money via DoorDash work. She hasn\u2019t been telling me how bad it is because I am judgmental. \nThe whole mess of it is he is definitely financial abusing her and she still wants him to just be with her and cuddle or some shit. \nHer self esteem is in the literal gutter and I don\u2019t know how to help at all. \nLast night she calls at like 1030 and asks me to go get him from some persons house in our city because he locked himself out of his car door dashing and it is cold. \nI asked her why she just didn\u2019t have him call triple a, she said they are going to use mine for the unlock but asked me to go let him sit in the car with me for warmth. \nI told her I was pretty uncomfortable with that aspect of it and would have to \u201cfix my face\u201d because I don\u2019t like him.  I basically said this is awkward because I don\u2019t like him because he is actively fucking up your life.  I was down to send a car to him or set up triple a. But before I really got into other options she said, \u201cfine I\u2019ll call my cousin and then hung up on me.\u201d\nI get that nice people don\u2019t let someone hang out in the cold but with all the stuff she has shared lately about him and their situation I don\u2019t understand why she thinks I would be down. \nI didn\u2019t call back because I was kinda done with his whole mess and I didn\u2019t feel like saying sorry when I am not.\nI understand that I am not nice but am I an asshole to not help him? \nShould I have done it different? \nI am not even sure why she is that mad but I know she is. \nI feel like just taking a step back from the whole friendship and just not following up because I am freaked out about not understanding the relationship situation. I am 40 she is 31 and he is 29.  I don\u2019t date and am pretty upfront with friendships about communication expectations due to the whole autism thing. ",
