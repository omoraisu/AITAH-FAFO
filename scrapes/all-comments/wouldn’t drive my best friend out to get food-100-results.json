      "selftext": "okay so me (20F) and my best friend (20F) have been friends for 8+ years and i\u2019m closer to her than my sister. however, something irritating that happens is that before she comes over, she asks what me and my family are having for dinner (i still live at home bc rent is way too high, and she doesn\u2019t as her parents pay for some of her living expenses and her house). \n\nif we\u2019re having something she doesn\u2019t like or we\u2019re not really having anything (the most probable thing recently since my family is pretty busy w/ x-mas coming up), she just comes over anyway and since it\u2019s a 30 minute drive from her house to mine, i drive her into the next town about 15 minutes away to get a fast food dinner she\u2019ll like (she pays for herself to clarify). that\u2019s fine, and it\u2019s gotten to the point where she refuses to come over unless she has a source of food for dinner (which i also get bc she doesn\u2019t have that much of an appetite so it is her only meal of the day). \n\nbut today, shes staying home because i don\u2019t want to drive her an extra 20 minutes to get food from a chain that\u2019s only 10-15 minutes away from her house in her town, because as a college student, she can\u2019t really afford to drive that much somewhere and her parents don\u2019t give her money to (only for groceries). she said that when i don\u2019t want the dinner at her house, we just go to a fast food place near her house and do the same thing, but i can count about 2 times that has ever happened (which i don\u2019t really want to consider seeing as almost 99% of the time when we drive around in her town, again, i\u2019m the one driving in my car w her as passenger, whereas im still expected to drive when she comes over b/c she \u201calready drove a lot\u201d). \n\ni just feel like she\u2019s viewing everything from a her perspective, and she uses the excuse that my parents pay for my gas whenever i try to bring it up, but just because i dont directly pay for it, my parents are middle class and not made out of money, whereas hers are very wealthy (they don\u2019t give her much at all, but they pay her rent during the school year.) i can\u2019t be nonchalant with my parents\u2019 money like she can because there is a definite end for mine. she thinks its fine for me to drive everywhere in her town because im there most of the time anyway since its where our university is located, but she doesn\u2019t seem to realize that god awful drive she hates is one that i have to slug through every day only for her to ask me to drive everywhere. \n\nshe\u2019s denying that she\u2019s upset, but she\u2019s accused me of being selfish before with little things like this, and i can tell she\u2019s pouting about it. i will admit that she\u2019s been coming to my house a lot more recently than i have to hers but she doesn\u2019t seem to realize i don\u2019t just teleport to her house.\n\nam i the asshole? i know it\u2019s kind of silly and very \u201cwho gives a shit\u201d about such a small thing but it builds and builds to a point where it feels like i\u2019m her chauffeur at a certain point. i don\u2019t want to be selfish and her friendship means the world to me, so i genuinely just want to know from an unbiased perspective if im just being stingy or self centered. \n\n",
