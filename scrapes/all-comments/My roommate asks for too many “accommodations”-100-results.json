      "selftext": "I want to preface with I\u2019m not great at storytelling. \n\nWhen I interviewed for the house, the only thing that was said about needs/accommodations was low scented cleaning products and \u201clight use\u201d around drugs. Nothing specified, no further communication, I didn\u2019t expect it to grow in to anything difficult. They\u2019ve slowly started to complain about more and more. House of 5- we\u2019re asked to text a group chat when ever we use a blender or vacuum. They throw out NON scented cleaning sprays, others products that are too strong for them, complain about weed smell regardless of the frequency. They don\u2019t contribute to buying cleaning products, they just throw out what others buy if they don\u2019t like it. When I first moved in 6 months ago, I strictly wouldn\u2019t smoke inside and just me grabbing my weed and leaving was \u201ctoo strong of a smell\u201d. Since it\u2019s getting colder and I have physical disabilities that weed helps with, I\u2019ve started to smoke out my window with an air purifier as well. I\u2019ll still go for a walk if I can but that\u2019s not always a thing I can do. I\u2019m also just tired of making so many accommodations when they have no flexibility with my, or others needs or accommodations. They stomp through out the house and wave it off as anxiety. They have piles of trash all throughout the house and don\u2019t clean up after themselves. Multiple roommates have offered to help them clean up their stuff and it\u2019s not accepted. We\u2019ve tried to clear out trash from old roommates but they always \u201cwant to keep it\u201d or return it to the person. Past roommates have been contacted and they\u2019ve said they don\u2019t have anything here or they specify they don\u2019t want the item. The smell of mold from their room and belongings is horrible. When they do end up showering, the bathroom wreaks of urine. They have actively lied about COVID precautions (this house was advertised as a COVID conscious house). They hardly ever clean and when they do (because it\u2019s brought to their attention) they burn themselves out detailing a small area of the house and then stop cleaning for multiple months. They avoid accountability when they are called out and play the victim. They complain- worrying about mold but also actively stop others from taking action to clear out the house. And the first step to mold remediation is us cleaning ourselves. Every solution anyone has brought up to them, they pushback and it\u2019s exhausting fighting for my needs/boundaries to be respected. 2 new people have moved in recently and since they\u2019ve moved in the complaints have slimmed but since, they\u2019ve also not been able to pay rent, don\u2019t foresee being able to pay next months rent, and complaints have started to come back. The new roommates have not been asked to not smoke in the house (one roommate has told them to their face that they\u2019re going to go smoke in their room and will smoke on the porch) \n\nThe other roommate has a cat (bad roommate has prevented others from getting pets due to the \u201csmell of pets\u201d). I was struggling to eat enough and wanted a second fridge (because 1 fridge for 6 people - now 5 seems ridiculous) and it got pushed back due to how much it would raise the power bill. I get that everyone living in this house should be able to have things throughout the house but they take up so much space to where no one can functionally use the space.\n\nAitah for smoking out my window when bad roommate refuses to accommodate my needs (fridge, cleaning up after themselves, cleaning period, removing piles from common areas, stinking up house with BO and mold) but also hold me to their needs while not asking that of others? And not trying to accommodate themselves first?\n\nHow do I tell them no, I will not be controlled in my room when I pay my rent. 4/5 roommates smoke or are ok with the smell. \n\nI also understand that this is absolutely a mental health issue. Others and myself have talked about multiple ways to help them and it goes no where. \n\nAdvise? Options? I can\u2019t afford to move out ",
