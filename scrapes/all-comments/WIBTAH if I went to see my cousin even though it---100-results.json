      "selftext": "I (18f) have a cousin \u2018A\u2019 who I haven\u2019t seen but have kept in contact with for 6 years and she\u2019s a close friend who I want to see badly. I was supposed to see her last year however it blew up and my dad (mom and dad divorced) tried to get involved to turn it into a huge scheme to get me up there for months so it got called off.\n\n I\u2019m legally an adult now so there\u2019s no custody agreement and less chance for someone to file false kidnapping charges so I asked A\u2019s dad if I\u2019m still welcome and ofc he and his wife said I am and they\u2019ll pay for the ticket. The rule is my dad stays out of it and doesn\u2019t know. Here\u2019s where it goes bad\n\nI wanted to keep very few people aware of it but my sister mentioned to my mom that my brother could get me a cheaper flight since he might have deals. My mother got excited and said she\u2019d ask and when I tried to say eeeehh maybe we shouldn\u2019t get him involved she said she\u2019d just ask to see. He flipped. Everyone in the family calls him when something happens and he deals with the fallout because he\u2019s the oldest, most involved, and honestly he just doesn\u2019t set boundaries. He freaked out on my mom and now everyone\u2019s high stress and my sister and brother are pissed that id do this\n\nIt\u2019s selfish but my dad showed up for a visit a few weeks ago and we caught him drinking again. He\u2019s a struggling alcoholic who relapsed just before showing up and we found vodka in his room. I found out what my family here says behind my back, I feel tired and like a burden around here and want to go somewhere with people excited to see me and finally see my best friend after 6 years. \n\nI\u2019ve had trips canceled so many times and been unable to do so much because oooo no that can cause fallout with your dad and I\u2019m just so fed up with not being able to live my life because my brother won\u2019t set boundaries with toxic family and my dads\u2026 well. My dad. I do love him but he has his flaws. \n\nI figured I could text my dad (can\u2019t call cause he rarely answers his phone) to say basically \u201chey I\u2019m going to see family near you but there\u2019s not enough time to see you as well. I\u2019ll see you next visit I hope. Love you\u201d (not exactly that but close enough). I texted my brother my message to get confirmation I can send it but he shut down and hasn\u2019t replied. \n\nI\u2019m so stressed and just wanted to do something I wanted to do without people who shit talk me behind my back being involved but I ofc had to tell my mom and from there my sister knew since she lives here and she suggested my brother and now this. I\u2019m tired and want to cancel but my partner says I should just do something for me for once. What\u2019s the right choice now?",
