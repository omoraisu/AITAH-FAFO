      "selftext": "So, I had a salon appointment scheduled for 8 a.m., but thanks to some construction, I ended up being late and got there at 8:23. I called ahead to let them know I was running behind, but when I walked in, my stylist was already working on someone else. Okay, fine, my bad for being late. I sat down and waited.\n\nThing is, she finished with that client and then brought *another* person to her chair, completely ignoring me. Everyone in the shop was kind of giving her those subtle hints, like glancing at me or trying to remind her I was there, but she kept it moving. She didn\u2019t get to me until she finished with the second person.\n\nBy this time, it's almost 10:00.\n\nNow, my friends are saying I\u2019m the one in the wrong because I was late, and I kind of get that. But I feel like I booked that time slot and no one else should\u2019ve been there. If it ran over into someone else\u2019s appointment because of my lateness, then sure, I\u2019d understand waiting to be fit in. But this felt like she just skipped over me completely.  \nAnd there should have been no one in the chair at 8;23 if I had an 8:00 apt, because how would they have known I was going to be late? That means she already double-booked and was just gonna do whichever one of us first, but if I took the time out to schedule the appointment, do I not get first dibs? Why was anyone else even there? \n\nIn the end, I told her I wouldn\u2019t be coming back, and now I\u2019m second-guessing myself. So, AITA?",
