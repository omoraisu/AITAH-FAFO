      "selftext": "We are both writing this post to settle a dispute. I (33M) sometimes need to organize game sessions with friends. Sending a simple message. My girlfriend (31F) thinks it's rude to arrange a game session while we're hanging out together. I tried to explain that i'm only doing so to organize my time AFTER our hanging out time. But she feels like (her words she's next to me) i'm not respecting hers and our time together. As an example i mentioned being out for a coffee/beer with a friend and texting someone else about your next destination/plans (not abandoning said friend or cutting your meet-up short). \n\nTo be more specific, yesterday when were chilling on the couch, watching TV and i asked her whether she would head to bed soon, because i was thinking about gaming in half an hour. She was then upset and felt like i was not respecting her time. She felt pressured that our hang-out time had a time limit and that i was being rude. I didn't actually text anyone, (that's why i always ask her about her plans first).\n\n  \nSo, AITA?\n\n\n\n ",
