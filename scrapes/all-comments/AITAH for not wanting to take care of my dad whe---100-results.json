      "selftext": "In the last few years my dad (53) has managed to make all three of his kids (including me) and my mom isolate him. i (24 F) pity him and feel torn because the whole house has become cold to him and honestly neither of my siblings or me want to take care of him when he gets old. Thats such a miserable life to lose all that you built up and I feel torn on if I should give up on him.\n\n-When my grandfather (mom side) passed away, not only did he not comfort my mom, my dad accuses her of taking over the funeral management and that she should listen to her brother more, saying \u201cjust because she has a degree she shouldn\u2019t assume she knows everything\u201d.\n\n-He made a joke in front of dinner guests about how \u201cthe dish is as tender as the eldest daughter\u2019s thigh\u201d (that would be me, i was creeped out because what a weird ass thing to say)\n\n-When he is with us, he scrolls all day on his phone. We don\u2019t entrust him to do grocery or dishwashing or cooking because he performs them so badly. My mom asks him to follow a recipe and he never does.\n\n-my youngest sister (15) usually criticizes him for driving too slow to school. So once on a highway he started speeding and swirling and made my mom and my youngest sister felt unsafe. They told him about this and he felt that he didnt do anything wrong. \n\n-he smokes and my youngest sister (15) really doesnt like that for the sake of his health, she has tried to get him to quit multiple times. He doesnt take her efforts seriously and thinks its funny.\n\n-recently did I find out he was also responsible for a huge debt from a bank loan and caused my aunt, who was his guarantor, to almost lose her entire pension. Not only did my dad never apologize for it, my aunt and him got into an argument in a car and he dropped her off in the middle of the road. \n\n-my aunt and my uncle took up equal parts in taking care of my grandfather (dad side), when my grandfather passed away, my dad presided (even though he rarely took up the caretaking) that only the brother should get all of the inheritance (even if it wasnt much). So my aunt didnt get anything. \n\n-He bought a whole new patch of property for himself to live in even though we do have a house 30 minutes drive away. The new property is a money sinkhole because its a bare farmland, he wont rent it out because his reasoning was that he wants to leave it for a \u201cgrand gallery for our artwork\u201d. None of us asked for it btw. He wants to leave the property to us but it literally loses more money than it earns. He is also looking at more houses and farmlands now to buy currently. \n\n-He is also really into AI, chatGPT, crypto, apple vision pro etc. If that gives some sense.\n\n-My mom has to take care of all his health insurance and basic calls because he doesn\u2019t speak English well and does not want to learn, even though he is the one trying to immigrate. He would answer important calls sometimes and hangs up pretending he knows what was said rather than ask for clarification. \n\n-I personally think my mom and dad should get divorced because they argue a lot and he honestly isnt contributing to the family on neither chores or finance atp. My mom already said to him that he can do whatever he want with his money but he cannot touch ours. My mom wont consider divorce (stigma ig) and she is still forgiving and hoping that he would change, despite the shit he says to her and constantly belittling her and making her feel dumb (she is the one with a degree in IT) \n\n-My dad also tried to pit my mom against us three. He said to her that when she gets old that none of the kids would ever care for both of them, that they are all each other has got. \n\nThe thing I dont understand is that he wasn\u2019t always this way. Even though he wasn\u2019t present much in earlier childhood due to overseas work, I felt like he was at least \u201cnormal\u201d before and I dont hold grudge for him for that. I also feel guilty because financially he and my mom did support all three of us all the way. Why is he kind of\u2026delusional???\n\nIdk, am i too harsh on him? It seems all the things i list are so case specific and maybe im being too petty?? Is this just a phase/midlife crisis?? I mean i wish he would hit the gym honestly and have a hobby or idk get invested in something but the only thing he ever follows through now is scrolling on his phone. \n\nTldr: dad buys property and wastes money, is sexist, on his phone all day, my mom takes care of him like a man child yet he belittles her. AITAH for not wanting to take of him when hes old and wanting to give up on him? \n",
