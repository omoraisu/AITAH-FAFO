      "selftext": "To start, my fianc\u00e9 (20) and I (20) have been together for four years. We both come from military families, and he recently left for basic training a little over a month ago. This experience, among other reasons, has led us to decide to get married sooner rather than later. Despite some differences, we\u2019ve always managed to work through them maturely. He will be home for Christmas, and we\u2019re considering tying the knot during that break, allowing me to move with him when he starts AIT, as his MOS permits.\n\nWe've had many discussions about important topics such as finances, goals, religion, expectations, and political views, and I appreciate his hardworking, respectful, and positive nature. However, there\u2019s one significant issue that I\u2019m struggling to come to terms with\u2014his family.\n\nTo provide some background, I come from a small family and have learned that those who mistreat you often continue to do so. This belief contributes to my feelings that he should distance himself from his family. My own experiences have shown me how problematic family dynamics can hinder the establishment of a healthy relationship. I don\u2019t want to find myself in a situation where my partner fails to stand up for us, as I have witnessed in my own family.\n\nThe most pressing concern is that his father has been withdrawing money from my fianc\u00e9's bank account\u2014over $500 since he left for basic training, including a recent $100 withdrawal just yesterday. His father has no permission to access this money, which is possible because he is a joint account holder from when my fianc\u00e9 was a minor. While I have access to help pay off my fianc\u00e9's loans, he is understandably upset about the unauthorized withdrawals. He has yet to inform his father about his plans to come home for Christmas, and I\u2019m uncertain about how this visit will unfold.\n\nThroughout his teenage years, my fianc\u00e9 was expected to prioritize his family\u2019s needs over his own, often being criticized for not meeting their demands. Despite this, his family has never provided him any financial support. They have made him feel worthless and have even kicked him out multiple times, leaving him reliant on friends and I for support.\n\nCompounding the issue, I recently learned that my fianc\u00e9's younger brother, whom I helped get a job at my workplace, has been spreading gossip about me\u2014suggesting that I\u2019m not good enough for my fianc\u00e9 and questioning my loyalty. It\u2019s frustrating to see how their negativity impacts my personal and professional life, especially when I don't engage with them.\n\nI understand that my fianc\u00e9's family represents a part of his life, particularly since he lost his mother at a young age. However, I struggle with the idea of staying in a relationship where he maintains ties with people who disrespect him and, by extension, disrespect me. \n\nAm I wrong to want him to evaluate his choices regarding his family? Is it unreasonable for me to ask him to prioritize our relationship over unhealthy family dynamics? Friends and family who know a bit about the situation understand my concerns, but they also believe he needs to make this decision independently. My mother, who understands these struggles, fully supports my viewpoint.\n\nI\u2019m hoping to find some advice on how to communicate my feelings to my fianc\u00e9 effectively and navigate this.",
