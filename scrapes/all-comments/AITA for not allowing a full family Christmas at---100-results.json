      "selftext": "My sister (32f), \u201cK\u201d has not spoken to or had a relationship with our other sister (37f) \u201cA\u201d since our mom died in a car accident in early 2023. At the time of her passing, A had taken advantage of our mother financially and has generally been a very divisive/drama-causing person in our family our whole lives.\nK went no contact with A shortly after our mother\u2019s passing and does not intend to reconcile that relationship.\nI (26f) have a very cordial, surface level relationship with A and we are very pleasant to each other and text often but aren\u2019t super close.\nAt first, A was very combative about this and tried pushing K to reconcile with her but now (seemingly) understands that she did really awful things and is at peace with K\u2019s decision to not have that relationship with her.\nAlmost one month ago, K\u2019s abusive husband threatened her life in front of her children. My husband and I took her and her children into our home and are letting them live here and long as necessary until K can get back on her feet. This has been incredibly traumatic for the kids and our current mission in life is to help with their healing and keep them in a stable and loving environment.\nOur father (74m), whom A lives with, has tolerated the separate holidays without A involved since our mother\u2019s passing, but has decided that this Christmas A must be included no matter what and is insisting on having a family Christmas with everyone present at my home. \nA makes K\u2019s children very uncomfortable due to past family drama and my husband and I are putting our foot down that A may not come to our home on Christmas. We are happy to spend Christmas Eve at my father and A\u2019s home, but we are not willing to make K and her children uncomfortable on Christmas. If he chooses to break relationship with me because of this, I am at peace with that.\nSo AITA for not allowing my father to demand a big happy family Christmas that will ultimately be awkward and uncomfortable for everyone but him?",
