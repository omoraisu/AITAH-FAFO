      "selftext": "I (28M) am getting married in a few months to my fianc\u00e9e Sarah (27F). We've been together for five years, and everything is going great \u2014 except for one thing: my relationship with my mom.\n\nMy mom, Elaine (55F), has always been a bit critical and overbearing, but it\u2019s become worse since I started dating Sarah. Sarah and I are very different in many ways \u2014 culturally, socially, and even politically. My mom has made it clear that she doesn't approve of Sarah, and over the years, she\u2019s said some pretty hurtful things to her. At first, Sarah would try to be polite, but after a while, the comments started affecting her self-esteem. My mom has called her \"too different\" for me, criticized her appearance, and made comments about how she thinks Sarah\u2019s not \"good enough\" for me.\n\nI\u2019ve had several talks with my mom, asking her to stop being rude to Sarah and to respect our relationship. Every time, she promises she\u2019ll try, but it always ends the same \u2014 my mom subtly insulting Sarah or treating her like she\u2019s inferior. A few weeks ago, during a family dinner, Sarah finally snapped and told my mom that she wouldn\u2019t tolerate being disrespected anymore. My mom got really offended and accused Sarah of being too sensitive.\n\nThis brings me to the wedding. I\u2019ve been planning it for months, and I\u2019ve been trying to keep the peace, but I\u2019ve made it clear to my mom that if she can\u2019t respect Sarah, she won\u2019t be invited to the wedding. I told her that I\u2019m not going to put Sarah through the stress of having someone who\u2019s constantly rude to her at our wedding day. My mom is absolutely furious. She\u2019s saying I\u2019m choosing Sarah over my own family and that it\u2019s my responsibility to \"fix things\" between them. She\u2019s now threatening to not attend the wedding at all, saying that if I go through with this decision, she\u2019ll \"never forgive me.\"\n\nSo, AITA for not inviting my mom to my wedding because she can\u2019t respect my fianc\u00e9e?",
