      "selftext": "AITA: my step daughter was home for the weekend. She has a history of bad behavior. I.e. (locking my son in a closet and stranglng him when he refused to play with her). So today I over hear her threatening him she said \" I'm going to beat the shit out of you\" then proceeded to slap him and laugh like she thinks it's funny. It's not and I'm 100% over it. All weekend long we've had to tell her to keep her hands to herself. I have had enough. I get onto her and tell her 1. She shouldn't be using that kind of language and 2. She doesn't need to be putting her hands on anyone nor threatening anyone. A little while later I here my son tell my 5 year old to not go near their sister because she was watching something inappropriate on her phone. ( we have set house rules about phone usage such as. No TikTok no Snapchat no social media of any kind. They are 12) I go to ask her what she's watching and she fumbles around for an answer and exclaims I'm playing mobile games! So I ask okay what game? Again she repeats just mobiles games. I became frustrated at the fact she wouldn't give me a full answer and told her to knock the crap off because I believed she was lying to me. (She has a history of doing this along with inappropriate behavior using her phone like catfishing random people and drawing explicit pictures and sending them to people.) It was then I went to her dad and told him that I think it's time she go home. (She was going home today anyway. It was only about 3 hours earlier than we had planned.) At this point she's crying because she knows if she cries she can manipulate her dad into getting whatever she wants. He's frustrated, I'm frustrated, it is a frustrated situation. He then smarts off \"You are the reason she doesn't want to see me, \" \nWe literally just had our 8 year anniversary yesterday. I've been here for a hot minute and have put up with a lot of shit from this girl and I'm over it. Especially when it comes down to protecting my other children. AITA for wanting her to go home early? ",
