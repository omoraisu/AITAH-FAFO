      "selftext": "I (35F) and my stepdaughter (R, 19F) had a 'fight'.\n\n\nContext.\nThanksgiving came around and my stepdaughter spent it with us. Her mother and her husband had decided to go on vacation and didn't invite her. Her dad told her to come to us. I didn't mind, as I and R didn't have any issues. She'd met me a few times before and I thought we got along. She's a very pretty, smart young girl, despite not having a job or being in college. Now, R has not seen me since before we had our twin girls (3) almost four years ago. Back then I was very tiny, but due to the weight I gained from the twins, and my pregnancy now, I'm about forty pounds heavier. The weight just didn't want to fall off, and honestly, I kind of liked it. Anyway, Thanksgiving was only us and R. R came in and immediately made a face at me, like she didn't know who I was. After a moment she gave me a short hug and was like 'You, M?'. Okay, she'd not seen me in almost three years, it's okay, and I laughed it off. Throughout dinner, R kept staring at me, and even gave me a few backhanded compliments. Like 'You've changed', 'The gap between your thighs are nonexistent!' And etc. My husband was clearly agitated but didn't say anything, and I grew quieter and quieter. The twins even caught on and my eldest, S, even told her to shut up. \n\nThis set R off\n\nR jumps up and tries to jump over the table to where the twins and I were sat, to get to my THREE year old. I immediately jump up and sort of, yank her away from my kids onto the floor. I back away after, apologizing. R doesn\u2019t care, she jumps up and attacks me like a wet cat. She claws my face, attacking my bump, and kneeing me wherever she can get. I shove her off me, yank my twins up, and run into the kitchen. They are screaming, my stomach was cramping, and my nose was obviously bleeding. My husband and she were yelling. I called the police.\n\nThey get there and I decide to not press charges, but by this time I am whizzed off. I tell them I want her gone and a restraining order if she doesn't want me to press charges before I take my kids with me to the ER. I leave my husband to take care of the rest. I had to go on bed rest for a while, as my daughter had experienced extreme distress, my nose was broken, and my foot was sprained (not because of her, I tripped on my way out of the kitchen). My husband felt bad, but he told me he didn't want me to go through with the restraining order and that I WTA to call the cops. That I was overreacting. This gave me flashbacks and I felt like I was being manipulated and talked down to. I took my twins and I left. It's been about a week and so and I'm back home, but I'm starting to think I might have overreacted. She came to us struggling and I didn't control my kids. But, did she have a right to attack me? My husband is mad, her mom called me to tell me what an asshole I am, and she's telling people I started it. I don't have friends. I feel like I'm 24 and stuck again. AITA? What do I do?\n\nContext before context:\n\n\nEdit: my stepdaughter didn't have any interest in living with or visiting us beyond a few phone calls with her dad. She prefers living with her mom and they live two states away *but they have a home near us where R was going to stay with a few friends after Thanksgiving \n\nEdit 2: I cannot leave my husband, he's my financial dependant. I'm trying to but I have to think of my children. I have another year of college to go. Do I need to do a full context?? I didn't want to throw a pity party but I don't think you guys are understanding. :(( or maybe I'm just not getting it.\n\n\nEdit 3 context before context (?)\n\nI was 18 when I married my first husband. He was almost three times my age and he was very physically and emotionally abusive. He didn\u2019t give a dang about me. I suffered two miscarriages, attempted suicide, and ran away after. My husband (P, 44) was the first man who cared about me. I was seeing another therapist after my messy divorce where he worked. He took care of me and set up for future education. I got my GED the year we met, and started college soon after. Up until now he's been nothing like my ex partner.\n\n\nEdit 4: I've read almost all your comments, and I've decided to move into a hotel for a few nights with my twins. Me and my husband will be going to dinner tonight or tomorrow night to discuss this situation. He says there's more to the story than what he's told me. Keep you guys posted. Thank you.",

Again, we have no idea what the actual situation is in their family, but its not out of the realm of possibility for OP to be telling the truth. NTA, OP. Please press charges. If she jumped over the table to attack a THREE year old and beat on your pregnant stomach, who knows what else shes capable of.</p>\n</div>",

The fact that she's not in school and not employed means that her mom is not supporting her or urging her to be more independent.

Mom fucks off on a trip with the new husband without her (and she's an adult so I get that) but then goes to dad's house where he's happily making children with his new wife (you). I think she justified this somewhat as you being an upgrade in comparison to her mom. She probably didn't like it but thought she understood from a shallow male standpoint.\n\nBut then she sees you with the baby weight and realizes its not shallow male shit but a real relationship and feels betrayed. Because this means her parents went out and found a happiness that doesn't include her. And there's nothing she can do. She's 19. An adult. She can't be the thing that holds her parents together or even apparently hold their attention anymore.\n\nHer attack feels like heavily repressed jealousy. I would actually recommend sitting down and talking to her with her dad present (just in case) and ask how she's living with her mother. Is the mom or stepdad helping her get an education, pushing for her to get a job at all (hard to do these days without a two-year degree minimum)? Do they treat her like a burden? Does mom constantly talk shit about you and her ex?\n\nI know it'll be hard but I think giving her a crumb of consideration will possibly help her since she is obviously only barely maintaining socially.\n\nYou're NTA for calling the cops. Emotions were high and you didn't press charges. I also don't think you should divorce your husband unless things escalate. I realize his behavior triggered you, but let cooler heads prevail.

What do they know? Is he a good dad to your toddlers? A good husband?  What do these people writing advice know about your relationship outside this one particular instance.\nI imagine your husband feels stuck in the middle parenting children from 2 different marriages. If it has been 3 years since he had seen his oldest then he was probably hoping to reconnect with her. \nThe violence is unacceptable, however, and not the kind of behavior the toddlers should be witness to.  If you think there's a chance she might come back around then of course get a restraining order. If you have to file charges to obtain the restraining order then that's what you should do.\nTell your husband you understand if he wants to keep in touch with his eldest daughter. Perhaps he can encourage her to get some counseling, if appropriate. She needs to learn that attacking babies is wildly inappropriate and not tolerated. \nSorry your Thanksgiving was ruined in that way.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Your step daughter has issues and a restraining order would not be unreasonable, but will be inflammatory. If it was my husband I would tell him she&#39;s not welcome in your home based on her behavior and if you would like to continue to see her it needs to be elsewhere because you&#39;re not comfortable with putting the twins at risk.\nBTW, I disagree with people who say &quot;divorce your husband&quot;. What do they know? Is he a good dad to your toddlers? A good husband?  What do these people writing advice know about your relationship outside this one particular instance.\nI imagine your husband feels stuck in the middle parenting children from 2 different marriages. If it has been 3 years since he had seen his oldest then he was probably hoping to reconnect with her. \nThe violence is unacceptable, however, and not the kind of behavior the toddlers should be witness to.  If you think there&#39;s a chance she might come back around then of course get a restraining order. If you have to file charges to obtain the restraining order then that&#39;s what you should do.\nTell your husband you understand if he wants to keep in touch with his eldest daughter. Perhaps he can encourage her to get some counseling, if appropriate. She needs to learn that attacking babies is wildly inappropriate and not tolerated. \nSorry your Thanksgiving was ruined in that way.</p>\n</div>",
