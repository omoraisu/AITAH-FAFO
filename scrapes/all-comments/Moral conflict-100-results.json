      "selftext": "Ok so recently a tiny little kitten came out from under my van and ran up to me and my family. He was like maybe 5 weeks old and weighed 3 lbs on the dot. I took him to a vet and found out he was riddled in fleas and ear mites and malnourished. I have since decided to keep him and nourish him back to health. Now here is my dilemma. My neighbors left town for the last 4 days straight(weather has gotten cold af) and now that they are back they've been going around looking for a lost kitten(described very similar to the guy I found). I'm not torn on giving the cat to them. That won't happen as they obviously were not taking care of it, but their special needs grandson is who the cat was for and I feel terrible knowing that he won't get his kitten because they don't know how to take care of animals. It's worth mentioning their house is full of strays in their yard, which looks like a junk yard. They also have at least 3 dogs all of which don't look healthy and let themselves in and out of the house and all of the neighbors trash. AITAH for keeping the cat even after finding out who it was intended for? Or am I in the right for keeping the cat where it will be happy and healthy? ",
