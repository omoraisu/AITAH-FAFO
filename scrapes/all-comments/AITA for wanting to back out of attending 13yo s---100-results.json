      "selftext": "Apparently, step son 13 is so enamoured by the father and so in denial about the reasons his mum left his father, that he was more concerned with getting dad's appeoval than how it would affect his mum (and me as her protector) to ha e to be in the same room/space with her abuser. His mum (my wife) left the father due to DV, and even after 8 years he still takes every chance to inflict emotional abuse. \nIm concerned the son is already in training to be just like his dad... \nWould I be the asshole for taking a stand and educating the son on what DV is amd the forms it can take and exactly what his dad did to his mum?\nMum is reluctant to burst her son's bubble &/or doesn't believe she can get through to him because he will defend his father...\nI though son's were enerally fierce defenders of their mums...\nI'm feeling lost and dont know what to do. How can a son deliberately put his mum in a suituation like this, where she will be, at worst, in the firing like of abuse, and at best, triggered by the fathers presence.\n\nFurther note: the father never contributes financially.to anything for either son. No school fees or equipment, uniforms, never invests time or effort in driving either of his sons to any extra carriculars (sports, music lessons, youth group). This year, for that the event/activity this event is to celebrate, we his primary carers have transported said son for 50+hours of travel, paid all fees and equipment required, emotionally and physcially supported, scaffolfded, coordinated and encouraged. The father has done nothing but conset to having less time with said son on some days to allow his regular attendance. His form is to turn up to the cebrations and behave sociopathically but everyone will see a \"proud, supportive dad and a lovely and charming man.\"\nIt makes me ill. I don't want to raise another mini version of his father and the behaviour of inviting both parties to the same event appears to also be a bit sociopathic to me! \nI have been and am still proud of my step-son's achievements, and want to be there to acknowledge and celebrate that, and our sacrifices in sulporting him all year, with him at this event.\nBut more than that I feel I must protect and defend his mother, my wife, and ensure this young man doesn't grow up ignorant of the damage done by DV and specifically, done by his father to his mum.\nAITA for making a stand on this!? \n\n**TL;DR**: Stepson, 13, idolizes his abusive father and seeks his approval, ignoring the impact on his mother (who left due to DV) and stepparent. Concerned stepson may emulate his father. Considering educating stepson on DV, but mother is hesitant. Feeling lost and protective of wife. Father contributes nothing financially or emotionally, yet appears charming to others. Unsure if taking a stand makes me the asshole.\n",

Both of my brothers are older, and have thecsame memorirs that I did with the exceptions of my mom beating me tge most because I was tge only girl,the youngest, and after 2 boys my dad wanted a girl.

Sge kept jumping us from school to school, moved 3 times, and wasnt till court ruling, did we get to see my dad or stepmom. She gave middle brother and I valium when we were small, and not in school, so she could sneak her boyfriend in while my dad was at work. Thats the first time she got caught. Second was after middle brother started school, and 3 times a week she'd take me to bowling. Afterwards she'd meet up with same boyfriend and leave me in the car. Boyfriend walked her down to the car once. I told my dad about our new \"uncle\". One time, after she'd taken us from my dad, she left us with strangers for over 2 weeks while she rode around with her long-haul trucker bf. She left us with these strangers over Christmas, and missed taking us to any family events. She never even bothered to call, or tell us why. My grandmother ( her mom) told us later. Funny thing m- she never paid a dime in child support even though she made good money. My brothers still gravitated to her despite all the shit she pulled on us for years. The list is of things she did was ENDLESS. No matter what she did, they couldn't see her for what she was. Me on the other hand leaned more towards my stepmom.

I can guarantee you the boy is already questioning his own loyalty, but he's fighting it as hardcas he can. He's not stupid, and feels the rejection from his dad not trying to be in his life on a regular basis. Thats why he needs to invite him to this party. Its the only way he gets his attention.
