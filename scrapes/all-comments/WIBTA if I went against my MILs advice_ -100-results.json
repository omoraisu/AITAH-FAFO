      "selftext": "My SIL has been dating a guy who I'll name Gus for over a year, my husband's family have picked up on more and more red flags as time has gone on. Firstly when they originally met at the gym they were both dating other people, SIL broke up with her boyfriend (they only dated 3 months) because she liked Gus more. Gus told her that he would break up with his girlfriend and eventually told SIL that he had done so. Since then he has love bombed her and gaslit her whenever she spots something that doesn't add up. Gus still lives with his \"ex\" as they had bought a house together and he told SIL that he was waiting to be bought out of the house before he moved out. Over SILs birthday weekend he told her that he was at a mental health retreat provided by his work (as his work is a high stress job), he told her that he was having to write journals and have therapy, and told her he'd written a 5 page love letter to her. I could write a book with how many little lies he's told over a span of 1 year.\n\nRecently he's been promising SIL that he would move in with her, but he kept pushing back the date. Well it was supposed to happen on Monday and we just had a gut feeling it wasn't going to happen. SIL showed me his exes Instagram account which was private and she said she wished she could see it. Well I ended up making a fake Instagram account so I could follow her, days later she accepted so I gave the login straight to SIL so we could look together. Well it turns out while he was on the \"mental health retreat\" he was actually on holiday with his \"ex\". And she'd posted a few photos of them together over the past few months. SIL called Gus straight away and confronted him and he admitted that he was still in a relationship and that he supposedly really was going to move in on Monday and \"make it work\". \n\nNow the question is, we've been saying that if we were his \"ex\", we would want to know. MIL is saying that she doesn't think it's a good idea because it would be coming from a place of spite towards him rather than care for her as we don't know her. She has forbidden us from messaging her. SIL has a few friends who have suggested that they would message her to tell her the truth but I'm not sure if they will actually do it. My SIL said she wouldn't be against someone telling her as long as she wasn't aware of it. WIBTA if I were to go against my MILs wishes and tell Gus' \"ex\" that he's been lying to her too? ",
