      "selftext": "So I (14M) have been playing guitar for 5ish years and it\u2019s my passion.\nFor a little bit of context, I have struggled with depression and anxiety, and still do. Guitar is the only thing I care about in this world. And everyone close to me knows it.\n\nA couple months ago, I got a new amp for my guitar (for the guitarists out there, it\u2019s a 20 watt combo, attenuated to 0.5w, with the master volume set to 2), which for you non-guitarists means not loud at all.\nMy mom got really mad at me using it as it was \u201cway too loud\u201d. She suggested that I could play in the basement. I was really into this idea as it meant that I could play a bit louder and not have anyone telling me that it\u2019s too loud.\nThere was no room in my basement at the time, but my mom assured me that she would take care of it. And here\u2019s the thing : it\u2019s been a solid 3 months, and she still hasn\u2019t. And whenever I strike up a conversation about when we could take care of the basement she would not even let me finish my sentence and just get mad at me even mentioning it.\n\nEarlier today, I asked about it again and she absolutely lost her shit (for lack of a better term) and told me that she would never take care of the basement, and that I should get over it.\n\nI have barely talked to her since. I am angry, frustrated and sad at the same time. I just want to curl up into a ball and scream and cry. \n\nShe says that I am overreacting and that it wasn\u2019t the end of the world. So AITAH?",
