      "selftext": "27(f) at the time . Met a guy (29) early this year . \nConnected pretty quickly . Super attractive and easy going . At first it was fun . Within a month he stated how he was looking for something to be serious w me . I took that literal . We hung out practically every day . As we live fairly close to each other . I cut off potentials I was seeing . One night arriving to his place , I noticed pieces of hair on his bed . Confronted him and he stated how it was old hair . I left as he chased after me to reassure me it was old . HOW ?does he not  wash his sheets?\n\nDays he continually asked for forgiveness, that it was old & I eventually gave in. Mistake . \nIt happened yet again after some time . I asked him about it and his face gave me all the answers . I left and this time he admitted he did see someone else . \nI left him alone for weeks. He came back around . Another mistake I made . Gave in to his apologies.\nUntil the last straw . He was seeing multiple woman , and even his ex . And I couldn\u2019t do it anymore . I left . Got my things one night and boy , one week after . I found out I was pregnant . \nMy hormones got the best of me and I ended up telling him , mainly for moral support . He apologized endlessly for the things he did and how he was change. I gave it one week . \nIn the week . All he talked about was his ex , how it could have been any other girl . Seeing red flags I asked him about some messages . Him being upset that I was questioning him, commented how he could push me down the flight of stairs and have it be over with . Also tried to punch my stomach as a joke and then laughed to feel the temp of how I was going to react .\nI had the abortion . AITAH? ",
