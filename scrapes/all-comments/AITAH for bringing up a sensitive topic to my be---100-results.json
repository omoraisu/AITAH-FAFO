      "selftext": "Okay, my friend (F21) and I (F22) are both ridiculously close and always joke around with eachother, a while back her childhood best friend passed away from a accident caused by a drunk driver, and I was a shoulder to cry on which annoyed me at times because that is sometimes all she would talk about but again she was my best friend so l understood and helped her through it in every way. Okay so, Ve went out with some friends and we had a couple of drinks and it was a fun night out but i would like to add this was on he anniversary of his death so i wanted to get her mind off fit and let her have some fun for once so it's not all she would think about, id like to mention I do pretty well with drinking but she really hates when i do drink so i try not to do it much infront of her but this night i really wanted to relive some stress and have a fun time with my friends. I had a couple of shots and she was already getting irritated because I did have to drive back home but i kept reminding her i will be fine and i will not get drunk. Again, we were out with friends so of course we played drinking games and i did get a bit tipsy to which really angered her. She straight up told me \"Can you please stop drinking because you are my ride home? i'd understand if you weren't but you are and i feel uncomfortable\", that obviously angered me because if it was so serious she could of took a uber or asked someone else to take her so i responded with \" I am not going to stop drinking and enjoying this night because you are overreacting about some drinks, just because your friend passed away and now you are always ruining fun because of something that happened in the past\". That made her extremely upset so she rolled her eyes at me and got into a mood (over a small comment, that i did not mean in a rude way) and requested i took her home because this night did not distract her nor did she have any fun. She was making me very upset because she was ruining everybody's fun and being a buzzkill so i responded with \" No you can get a ride home, please stop bothering me\" , she than proceeded to\nsay \" You are being very selfish right now\" and stormed ot of the place, which is crazy because i am nowhere near\n\"selfish\" i've always been there for her.",
