      "selftext": "My (m30) ex gf (f27) and I had been together for a year and a half officially. It was amazing in the beginning. I legitimately thought I had met my soulmate. We had moved in together with plans for the future, and I started to realize a lot of the things she had talked about were actually either not true or only half true. \n\nShe started going through my phone, finding nothing as I was undyingly loyal to this woman. She lied about it profusely until she couldn\u2019t deny it any longer. She claimed I had emotionally cheated on her (I didn\u2019t, had I she would have absolutely confronted me about it). \n\nThe week she moved in she got drunk and was being sad and I tried many ways to pick her up. She wouldn\u2019t do it, and was being avoidant. I told her she might want to just stay with her mom for the night. This caused her to get up and start screaming, she came at me and punched me in the chest multiple times. I extended my arm to get her away from me, grabbing her neck which I immediately let go of because I didn\u2019t want to hurt her. She responded by saying I was trying to kill her and three pieced me in the face busting my lip and hurting my jaw. She proceeded to go into the kitchen and absolutely destroy it. I wouldn\u2019t let her leave at that point because she was both drunk and in complete emotional disarray. \n\nI cleaned it all up. She apologized the next day and I told her that was her first and only strike. I have never been violent with my partners and don\u2019t even like raising my voice.\n\nSome months went by and then we had gone out shopping one day. She said she didn\u2019t like the store we were in, and we left. I was irritated but chose not to talk the whole way home. We get home and I mentioned I thought it was silly, and she became very angry, slamming our bedroom door multiple times until I pushed it open to get her to stop. She pulled my painting (about 4 foot tall) off the wall and swung it at the wall as hard she could breaking it into a million pieces. I told her she needed to leave for the night, which she wouldn\u2019t. Had to call the cops, they gave me the option to send her to jail and I decided not to press charges because I loved her and thought we could work it out. \n\nShe eventually said that she was \u201cjust trying to get away from me\u201d and it was \u201creactionary abuse\u201d which, to me, sounded a lot like \u201cit\u2019s your fault I hit you/destroyed your shit.\u201d She moved out the next two days while I was gone at work. I had changed the locks (she took a bag of stuff with her when she left that morning) because I didn\u2019t want her to take my shit or break anything else, and she snuck in the house thru a window and did exactly what I thought she would do. \n\nImmediately (within 3 days) after we broke up she started seeing someone I used to be close to and a colleague of sorts in my line of work. I ended up finding out she had said some pretty defamatory things on social media about me that were not true the day after we split. I have been in therapy for weeks since it happened and it\u2019s been super hard on my mental health. From her immediately finding someone else, to beating me, to breaking my things, and blaming it all on me.\n\nJust recently I started telling my side of things when I\u2019ve been approached about it. We have some friends in common, and they wanted my side of things. One of these people were that colleague. She messaged me telling me I needed to stop lying about everything and she missed me a lot. I haven\u2019t lied about anything, I also have kept pretty good track of everything that happened. \n\nA lot of the people I have told have been kind of blown away by my side of things. Some have really questioned their friendship with her. The worst part, to me, is the double standard. Had roles been reversed there would be no trial or \u201chearing me out\u201d, I would be an outcast in the community immediately. It\u2019s insane to me that people have needed to take a minute to gather their thoughts on this situation. To me, it seems pretty cut and dry this person is a danger to themselves and to those around them. \n\nAm I the asshole for telling people my side of the story? Should I just hope she does better and gets passed this behavior? I have it on good authority that she has done this to multiple other partners, and she had me block all of her exes as they were \u201ccrazy.\u201d",
