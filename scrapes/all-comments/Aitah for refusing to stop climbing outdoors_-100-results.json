I don't know everything about the relationship, but does your boyfriend do anything else where he controls what you do? Even if not, it might start small like controlling hobbies, and a year and half in, you probably feel attached so he feels safe to start controlling now. \n\nI could be wrong about the whole control, but it's a red flag with how he's voicing his concern as well as the timing of it.
