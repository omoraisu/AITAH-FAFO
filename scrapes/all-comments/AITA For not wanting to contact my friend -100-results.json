      "selftext": "Hello everyone i (17m) have a friend (16f) who suffers from severe mental health issues and nearly every day I have to convince her not commit,SH,under eat,ect. I have spoken with her about getting professional help which she actively refuses and says that I'm better help anyways. Due to our time difference when she has a meltdown which as I said happens nearly every day I cannot afford to sleep untill she has called me and I have calmed her down which leads me to being unable to go to sleep before 4am which has ruined my sleep schedule and is beginning to really tire me out both mentally and physically. \nWould I be the asshole if I cut her off to protect my mental and physical health ?
