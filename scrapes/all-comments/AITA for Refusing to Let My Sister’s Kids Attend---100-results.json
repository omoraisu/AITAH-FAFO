      "selftext": "I\u2019m (24, F) getting married to my fianc\u00e9 (28, M) in a few months, and I\u2019m in the middle of planning everything. I love my sister, Emily (30, F), and we\u2019ve always been close despite our differences. She has three kids (ages 5, 7, and 10), and while I love them, I don\u2019t see them often. The problem is that the last time they visited my house, they left behind a trail of chaos that\u2019s made me question whether I want them at my wedding.\n\nA few months ago, Emily and her kids came to visit for the weekend. I was excited to spend time with them, but as soon as they walked in, things went sideways. They ran through my house, broke a vase, spilled juice on the carpet, and drew on my walls with crayon. I know kids can be messy, but this felt different. When Emily tried to help, the kids ignored her and were more interested in playing. The worst part was when my fianc\u00e9 found one of the kids trying to climb on our dining table, which was a custom piece we saved up for.\n\nWhen they left, my house was in shambles. It took me two days to clean everything up, and I was left feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. I brought it up to Emily, and she said, \u201cKids will be kids,\u201d and that I shouldn\u2019t be so hard on them. I understand kids can be energetic and curious, but it felt like my boundaries were crossed, and my home wasn\u2019t respected.\n\nNow, as I\u2019m planning my wedding, Emily has asked if she and the kids can come. She told me that her kids are excited to see me get married and that they would be on their best behavior. I wanted to say yes, but I can\u2019t forget how they treated my house. I\u2019ve been stressing about it, and I finally told her that I\u2019m not comfortable having them at the wedding. I offered to let her come with her husband or a friend, but she\u2019s upset and says I\u2019m being unreasonable and unfair.\n\nSome of my friends have said I should let it go and let them come. Others say I have every right to set boundaries for my big day. I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m overreacting or if I\u2019m justified in saying no.\n\nAm I the asshole for refusing to let my sister\u2019s kids attend my wedding after the chaos they caused at my house?",

The inappropriate response is to shrug your shoulders and say \u201ckids will be kids\u201d. The appropriate choice is to tell all the kids you\u2019re leaving because they cannot behave in public, put them in the damned car, and take them home - and then hand out punishments from there.  If they can\u2019t act respectfully in public at 5, 7, and 10, then they absolutely do not deserve to indulge in the things they like (I\u2019m guessing tablets and video games given sister\u2019s attitude). \n\nI wouldn\u2019t allow the kids to come, and why, if I were OP - but I would make it crystal clear to her sister that it\u2019s not because of the kids.

However, OP\u2019s wedding is neither the time, nor the place for it. So, because her sister has shown that she refuses to properly parent her feral children, her sister is the reason the kids aren\u2019t invited. \n\nThe blame lies squarely on her, not her children. It\u2019s because of her lack of parenting, her inability to take accountability for her kids\u2019 actions, and her complete disregard for others\u2019 feelings, spaces, and things.  If she had been able to control her kids, or show concern for others\u2019 in general, OP may have considered it.  If I were OP, I would consider telling my sister her kids are never allowed back in my home either.

Kid was chattering away and wiggling. When the overture started, we each laid a hand lightly on the little leg next to us.  Kid sat still and spell bound until intermission.  At that point, the woman turned around and addressed kid, saying she had never seen such a well behaved little kid at a show before.  Turned to us and said she was worried when she walked in, but her concern was unnecessary.  And thanked us for being good parents.  Kid sang on the way to the bathroom and while getting a snack.

And the little one was also clearly ready!   Not sure it would have worked without the touch reminder, but that was all we needed to do!\n\nWithout constant planning and supervision, this child was the sort to stand on tables and leap off, head first. I\u2019ll spare you the multi step trek to find my sewing rotary cutter that landed kid in the ER.  That kind of kid.
