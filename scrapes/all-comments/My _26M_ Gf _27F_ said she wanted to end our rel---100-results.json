      "selftext": "My (27F) girlfriend and I (26M) have been together for just shy of a year. Throughout our relationship, we have had many fights and arguments. We've worked through a lot, but no one has ever cheated or done anything horrible. \n\nWe both expressed before dating that we wanted to push eachother to be better people. She started our relationship going to the gym and meal prepping; something she enjoyed and found made her stable. I wanted to go to the gym everyday and eat healthy, something I had been working on to get back into and doing in the past. I'm currently down 55 pounds from when we first started talking.  \n\nHer last relationship, and only relationship, was with a POS Manchild who was abusive. It's was a few years before that relationship ended and her and I began dating. \n\nEvery time we've argued, I'm always the one at fault. Even when I know it's not my fault, I put myself in her shoes and apologize. I can think of only two times in a year she has owned up to being wrong, but mostly blames me for things that, in my opinion, are not actually because of me. She's expressed frustrations with me bigger things like previously  sleeping too much, not following through, and a host of smaller things.  \n\nRecently we started going to the gym every morning. I've been waking up at 6:00 a.m. to go without problem. We've built a routine in the evenings that's I've had to practically beg her to do. I've expressed it's the only way I can function is to go to bed at a decent hour and get 7 hours of good sleep. She can function on 5 and doesn't seem to understand why I need so much. \n\nThe break-up stems from last night where she told me she was done and checked out. And I explained and expressed to her, after she said some very hurtful things, that I've done everything she's asked. But it's never good enough. \n\nI've told her we're going to the gym, yet she says, \"it's only been 4 days in a row.\" I tell her I've done all the household chores in addition to my physically labor intensive job. It's not good enough. She said it's taken a year and that I've stepped on her and don't care about her by not doing everything she's asked, which I have it's just taken time. \n\nIve:\n-Completely changed my diet to 100% healthy foods\n-Done everything she's asked me to do in regards to making her feel loved.\n-Cut my sleep patterns back from 10-11 hours a day to 7 \n-Keep our apartment in prestine clean (she has OCD) condition \n-Busted butt to make sure her financial needs are met (I pay the entire rent $1600. \n-Quit dipping and am done with nicotine \n-Lost 55 pounds by a year of healthy habits. \n\nToday we woke up and went to the gym like normal. After getting home I made her and I breakfast and I didn't feel good so I laid down (I didn't have work today). I ended up falling asleep for 2 hours. I didn't get much sleep last night because of the argument (about 5 hours if that.) When I woke up, she said she's done. She said she's done because it's a slap in the face to take a nap when she's told me that she sees it as lazy. Even though 95% of everything we've worked so hard for and the routines we've set are in place. \n\nAm I delusional in thinking she's not seeing it clearly? Am I at fault? \n\nHow do I help make her see how far I've come and how much effort I've put in? How do I help her understand that I've overcome so much and set so many healthy habits that me falling asleep isn't purposely a slap in the face to her? \n\nThank you. ",

They feel okay with the relationship itself, it's themselves they aren't happy about. They need you to supply them with the love and praise that they can't give themselves, and therefore they'll feel like you never give them enough.

She was very cold and acted like he was throwing the nice things he does in her face so she would have the excuse not to acknowledge them.
