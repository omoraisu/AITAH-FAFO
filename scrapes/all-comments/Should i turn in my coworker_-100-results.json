      "selftext": "am i doing the right thing by turning in my coworker?\n\ni have had issues with my coworker having any sort of boundaries.  she is 10 years older than i am, and started working with me about 8 months ago. we started out as great friends and even hung out some outside of work but she became very obsessive of me. when i started to realize this, i backed way off which made it worse. she will continuously blow up my phone at all times. eventually i stopped answering but now she constantly texts me asking why im mad at her and if i hate her. unfortunately, i am her boss. she buys me unwanted gifts and has since she started. she is also very touchy with me (i am not a touchy person whatsoever). she\u2019s constantly scratching/ rubbing my back at work, will lay her hands in mine if i even try to hand something to her. if i don\u2019t tell her i love her when we part ways she\u2019ll blow up my phone asking why i won\u2019t say it back. i have been uncomfortable with this for quite some time and finally went to my gm about it. my gm is having me write a statement to send into the company about this situation. i\u2019m beginning to feel really guilty for sending it. i don\u2019t think she realizes how uncomfortable it makes me. she\u2019s constantly following me around while on the clock and only does anything that will please me. i have been very clear that the constant text messages are uncalled for, but she reacts poorly. she makes me feel bad any time i try to speak about these things with her so i have tried to just push off my own comfort. she thinks we are \u201cfriends\u201d and i don\u2019t want her getting fired for this but i thought it should be brought up to the general manager. i don\u2019t think she had any malicious intentions but it all has become too much for me to handle. i\u2019m nervous about send in a statement describing these feelings. am i doing the right thing?
