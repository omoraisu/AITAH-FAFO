      "selftext": "Okay, so I (27F) feel sick even writing this because I never thought it would come to this. My best friend \"Claire\" (27F) and I have been close since high school. She was there for me through everything losing my dad when I was a baby, struggles with my recovery (I'm a recovering alcoholic), and all the usual growing up drama. She was the one person I thought I could trust with anything. I\u2019ve been dating \u201cJake\u201d (29M) for about 6 months now, and it\u2019s been amazing. He\u2019s sweet, supportive, and honestly one of the healthiest relationships I\u2019ve ever had. He knows about my past, my boundaries, and has always been super respectful. Claire met him a couple of times, and she seemed to like him, but something about how she acted at our last hangout just\u2026 didn\u2019t sit right. Last weekend, Jake and I hosted a small dinner party for a few friends, including Claire. Everything seemed normal at first, but as the night went on, Claire started acting kinda weird. She was laughing at everything Jake said, leaning in close to him, and even made this stupid joke like, \u201cIf I had met you first, you\u2019d be mine.\u201d I laughed it off at the time, but it felt... off, you know? The next morning, Jake told me he needed to talk to me about something. He looked so uncomfortable, and my heart immediately sank. He said after I went to bed, Claire followed him into the kitchen and started talking about how \"he deserved better\" and \"wasn't I lucky to have him.\" Then she flat-out told him she\u2019d always wondered what it\u2019d be like to hook up with him. She even tried to kiss him, but Jake shut her down and told her to leave. I felt like the ground was ripped out from under me. I didn\u2019t want to believe it, but Jake has never given me any reason not to trust him. He said he felt guilty even being around her after what happened and that I deserved to know. When I confronted Claire over text (I knew I\u2019d lose it if I called), she denied it. She said Jake must\u2019ve \u201cmisread\u201d her or was making it up to make me distrust her. When I told her I believed him, she flipped out, saying I was insecure, choosing a guy over her, and that I was \u201cthrowing away 10+ years of friendship\u201d for no reason. Now, a few mutual friends are involved because Claire told them her version of the story, and they\u2019re saying I\u2019m overreacting. They\u2019re like, \u201cShe was drunk; it doesn\u2019t mean anything\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t ruin a decade-long friendship over a misunderstanding.\u201d But to me, this doesn\u2019t feel like a misunderstanding. It feels like a betrayal, and I honestly don\u2019t know if I can ever trust her again. I\u2019ve stopped responding to her messages and calls, but now I\u2019m second-guessing myself because so many people are telling me I\u2019m in the wrong. Did I blow this out of proportion?",

Even if she were drunk, that doesn\u2019t excuse inappropriate behavior, especially toward someone she knows is your partner. Alcohol may lower inhibitions, but it doesn\u2019t create feelings or intentions that weren\u2019t already there.\n\nJake did the right thing by shutting her down and being honest with you about what happened. It\u2019s also worth noting that he seems trustworthy\u2014he told you immediately, even though it was uncomfortable, and he didn\u2019t try to brush it off. This is a sign that he respects you and values your relationship.\n\nAs for Claire, her response when confronted is telling. Instead of taking accountability, she doubled down, denied it, and tried to gaslight you by saying Jake \u201cmisread\u201d her or made it up. Then she flipped the script to make herself the victim, claiming you\u2019re \u201cchoosing a guy over her.\u201d This kind of manipulative behavior is not the hallmark of a true friend.\n\nYour mutual friends urging you to let it go might mean well, but they\u2019re not the ones who have to live with this betrayal. Drunken mistakes or misunderstandings might explain small lapses in judgment, but outright hitting on your partner and trying to kiss him is a deliberate and hurtful choice.\n\nTrust is a cornerstone of both friendships and relationships. Claire\u2019s actions and subsequent denial have seriously damaged that trust, and you\u2019re justified in creating distance to protect yourself and your relationship. It\u2019s not about \u201cchoosing\u201d Jake over Claire; it\u2019s about holding people accountable for their behavior and protecting your emotional well-being.

Claire\u2019s actions, as described by Jake, are a significant breach of trust. Even if she were drunk, that doesn\u2019t excuse inappropriate behavior, especially toward someone she knows is your partner. Alcohol may lower inhibitions, but it doesn\u2019t create feelings or intentions that weren\u2019t already there.</p>\n\n<p>Jake did the right thing by shutting her down and being honest with you about what happened. It\u2019s also worth noting that he seems trustworthy\u2014he told you immediately, even though it was uncomfortable, and he didn\u2019t try to brush it off. This is a sign that he respects you and values your relationship.</p>\n\n<p>As for Claire, her response when confronted is telling. Instead of taking accountability, she doubled down, denied it, and tried to gaslight you by saying Jake \u201cmisread\u201d her or made it up. Then she flipped the script to make herself the victim, claiming you\u2019re \u201cchoosing a guy over her.\u201d This kind of manipulative behavior is not the hallmark of a true friend.</p>\n\n<p>Your mutual friends urging you to let it go might mean well, but they\u2019re not the ones who have to live with this betrayal. Drunken mistakes or misunderstandings might explain small lapses in judgment, but outright hitting on your partner and trying to kiss him is a deliberate and hurtful choice.</p>\n\n<p>Trust is a cornerstone of both friendships and relationships. Claire\u2019s actions and subsequent denial have seriously damaged that trust, and you\u2019re justified in creating distance to protect yourself and your relationship. It\u2019s not about \u201cchoosing\u201d Jake over Claire; it\u2019s about holding people accountable for their behavior and protecting your emotional well-being. You\u2019re not blowing this out of proportion\u2014your boundaries matter, and you\u2019re right to enforce them.</p>\n</div>",

Particularly if that&#39;s one of their usual habits when they have sex or hook up. But drinking doesn&#39;t make you say things you don&#39;t already have in your head. In vino veritas and all that. </p>\n\n<p>And <em>Claire</em> is the one who decided to ruin a valued friendship over something as common as simple jealousy concerning a guy. It probably ate at her that her friend with the troubled past is headed towards marriage while she&#39;s looking down the barrel at 30 alone &amp; childless. </p>\n\n<p>NTA and as much as this must have hurt OP to the core, at least she lucked into a decent guy who immediately told her about it. Imagine if he had kept it to himself, but a few years down the road when age &amp; children start slowing the sex life finally gives in to cheat with her? Imagine the damage that could have done.</p>\n</div>",
