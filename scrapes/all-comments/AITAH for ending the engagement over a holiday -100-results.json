      "selftext": "My(37f) (now ex) fiance Ben (35m) broke up last night and apparently i am the a hole and am trying to figure out if i am. \n\nWe were due to fly to another country today for a Christmas break and to have some time to relax. I have had a rough time recently and am doing some pretty intense research so needed a break. I paid for it myself for both of us as he doesn't work. The day before i was quite poorly and was trying to sleep in an attempt to be well enough to go. He kept waking me up so i went downstairs to sleep. He then followed me and stopped me sleeping again being aggy and argumentative so i told him to leave me alone to rest. \n\nCouple of hours later he just got dressed, totally ignored me and went out. This is a boundary i have communicated with him because in the past he threatened to kill himself, threw his phone into a lake and went ghost for weeks. It really messed me up at the time and when he just storms out in a mood i just get scared he is doing the ghost thing again. Anyway its something i have told him is a line for me. I messaged him and asked him what he was doing and he said he was going to his mums. I checked the location app we have an he was in the pub. He stayed in the pub all night.\n\nI was obviously upset about this as I was ill, there was lots to do round the house and we hadn't packed and organised ourself for our trip yet. I was upset I had been lied to and had my boundaries just stepped but he kept belittling the situation and saying I was just mad he woke me up and I'm a nightmare and hard to love and crazy.I just feel so disrespected. I told him i felt like i was being manipulated and it disgusted me. \n\nAnyway it go to about 3 hours before the flight and he was still out and being generally difficult over text. The flight has now been and gone and i have lost the holiday. He is still not home. Ive told him the engagement is off and i cant marry him. Now he is saying im the a hole and im making him homeless (he can move in with hi friend who he lived with before or him mum he isnt homeless). That im crazy and insane for throwing the relationship away but its all because of me this is happening. \n\nAITAH?",
