      "selftext": "So my sister and her husband have 2 kids. One a little over 2, and the other about 6 months old. We all live together and pay bills together,and they're great loving parents, I've seen it, but most days it seems they have far too much of an anger issue towards their kids very normal behavior. The kind of behaviour I'm talking about is: crying, interrupting what you're doing because they want to climb on you/play with you, waking up in the middle of the night upset, and generally being a naive child who isn't following direct clear orders all the time. \n\nI've watched the dad tell the 6 month old baby to \"shut the fuck up\" on multiple occasions(feels like daily) and with such an \"I'm so fucking over this\" look on his face. I've watched him stare death daggers at her as well when she wouldn't go to sleep because he wants to sleep or play his games and he's tired of tending to her. I watch them get angry and threaten to \"bust her ass\"  when the 2 year old wakes up in the middle of the night and doesn't want to go immediately back to bed. \n\nI've watched my sister exhibit similar behavior but instead of getting mad she gets so defeatedly angry and keeps getting an attitude with the kids if they don't just stay quiet and calm ALL day or she throws a micro hissy fit if the baby cries even once when shes doing something she wants to do. Acts as if the baby is somehow TRYING to annoy her\n\n I feel like these are massive overreactions to very normal child behaviour and that a lot of their anger isn't justified. I've watched him put her in the corner for continuously walking in front of his TV, which to me feels like a very unfair reason to be punished because in my mind, watching TV isn't as important as the well-being of your daughter. Playing games and getting interrupted is not a valid reason to lash out at your kid.\n\nSo anyway I confronted my sister and her husband one day after she tried to talk down to her 2 year old about not respecting her and her time (the kid doesn't understand this conversation and just looked lost and confused and scared) I pointed out all of the angry behavior they've been throwing at their very young and inexperienced children and told them I didn't think it was fair for them to get so angry at very normal child-like behaviour and that they needed to have more patience when it comes to dealing with them, that they're not a task to be completed, but people to nurture and that sometimes that means you need to stop thinking about yourself, stop being selfish, and actually pay attention to your kids instead of punishing them for existing in the same space as them. You don't get \"me\" time anymore, you have an adult responsibility to look after your kids, not play fortnite. \n\nWell, she reminded me it's not my house and that if I didn't like it I could leave. She basically threatened to kick me out, even though both of them are off projects right now and I'm the only one with a steady job who can pay the bills right now.\n\nI know they are not my kids, I know raising kids is hard, but I feel like if the behavior I'm seeing twists my stomach it must be wrong, right? Am I the asshole?",
