      "selftext": "So I work at Target and it may not be the most stressful job out there it is hard to get through the day without an energy drink. During my break I was drinking my energy drink and realized I only had a minute left and proceeded to dump out the energy drink into the sink and drinking a little bit of the remaining drink before going back to my shift. Then when I finished my shift at work, after talking to customers for five and a half hours with a small break in-between, I am looking forward to eating my leftover Chinese food from the day and excited about the DNA kit I was prepping the night before that my best friend got me for my Christmas gift since it was on sale on Amazon. After arriving home I see my Christmas gift (a 23 and Me DNA kit) open on the table ripped to pieces, making it so I cannot mail it without buying a whole other DNA kit. I could tell it was my dad who did it because he is very impatient and has a bit of a \"this is my home so any mail that I get regardless of name should be checked by me\" attitude. Additionally, they could have also texted me or called me and ask about the package and ask if they should open it because I always leave my phone notifications on and check my phone on my small break, especially since my dad is unemployed and is constantly on his phone while my mom is the only one who works besides me and my part time Target job. Back to when I saw the DNA kit ripped open, my mom said she was confused what the box was and told me she opened at it and I went off on her. Keep in my mind I told my dad to drop this said DNA kit package at USPS on Monday when he got the chance if he didn't mind but I didn't tell him what was in it because that is my business and I didn't think he would open it without my permission. My mom was therefore angry for me screaming at her (rightfully so) and asked my dad if he knew about the DNA kit package that I wanted him to drop off at USPS and he said he didn\u2019t remember. Convenient of course... then when he said he did not remember I screamed at him for opening the box because 1. it was not his business 2. he claimed it did not have my name on it but that is because it is a DNA kit that is registered under my name so when they scan the barcode on the package they can tell it is my spit in the tube 3. he screamed at me when I was looking for some batteries in his room not too long ago saying that it is his private area and to not go through his things\n\nSo basically, am I the a-hole for screaming at them after a shift with little caffeine and my privacy being invaded for no reason other than he had the \"right\" to since it was his house (even though technically its under my mom's name)?\n\nP.S. I threw out the energy drink because at Target you cannot drink anything besides water in front of the customers so I couldn\u2019t keep it with me while I worked and I had two hours left in my shift so it would gone flat by then\nAlso I threw that detail in there to possibly explain why I potentially may have went off on them because I wasn\u2019t as caffeinated and energetic as I usually was. Not sure if that makes any sense but that\u2019s why I talked about the energy drink (did not think it was that important)",
