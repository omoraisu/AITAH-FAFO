      "selftext": "Im (28f) struggling to breach out of the hands of a controlling African mother. I have a partner (29m) who I\u2019m trying to save for a future with and mind you I came from a 2 months down time from an ankle fracture. \n\nMy mother has this tradition whereby she wants us to do a Christmas photoshoot for showing off purposes with 24h transit and I am very fearful of flying. She asked me to come to Botswana for Christmas and quite frankly I do not want to as I have my own life to work on. \n\nI said it to her that I\u2019ll be home next year but when it comes to this Christmas unfortunately I can\u2019t. She\u2019s a wealthy lady and said she will pay for missed salaries and cost of coming. She has tried to come up with manipulation tactics, in case she d*es blah blah. Mind you I went all the way back home for her birthday this year March, was also home from mid December to end of Jan this year. \n\nHow do I arrest this behaviour? I am a very direct person so this is everything I have told her. I\u2019m not a child anymore and i am liable to my partner, we have goals. It also low key hurts me that im fresh out of an ankle fracture and you want me to experience the nonsense that airports put people through and the major concern is a Christmas portrait??? She said oh even if i can come back for one day. She has no experience with flying internationally btw. ",
