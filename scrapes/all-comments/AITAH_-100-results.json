      "selftext": "First time poster...  My husband & I (60's) have a dilemma about Christmas. We have 2 sons in their 20's, still live at home without GFs. We also have my elderly, disabled sister who lives in a nursing home and my MIL who is almost 87 and lives in a semi-assisted retirement community. She's been there a little over a year and, surprising to us, is becoming hermit-like. Our dilemma is that we want to have a Christmas Eve or Christmas Day with just us and our sons only.  Is it too rude to only have our sis & MIL on Christmas Eve and leave Xmas Day to ourselves? We know my MIL will sit alone in her apartment Xmas Day watching football, she is a sports freak.  My sis will have more people around her in the nursing home, she won't be alone.  Plus, I forgot to mention that sis, because of her disabilities is very hard to move around and get her into our house.  MIL is very frail. We'd like to have them over Xmas Eve, so we can have Xmas Day to ourselves.  My husband & I feel the same way, no problem there. AWTAH for wanting time with just our guys before they get GF's or move away? Are we being selfish? ",
