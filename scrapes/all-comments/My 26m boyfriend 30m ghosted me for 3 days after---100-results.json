      "selftext": "Me and my partner have been dating for one year now and the past month or so he has become seemingly a bit distant not spending as much time with me or making excuses like being ill. \n\nI bought this up at the weekend along with some other things and explained how I was feeling which he didn\u2019t really Make any reasons why but did acknowledge them. We were supposed to have plans on the following Monday but he cancelled two hours before and said I understand how this is going to look And that you will be mad and I replied if I could get a reason as to why he was cancelling and he just has not replied. now two days later and he is still looking at my Instagram stories, etc but still no reply, I have not tried to contact him since either\n\nI\u2019m not sure if this is a sign that I should just end this as there\u2019s clearly something going on (I\u2019ve only been to his house once, and we had a little misunderstanding a month ago and he said he was giving me an \u2018out\u2019 if I wanted it which obviously I did not) \n\nWould you leave him if you were in my situation?\n\nUpdate\n\nHe replied after day 3 and said that I probably wanna break up etc I\u2019ll bring your stuff round, this felt like a break up text so I was like sure whatever and that was that.\n\nHowever in my anger and upset I messaged him a week later saying idk how he could just ghost me and break up over a text after 1 year of being together. Turns out he was just assuming I\u2019d wanna break up with him because of how he handled the situation. he lost his job the day he cancelled and ghosted me and couldn\u2019t face me hence the 3 day silence. I told him I\u2019m sorry about that but I don\u2019t think that kind of communication is healthy you should be able to tell your partners these things so I said we should still be apart. \n\nIt\u2019s only been 3 days since that conversation but I\u2019m starting to wonder if I was being too harsh and reacting to past trauma from my ex who would go silence for weeks at a time. He seems like an amazing guy but I\u2019m worried he is holding back being open and honest with me and this could happen again any time something bad happens. Not sure if I should see if this can work still?",
