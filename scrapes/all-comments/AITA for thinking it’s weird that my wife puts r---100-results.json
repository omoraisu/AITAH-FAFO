      "selftext": "For context, I have a nightshade allergy so we don\u2019t make spaghetti at home because my wife feels bad that I can\u2019t eat it. She mentioned that she\u2019s been craving it a few times this week so I went out and bought the ingredients to make her some. Once I served it, she said she wanted to do something that I\u2019d probably judge her on and think was gross; that something was to put ranch on her spaghetti. My wife grew up really poor and says that they couldn\u2019t afford both Parmesan cheese and ranch. I in-fact did burst out laughing, judging her and telling her it was kinda gross..but then I offered to grab it and told her I\u2019d love her anyway. AITA for thinking ranch and spaghetti is one of the most unholy concoctions known to man?",
