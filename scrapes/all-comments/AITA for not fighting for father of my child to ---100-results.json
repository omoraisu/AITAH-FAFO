      "selftext": "I (23F) had a child with my ex (24M). In the beginning he was excited and wanted to be involved but during the middle of my pregnancy he switched up and turned really mean and switched up. He decided to stop helping all together and not be involved. My baby was born a week ago and he asked to be involved again and so I let him be there for the birth, and he was, but now he hasn\u2019t really asked about her or been involved. He asks about her sometimes. He just texts how\u2019s the baby? and i respond and he doesn\u2019t really show her much interest after that. He hasn\u2019t brought her anything or done much to really be involved. The thing is I don\u2019t really care anymore or care to fight to have him involved. Would I be TA if I just stop replying to his messages and keeping him involved? I still have him on social media and all he posts about is going on dates with multiple girls and spoiling them with gifts and money, but doesn\u2019t for his own daughter. I myself had a dad who was there but wasn\u2019t really there if that makes sense and i don\u2019t want her to go through the same thing. I rather her not grow up with him at all if he\u2019s just going to be coming in and out of her life whenever he feels like it and not showing much interest when he is involved. it feels like he regrets being a father and doesn\u2019t want to be one so i\u2019d rather let him off the hook and just raise her myself and let him find someone he actually wants to be a family with than fight for him to be involved in my babies life.
