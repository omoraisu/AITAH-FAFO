      "selftext": "Hi Reddit, I (18F) live with my mom (42F) and my little brother (5M). My dad passed away a few years ago, so it\u2019s just the three of us. Since then, my mom has had to work a lot to keep us afloat, and I\u2019ve always tried to help out when I can\u2014cooking dinner, watching my brother, cleaning, etc. I didn\u2019t mind because I know she\u2019s doing her best, and I love my brother.\n\nLast weekend, my mom told me I couldn\u2019t go to my best friend\u2019s birthday party because she needed me to babysit. This wasn\u2019t the first time plans got canceled last minute because of babysitting, so I was frustrated and told her I had been looking forward to this for weeks. She said, \u201cToo bad, family comes first.\u201d\n\nSo, I ended up staying home, but I was upset and made it clear I wasn\u2019t happy about it. I still watched my brother and did everything I was supposed to, but I was kind of short with her for the next couple of days.\n\nFast forward to this week: I got invited to hang out with friends after school. My mom said no because I was \u201cbeing disrespectful\u201d last weekend. She grounded me and told me I needed an \u201cattitude adjustment.\u201d\n\nNow here\u2019s where it gets messy. Yesterday, my mom said she needed me to babysit again because her work schedule changed. I told her no. I said, \u201cIf I\u2019m grounded, then I shouldn\u2019t be trusted with babysitting either.\u201d She got really mad and said I was being selfish. She argued that watching my brother isn\u2019t a punishment, it\u2019s a responsibility, and I can\u2019t just pick and choose when to help out.\n\nI told her I feel like I\u2019m being treated like a second parent, and I\u2019m tired of always having to drop everything for her. She told me that\u2019s what family does and accused me of being ungrateful for everything she\u2019s done for me.\n\nNow she\u2019s barely talking to me, and I feel like the worst sister/daughter ever. My friends say I\u2019m not wrong for standing up for myself, but my mom thinks I\u2019m a brat. I get that she\u2019s under a lot of pressure, but I feel like I deserve to have some independence.\n\nSo, AITAH for refusing to babysit after getting grounded?",

There are grants, scholarships and other programs for low income students to go to school. Or she can hold off on college and work full time to get her feet under her. Or find a nursing home that will hire her as an aide and pay for the CNA certification. Her options are numerous but should only be considered AFTER trying to have an adult conversation with her mother.</p>\n</div>",

It wasn't right, but parents are still people and can't be perfect.

I get you think fondly of your mothers help good for you but op is pulling their weight and balancing going to school and yes I agree conversations need to happen but her mom needs to find other options than her child and she is actively holding her daughter back until she does.  I think op is grown enough for this conversation I\u2019m just not sure if her mom is she needs op and instead of thanking her she demands more and uses guilt to keep op in line. This situation works more for the mom than op so I think it\u2019s going to be difficult for the mom to loosen her grip on op.</p>\n</div>",

Essentially, because her male partner is deceased, your mom is using you to fill that role. She\u2019s become reliant on you for everything from childcare to cooking to chores. If she\u2019s also using you as an emotional crutch/therapist, then things have fully escalated into what\u2019s called \u201ccovert incest\u201d. These are both forms of abuse, and are taken quite seriously (assuming ample proof exists). \n\nWhile it\u2019s reasonable to expect some help from a child, what she\u2019s expecting of you is the functionality of another fully grown adult with a well-baked frontal lobe. That\u2019s literally not something that you are capable of providing nor should it be expected of you. While it may be difficult, you need to sit down with your mom and have a difficult conversation (as an aside, if this is her typical attitude, you need to have a guidance counselor, therapist, trusted teacher, family member, or guardian ad litem there to ensure you are heard and taken seriously). This will require opening up to that other individual prior to the conversation with your mom so that you have a supportive adult who can help guide the conversation and prevent things from becoming too emotionally charged.\n\nWhile your mom is in a really difficult position, she can\u2019t expect you to alleviate the entirety of that burden. For starters, if your dad was working, your family is entitled to survivor\u2019s benefits that may help her cover things financially so she doesn\u2019t have to work as much. Do you know if there\u2019s family on either side that could provide support? Does your family have a social worker/case worker who can help her apply and identify programs that would be able to help? \n\nAs far as the conversation itself goes, this is a basic outline: \u201cMom, I\u2019m really sorry dad is gone and I want to be here to help you in a reasonable capacity. At the moment, you\u2019re expecting me to fill his shoes entirely, and I simply can\u2019t. From cleaning, laundry, cooking, babysitting duty, and school, there\u2019s no time left for me to be a child. I know that you need help, and I will fill in where I can to help support you. Having said that, I need you to meet me halfway and acknowledge that I am also a minor. I may not be as young as my brother, but that doesn\u2019t mean you can put the burden of parenthood entirely on my shoulders. I\u2019m willing to provide babysitting (X number of hours/on these particular days of the week, etc.). I also think we should look through the chores to find a better way of assigning tasks so that I\u2019m not completely swamped constantly. For instance, having me cook and babysit three days a week after school and I will look after my own laundry. Beyond that, though, your expectations are unreasonable and are actively harmful. I\u2019m stressed, overwhelmed, and I never have the opportunity to be a kid. That may not matter to you, but I don\u2019t think this is how dad would want things to go, do you?\u201d\n\nHonestly, OP, this is technically negligence so if she refuses to meet in the middle, telling a guidance counselor or mandated reporter what you\u2019re going through should help. It\u2019s a difficult situation, but she\u2019s not the first or the last person who\u2019s been here before. She needs to find a much broader support system than her other child. You should be able to have a few hours a week that are just your own. Ask her what she plans to do in three years once you\u2019ve reached the age of majority and are no longer there to pick up the slack. Does she expect her 8 year old to raise himself or is she hoping you\u2019ll sacrifice your own future to be a live in maid and babysitter? NTA, at all. Your mom is grounding you because it\u2019s easier than fighting with your reasonable demands for free time. This way, it\u2019s all free time! Good luck, OP, and don\u2019t be afraid to find outside support to help you.",

That may not matter to you, but I don\u2019t think this is how dad would want things to go, do you?\u201d</p>\n\n<p>Honestly, OP, this is technically negligence so if she refuses to meet in the middle, telling a guidance counselor or mandated reporter what you\u2019re going through should help. It\u2019s a difficult situation, but she\u2019s not the first or the last person who\u2019s been here before. She needs to find a much broader support system than her other child. You should be able to have a few hours a week that are just your own. Ask her what she plans to do in three years once you\u2019ve reached the age of majority and are no longer there to pick up the slack. Does she expect her 8 year old to raise himself or is she hoping you\u2019ll sacrifice your own future to be a live in maid and babysitter? NTA, at all. Your mom is grounding you because it\u2019s easier than fighting with your reasonable demands for free time. This way, it\u2019s all free time! Good luck, OP, and don\u2019t be afraid to find outside support to help you.</p>\n</div>",

I did this exact thing when I was 18. A burner phone you add minutes to is very cheap at the Dollar General. Keep your device, and switch it over to a prepaid phone so it can\u2019t be shut off on you. The best thing I can advise on that is to get yourself signed up for state insurance (it\u2019s called HIP in Indiana, but will be called something different if you\u2019re elsewhere; it\u2019s like Medicaid, and is income-based); you can call your local hospital and ask for the person who helps with getting state-sponsored insurance. Then you qualify for a free phone through Q-Link, or any number of companies. It will automatically load each month, and you can pay extra for added data/minutes. \n\nIf your mother tries to pull a fast one, and leaves your brother with you without asking, or when you have to be at work, as long as you have your housing/job situation handled, you can call CPS and let them know you did not agree to babysit, and you were not asked to, that your brother was left with you without your consent, and that you can\u2019t/wont be responsible for him because you have to be at work at X time, and he cannot come with you. They\u2019ll give your mother a stern lecture about leaving her kid where and when she feels like it, and she won\u2019t get to do it again without him being removed from her care. That\u2019s the nuclear option, but if you have a place to sleep and a job, it might be the best option to show you will not be parentified, and will not be imposed on for her convenience. \n\nIt\u2019s hard to be on your own at 18, but it can definitely be done. I left 3 months before I turned 18, and I never moved back in. I\u2019m now 30+, and I have a backbone made of steel. If you need any advice or have any questions, feel free to DM me.",

The best thing I can advise on that is to get yourself signed up for state insurance (it\u2019s called HIP in Indiana, but will be called something different if you\u2019re elsewhere; it\u2019s like Medicaid, and is income-based); you can call your local hospital and ask for the person who helps with getting state-sponsored insurance. Then you qualify for a free phone through Q-Link, or any number of companies. It will automatically load each month, and you can pay extra for added data/minutes. </p>\n\n<p>If your mother tries to pull a fast one, and leaves your brother with you without asking, or when you have to be at work, as long as you have your housing/job situation handled, you can call CPS and let them know you did not agree to babysit, and you were not asked to, that your brother was left with you without your consent, and that you can\u2019t/wont be responsible for him because you have to be at work at X time, and he cannot come with you. They\u2019ll give your mother a stern lecture about leaving her kid where and when she feels like it, and she won\u2019t get to do it again without him being removed from her care. That\u2019s the nuclear option, but if you have a place to sleep and a job, it might be the best option to show you will not be parentified, and will not be imposed on for her convenience. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s hard to be on your own at 18, but it can definitely be done. I left 3 months before I turned 18, and I never moved back in. I\u2019m now 30+, and I have a backbone made of steel. If you need any advice or have any questions, feel free to DM me.</p>\n</div>",

As long as OP lives rent free at the house it&#39;s expected that she would have some obligations, even if the 5yo isn&#39;t really OPs responsibility.  It&#39;s a bad situation all around.</p>\n</div>",

Idk what you mean by forced, but most parents still consider themselves responsible for their kids until they\u2019ve graduated.

        "body": "I think there are a few factors here. The first is that you are now an adult, but you still live at home, and it sounds as if you are in your last year of high school. Your mother is using a double-standard here to get you to do what she wants. On the one hand, she can tell you what to do and ground you if you don't obey, and on the other hand, she expects you to do adult tasks like babysitting your brother, cooking, cleaning, supporting the family with money from your part-time job. And, since you have been doing this since your dad died a few years ago (i.e. before you turned 18) she has long expected you to prioritize the support of the family over your own childhood.  \n\nI think you are correct that this double-standard is inappropriate. You can't afford to move out so you can't push this probably as hard as you want to, because you need your mom to continue to give you a place to live. On the other hand, it sounds like she will continue to need you to babysit your brother and provide support to her in the house. If she kicks you out, she also loses her free babysitter, cook, dishwasher, and the money you provide for groceries. In other words, I think you may have some leeway here to set some boundaries.\n\nI think a reasonable way forward for you is to say something like: I would like to revisit what happened over the last couple of weekends. I understand that you sometimes need help with babysitting Joey so you can do the job that keeps us in the house. However, I don't appreciate you expecting me to cancel my longstanding plans at the last minute to babysit Joey for you. I am doing far more to help out than other girls my age and in general I have been doing it with a good will. I get that it's needed because dad passed away and you need the help, but you also need to understand that you're not entitled to treat me like I have the responsibilities of a husband when I'm actually your daughter, while at the same time you act like I'm a naughty and disobedient child when I'm actually an adult with my own future to build. For example, grounding me is inappropriate since I am an adult. I also find it very disrespectful of the amount of work I have been doing to help you with the care of Joey and the household. I would like if we can change some things. I will be happy to continue to cook, clean, and contribute most of the income from my part-time job towards groceries. However, I will also be saving x % of my income from now on for my own future. I can babysit Joey as long as I have Y days notice, but I am no longer willing to cancel my weekend plans with friends, and I'm not willing to babysit if I have a big test coming up, as I'll need to study. I would like you to find a babysitter other than me if you have to work on the weekends. Some of my friends like to babysit for cash and I can give you their phone numbers. I do help out with your grocery expenses so I think you'll have enough cash to hire them if it's an emergency. I love you and want us to be happy as a family but these are the things I need to happen so that I can thrive in this family.",

Older kids didn't ask to be parents before their time, nor did they ever sign up for taking up the responsibilities of a parent. If a young child wants to help with small tasks (example: handing over diapers) to feel included in their role as an older sibling, then that's one thing. Or if an older sibling volunteers to help, and is compensated one way or another for their work, like with an increased allowance (because it is work, as being a parent or babysitter isn't their role), then this is fine. But forcing your older children into a parenting role they didn't ask for and going so far as to interfere with their normal routine (like canceling their social time with friends) is crossing the line of what should be their role in the family. Ignoring your kids' feelings on such subjects (and outright punishing them for expressing them) is outright toxic behavior. I suggest you start thinking about moving out if this is the family dynamic your mom is going to continue to push without ever considering your needs or opinion.
