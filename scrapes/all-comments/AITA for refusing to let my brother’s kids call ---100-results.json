      "selftext": "so here\u2019s the deal, i (32f) lost my sister-in-law, jess (30f), about 8 months ago. she was married to my brother, tom (34m), and they had 3 kids (9f, 6m, 3m). jess was honestly like a sister to me, and losing her was heartbreaking for all of us.\n\nafter she passed, tom started struggling a lot. he\u2019s a good dad, but he\u2019s drowning with grief and trying to manage the kids. so he asked me to move in with him to \u201chelp out for a while.\u201d i agreed because i love my nieces and nephew, and i wanted to be there for them.\n\nthe issue started a couple months ago. the kids started calling me \u201cmom.\u201d at first, i thought it was a slip, but now they do it all the time. i gently told them i\u2019m their *aunt* and that their mom was special and no one could replace her. they seemed to understand, but tom got upset.\n\nhe said it was \u201cnatural\u201d for them to see me as a mom figure now and that i should just let it happen because it\u2019s \u201ccomforting\u201d for them. i told him i didn\u2019t feel comfortable being called that\u2014it feels like i\u2019m erasing jess\u2019s memory, and it\u2019s not my place.\n\nthings blew up when we were at a family dinner, and the youngest called me \u201cmommy\u201d in front of everyone. my dad looked shocked, my mom got quiet, and tom snapped at me for \u201ccorrecting\u201d the kid in front of the family. he said i embarrassed him and confused the kids.\n\nnow tom\u2019s barely speaking to me, and my mom thinks i should just let the kids call me whatever makes them feel better. but i feel like it\u2019s crossing a line. i\u2019m not their mom, and i don\u2019t want to take that title away from jess, even if she\u2019s gone.\n\nthe worst part is, the kids are starting to get upset when i remind them i\u2019m their aunt, not their mom. i feel like i\u2019m making things worse, but this whole situation is just too much for me.\n\nAITA for sticking to my boundaries here?",

First, the kids are in a world of hurt and have lost all sense of safety in the world with the loss of their mother.  They are desperate to form a connection with someone they can rely on and that\u2019s you.  The only way they know how to show that need and that love is by calling you mommy.  It\u2019s understandable. \n\nIt\u2019s also understandable that you don\u2019t feel that is appropriate.  First of all they need grief counselling.  If there is good health insurance, please set this up.  If not, start with the school counsellor for recommendations. Also many local hospices have programs for children who have experienced a loss. \n\nThe youngest kid is at the point where he might even struggle to remember his mother.  All the kids must be desperate for security.  It\u2019s ok to reject their attempts to make you mom but you must replace it with some other solution.  No to mum but yes to something else to indicate the importance of your bond.  Explain how important and solid your role is.  Let them know you are permanently in their lives.  Remind them that they had a wonderful mommy who will always be their mommy but you can be their aunty who will love them forever.  Maybe let them come up with a special title for you that isn\u2019t mom but maybe feels more personal to all of you.  \n\nNever mind what everyone else thinks.  You and the kids are what matter here.  What would Jess want?",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>NTA.  I don\u2019t want to think about how the kids would explain that their dad and \u201cmom\u201d are siblings\u2026</p>\n\n<p>I think there are two issues here.  First, the kids are in a world of hurt and have lost all sense of safety in the world with the loss of their mother.  They are desperate to form a connection with someone they can rely on and that\u2019s you.  The only way they know how to show that need and that love is by calling you mommy.  It\u2019s understandable. </p>\n\n<p>It\u2019s also understandable that you don\u2019t feel that is appropriate.  First of all they need grief counselling.  If there is good health insurance, please set this up.  If not, start with the school counsellor for recommendations. Also many local hospices have programs for children who have experienced a loss. </p>\n\n<p>The youngest kid is at the point where he might even struggle to remember his mother.  All the kids must be desperate for security.  It\u2019s ok to reject their attempts to make you mom but you must replace it with some other solution.  No to mum but yes to something else to indicate the importance of your bond.  Explain how important and solid your role is.  Let them know you are permanently in their lives.  Remind them that they had a wonderful mommy who will always be their mommy but you can be their aunty who will love them forever.  Maybe let them come up with a special title for you that isn\u2019t mom but maybe feels more personal to all of you.  </p>\n\n<p>Never mind what everyone else thinks.  You and the kids are what matter here.  What would Jess want?</p>\n</div>",
