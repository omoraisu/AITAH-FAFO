      "selftext": "So I (f21) have three older sisters let's call them Kay (f27). Sam (f26). And Nat (f25). This is about Kay and Sam. So it's Kay's first born son's 7th birthday party today. And it's at her house. I get there around 230pm since I had things I had to do today. And Sam shows up around 3pm with her boyfriend of 4 years. Kay has a boyfriend of 2 years and he was an alcoholic so Kay doesn't really like him around alcohol and either does Josh. Well Sam decided to bring alcohol to my nephews birthday party. Which honestly is stupid since there was a bunch of kids and I think adults shouldn't drink while around a bunch of kids. One of Kay's house rules were no alcohol. I'm 21 and I barley even drink so that's a no problem for me. Well Sam decided to go against Kay's rules and bring alcohol. \n\nWell Kay asked her to take it Sam\"s house which is literally right next door. And Sam and her boyfriend both refuse to go \"all the way over to their house when they can drink it here\" I yelled at Sam and told her she needs to start respecting everyone's boundaries if she expects us to respect her boundaries. Sam got mad at me for calling her out but eventually they just put the alcohol outside the back door. And we got over it. Well I'm the talkative sister. I don't really like silence cause of my childhood so I normally do most of the talking expect today. I was really upset at Sam ngl. She noticed that I talked to my other two sisters and their kids plus Sam's kids aswell but didn't really talk to her. If she asked me a question I'll of course answer but I didn't go out of my way to have a conversation with her like I normally do. This got my sister a little upset. \ud83d\ude22 \n\nBefore she left she asked me why I barley talked to her and I just told her I need some space from her and her boyfriend she asked me why and I told her the truth that I love her but I'm very upset at the fact that you know Kay's boyfriend is an alcoholic and can't really be around alcohol and she told me she just wanted to see if he was tempted to drink it. We were outside talking and I might have raised my voice and said it wasn't her decision to do that. And that's when she told me she doesn't like Kay's boyfriend I then went off on her and I said I don't exactly like your boyfriend but you don't see me going around and tempting him with something he was addicted to. And that your boyfriend left not even a month ago and left his child before you made a threat that you would get full custody if he doesn't come back. And that Kay's boyfriend not once left her side or cheated on her and actually helps raises her other 3 kids that isn't exactly his by blood and that Kay's boyfriend is a better MAN then yours and she left upset and I told her to not contact me for a while. Kay and her boyfriend and Nat and her baby daddy are on my side but Sam and her boyfriend are calling me an asshole. \nSo am I an asshole for calling out my sisters lack of respect for her sisters boundaries?
