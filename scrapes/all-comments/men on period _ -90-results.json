      "selftext": "Need advice from older adults \n\nforgive me for the long story \n\nI had a best friend of 8 years . We met in 2018 and have been doing so much shit together. Went to weddings , funerals and , graduated high school together and even worked together . He was jobless at the time and I helped him get into the company I was in . This happened atleast twice when the first job closed down. \n\nRecently a couple of months ago he got a good job , that pays quite well . When he got his job , I lost mine and I\u2019ve been unemployed until now. Ever since then , he became proud . Paying for shit for the both of us and always bringing it up during conversations .Ive never asked to be paid for but he always insisted . He even paid for our road trip twice now \n\nBut yesterday , we had a huge fallout . He borrowed something of mine 2 days ago and promised to return to me the next day because he was sending me for my interview anyway ( my car broke down ) . The day came and he never got back to me  , we were late because I was waiting for him and he never showed up , nor did he even bother to text me at all . I called him , within 3 seconds he declined my call and after a while , told me he just woke up . Which doesn\u2019t make sense because he declined my call within seconds. He has a history of doing this btw , especially during important events . Cold feet or bailing at the very last minute . \n\nI told him that he put me in a difficult spot and he still got my item to return . Then he got mad and told me I\u2019m being calculative . He told me how he spent so much on me and how I\u2019m counting small stuff like this . \n\nI told him it\u2019s not about my item not being returned , it\u2019s because he didn\u2019t honor his word and clearly didn\u2019t take me seriously. The dude then got defensive and told me that he doesn\u2019t understand how am I so stressed out when I\u2019m jobless , and useless . He said how I lied about being abused as a child because he saw me as a fatass and didn\u2019t believe me . Claiming I made shit up all this time . For 8 years I\u2019ve been telling him my story on abuse and he threw it all in my face in 1 day . \n\nHe then said some really hurtful stuff and when I said he doesn\u2019t actually mean that and he better think wisely before he speak, he threatened to bring buddies of his over to my place to **** me up . He then took my laptop , and my clothes that he borrowed for weeks now , wrapped them up , and threw them out his balcony into bushes nearby and told me to find it . It was raining heavily at the time . I was willing to overlook the stuffs that he said to me but by throwing my shit out and making me search for it in the night like a dog under the rain , that was a different kind of betrayal . Idk if it\u2019s forgivable , I mean who even does that ? \n\nI don\u2019t know what to feel tbh . I\u2019m more than heartbroken but at the same time relieved ? Because I felt like I\u2019m being held hostage by him throughout these couple of months because of how he pays for shit and then brings it up , making me feel that I owe him . \n\nIs the friendship recoverable ? I can\u2019t accept the fact that this is it . Even though he threatened me like I was nothing to him , he meant a lot to me . ",
