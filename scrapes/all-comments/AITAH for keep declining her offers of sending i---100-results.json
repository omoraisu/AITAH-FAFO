      "selftext": "Hi Reddit! Few months ago, my gf wanted to share me meals of my choice on weekly basis. I used to deliver her cookies, cakes, and all the bakery item I knew she loves; however, she wanted to send me back some of my fav foods too. During those months, I was interning at my school and coming back home late followed my high school senior year exams right after my final few days as intern. I was helluva packed. With my busy schedule primarily due to academics, I kept decling her whenever she wanted to parcel me meals. Now I feel like I might've broken her heart, although she's all cool. I shouldn't decline to her or even my parents whenever they want to show their love towards me in terms of sending in meals. I feel like I need to be more open towards accepting gifts, especially food,  whenever someone wants to share with me out of love. ",
