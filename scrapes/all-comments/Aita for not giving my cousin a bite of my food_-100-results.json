      "selftext": "I 13 m my cousin 9 m and my uncle 55 m,\nFor some background \nMy cousin can't eat to much since he has had a lot of problems and is in the verge of diabetes but in may his parents divorced, \nAnd sice then they can't say no to him.\nMe my cousin my uncle my grandma and some other family members Went  to an amusement park in my city,\nBut the problem started when when went to eat my cousin decided on some pupusas (latin American food) and I wanted Korean corn dogs so my grandma gave me money to buy one  and when my food came my cousin had already eaten. but I put mustard and Cajun dressing in my corn dog (both things he does like) but he asked me for a bite but I knew he wouldn't like it and he'd take a really big bite so I said \"  you already ate so I won't\". but he and my grandma insisted but after a minute they calmed down but I decided I wanted soda so I told my grandma \"if you give me  a coke I'll give my cousin a bite\".\nBut instead of her responding my uncle said\n\"No don't since you already showed him we really to rethink inviting you anywhere. You couldn't even give him a bite but we take you out to McDonald's each week (which is a lie since the last time I went with him was a month ago and I was sick so I didn't even eat\nAnd when I got the green light from my mom he got offended and refused to buy me anything) .\" So I kept quiet the rest of the evening but this isn't even the first time this has happened when he bad mouthed me just for wanting something. So I don't know what to do.",
