      "selftext": "Strap in cause this one's gonna be a doozie, but here we go. I (25M) have known Angelie (25F) for a bit over 6 years, and we've been friends for most of this time. We met at college, and for a quick context, our friendship was one of those where we instantly clicked and it turned out we both had a crush on each other, but were too damn shy to tell the other and we drifted apart, so much so that we didn't talk for over a year afterwards, even though we still had classes together.\n\nFast forward to a year after that, and I had already gotten into a relationship, and for school reasons I had to text her for a group work. We started catching up and among other things, we talked about the elephant in the room, and things quickly turned sour and bitter, cause she revealed to me the fact that she had a crush on me, and vice versa, and it didn't end up well (I got blocked and didn't talk for YET another year).\n\nBy this point, during the pandemic, in 2021, after a whole year without talking, she texted me, and again we caught up, and finally stablished a somewhat functioning friendship. But she asked me on the condition that we'd be \"online friends\". In this time, mostly through text, there have been times when she has shown concern over me, or thrown in advice, texted first (which is not the norm but sometimes happens), asked me for a handful of IRL favors, and a couple times even felt a little flirty towards me.\n\nMy problem comes when, three years after that, after things have normalized and we've been back to campus, I feel she acts weird towards me, cause we often talk through text, but I can count in one hand the irl interactions we've had, she's soon to graduate, and I feel like shit, not only cause she ignores me when literally walking by me, but because she got ahead and will graduate before me, and I have often felt I'm not worthy of her since I got ser back so much, like, we're leagues apart.\n\nI've wanted to talk to her but as of late she's also distant through text messages, and I can't help but feel like I am the problem, so, what can I do in this situation?\n\nSo, WIBTAH if I decided to go up and talk to her? What should I do?\n\nTL;DR: WIBTAH if I confronted my friend, who I've got history with, over her only acknowledging me through text but not in person?",
