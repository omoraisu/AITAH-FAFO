      "selftext": "I (16m) have a younger sister (14f). Our parents always treated us differently because I'm a boy and she's a girl. They really don't want her to ever be disappointed and they'd always ask me to skip stuff or give up something so she could do something else or have something else.\n\nExamples of that. If we both got invited to birthday parties on the same day they'd ask me to skip it so she could go to the other, instead of just dropping us off at the different parties. If it was my turn to pick where we ate for dinner and I wanted my favorite, and she complained, they'd ask me to let her pick, even though I didn't like her favorite either. But she was younger and a girl so they thought it was okay. If we went on vacation or to the amusement park close to our town, they'd ask if I minded going last so she could go on rides or do what she wanted to do, and then they'd just never get around to mine. Then if I was given candy or something and she liked it, I'd be asked to give it to her. I did say no sometimes but I was either told I was an older sibling and should or they ignored my no and did what they wanted to anyawy.\n\nBecause of this my sister expected this and she became so spoiled. It only got worse when I started babysitting two years ago and making money. I was asked to buy her something she wanted or to give her some money. And of course saying no was a waste of time again.\n\nMy sister needs braces now. She doesn't want the regular ones. I was told she's not getting Invisalign either but there's some special braces she won't mind wearing but they cost a lot. She complained when our parents said they didn't have the money and she complained so hard that she even said they shouldn't give me anything for Christmas this year to afford it. So of course my parents asked me if I was okay with not getting a gift this year so she could have those braces. I started to say no and they started talking over me so I said you basically fuck you and do what you want because I don't count. My sister was trying to say something about it and I pointed right at her face and told her to stop fucking talking to me. I called her a spoiled and selfish brat and I said I don't want her to be my sister, I said I'm older but it doesn't mean she should always come first. She argued back at first and I told her to fucking stay away from me and she can fuck off with our parents. I was mad.\n\nMy parents tried to yell at me that same night but I was so mad they stopped. But the next day they told me snapping at my sister was wrong and I shouldn't say yes if I mean no. So I said no and they said saying no doesn't work. I told them to fuck off. They took my stuff for over a week for talking to them like that and they lectured me again for taking it out on my sister.\n\nAITA?",

You're not responsible for your sister's growth; especially not as she keeps taking advantage of you. You don't need to engage with the bad advice or take it seriously. They're spouting nonsense. \n\nI was stuck with my abusive family for longer than I wanted to be, but I got on my feet and cut them out in 2015. I've never reconsidered; my life has been much better without them in it. If I got news that they died, I'd feel relieved. \n\nThe only disruption is when people like ssuuh feel entitled to tell me that I should care for family and \"will regret it when they're gone.\" Generally, I just assume they're the abuser in their family, and are afraid that their behavior will come back to bite them eventually. It's the only reasonable explanation for having such an entitled and tone-deaf position. \n\nYou'll likely run into people like that offline, too--set boundaries when you can, distance yourself from them when you can't. They're not worth the frustration, or the drama they're trying to cause. \n\nIt sounds like you have a decent plan in place. Here's where I struggled: I entered the job market without experience after college. It was right into the recession, so I was competing with people who had 10+ years of experience for entry level roles. \n\nYou've got some time to build experience now. Consider what you'd like to do as a career, and see if you can get a part time job or internship doing it now. You'd be surprised what kind of opportunities a company can make \"appear\" out of nowhere for a high school student who's interested in their field. \n\nA guidance counselor at your school may even be able to seek out something like that for you--if not as far as an internship, they may be able to arrange \"job shadowing\". That'll give you a chance to make some personal connections by \"hanging out\" in a workplace for a day or two. \n\nAt your age, you may be able to just walk in and ask--a strategy that definitely won't work after high school. You may find more traction if you build a LinkedIn profile, connect with people at companies that interest you, and ask what they did to get into their field. You may get the occasional surprise invite to check out their workplace, and get good advice. \n\nIt's going to be challenging to have an apartment, even with friends, on babysitting and retail wages. And it'll make it harder to pivot to a better paying career later. Just doing something else part time now, can help you find something better paying later. Both from the experience you'll gain, and the connections you'll make. \n\nAs others said, also make sure you're hiding your money. If your parents know you're planning to leave, they'll have an interest in taking as much from you as they can. You'll need to save enough for a security deposit and 1-2 months rent. You'll also need to demonstrate that you have a steady income. You should work with your friends to ensure they're all ready to do the same. \n\nI also want to point out something important you might not know: if you have grandparents, aunts, uncles, and other extended family in your life, they might know that things are bad. I found out years after I got out of there, that my aunts and uncles knew about the abuse--one, I didn't even realize, had offered to adopt me. They're likely not saying anything to you because they don't want your parents to revoke access; and some people react defensively when confronted with abuse, so they don't want to push you away as well. \n\nIt's great that one of your friend's parents is able to help. But if you can find assistance within your extended family, it may help the next couple years go a bit more smoothly for you. Be careful how much you divulge about your exit plan!",

That they will no longer have to be upset they can\u2019t completely ignore you and give their golden child without acting like you would ever be getting anything. That they no longer need to act like they are supposed to love and care for you instead of golden Child being their only child they want. That as soon as you are legally allowed to move out at 18 you will never see them again. That your telling them now so they don\u2019t act like they have no idea who the failed you your whole life nor why you left. \n\n  \nSet up a bank account your parents can\u2019t get access to and keep all paperwork and passwords secret. If your in US and you need them then buy a safe or look into the costs of hiring a safety deposit box somewhere. Then make sure all your wages and documents are stored out of the house and safely away from them. Go looking when your parents are out for your birth certificate and ssn number and remove them without them knowing. They are legally yours anyway and as soon as you\u2019re an adult it\u2019s illegal for them to withhold them from you. However many abusive parents try to withhold them to stop their kids leaving and to make things difficult. That they might decide at some point that theh want you to pay rent or give sister some of your wages. That they\u2019d rather you stay so she can keep getting the rent money or your wages they try and demand from you. So make sure your wages never go into a joint account with your parents. That you have it safe in a different bank account or safety deposit box just somewhere it\u2019s safe. Just so they can\u2019t try and stop you later. \n\nSorry these are the parents you were born with and although you love them take it from someone who grew up exactly like this, they will never change. Even later in life they kept giving my siblings thousands especially golden child. I wouldn\u2019t say anything but was told by them they were just getting their inheritance early. They hadn\u2019t even asked for it but apparently that\u2019s what they were getting given year after year. No surprise when my parents passed my share of the inheritance had long been spent on golden child. Both my older siblings got their share over the years but of course golden child was then given mine when they had no more to give but wanted to.   \n  \nThey also tried to stop me moving out at 18 and then tried to insist I continue paying rent and keep when I no longer would be living there. At no point was my siblings charged rent or keep but i was forced to get a job to provide for myself as they only gave my siblings and not me. Then forced to give them 50 % of the little I could earn and they hid my adult siblings never once had to pay them.  When I left they lost their free maid and my income and they did not like that at all. Of course I told them no and moved hours away deliberately but they still did crap to try and force me back with them. It didn\u2019t matter I was unwanted and seen as a burden for existing, it didn\u2019t matter my gc sister always got my presents as well because she\u2019s throw a fit. When time came they decided they liked my money and free labour of doing all the household chores. Were I thought they\u2019d celebrate I was gone. So please be careful and take measures. Save every penny you can to use to get out as soon as possible.",

That they no longer need to act like they are supposed to love and care for you instead of golden Child being their only child they want. That as soon as you are legally allowed to move out at 18 you will never see them again. That your telling them now so they don\u2019t act like they have no idea who the failed you your whole life nor why you left. </p>\n\n<p>Set up a bank account your parents can\u2019t get access to and keep all paperwork and passwords secret. If your in US and you need them then buy a safe or look into the costs of hiring a safety deposit box somewhere. Then make sure all your wages and documents are stored out of the house and safely away from them. Go looking when your parents are out for your birth certificate and ssn number and remove them without them knowing. They are legally yours anyway and as soon as you\u2019re an adult it\u2019s illegal for them to withhold them from you. However many abusive parents try to withhold them to stop their kids leaving and to make things difficult. That they might decide at some point that theh want you to pay rent or give sister some of your wages. That they\u2019d rather you stay so she can keep getting the rent money or your wages they try and demand from you. So make sure your wages never go into a joint account with your parents. That you have it safe in a different bank account or safety deposit box just somewhere it\u2019s safe. Just so they can\u2019t try and stop you later. </p>\n\n<p>Sorry these are the parents you were born with and although you love them take it from someone who grew up exactly like this, they will never change. Even later in life they kept giving my siblings thousands especially golden child. I wouldn\u2019t say anything but was told by them they were just getting their inheritance early. They hadn\u2019t even asked for it but apparently that\u2019s what they were getting given year after year. No surprise when my parents passed my share of the inheritance had long been spent on golden child. Both my older siblings got their share over the years but of course golden child was then given mine when they had no more to give but wanted to.   </p>\n\n<p>They also tried to stop me moving out at 18 and then tried to insist I continue paying rent and keep when I no longer would be living there. At no point was my siblings charged rent or keep but i was forced to get a job to provide for myself as they only gave my siblings and not me. Then forced to give them 50 % of the little I could earn and they hid my adult siblings never once had to pay them.  When I left they lost their free maid and my income and they did not like that at all. Of course I told them no and moved hours away deliberately but they still did crap to try and force me back with them. It didn\u2019t matter I was unwanted and seen as a burden for existing, it didn\u2019t matter my gc sister always got my presents as well because she\u2019s throw a fit. When time came they decided they liked my money and free labour of doing all the household chores. Were I thought they\u2019d celebrate I was gone. So please be careful and take measures. Save every penny you can to use to get out as soon as possible.</p>\n</div>",

You\u2019re not her parents, you\u2019re her enablers. Merry. Christmas.\u201d\n\nOP, your parents are awful, and you shouldn\u2019t have to fight for a crumb of decency while her every whim is indulged. First, find someone over 18 that you can trust to help you open a bank account and start depositing your checks there. At your house, get together your birth certificate, social security card, passport, etc. and keep them in a safe place only you have access to. This is just as important as money. It took me three years to establish my identity after I bailed because my parent locked them in a safe. This way at least you have some money they can\u2019t touch and a way to work/get a license/rent an apartment, etc. If you work really hard in school, you may be able to get scholarships to lessen the burden of student loans. Alternatively, if you\u2019re looking into the trades, that\u2019s a great route, as well. I personally regret not getting into electrical work, myself.

Any time you are doing work for money, tell them it\u2019s related to either school or study group or book club. Set up a bank account (not sure if you have any trustworthy extended family) and if you need to ask an adult to go with you, come clean with the set of friend\u2019s parents you are closest with about what\u2019s happening and tell them you need to start a bank account to begin saving to move out as soon as you turn 18 because this is (and tell them this) destroying your mental health and you have to plan to remove yourself from the toxicity as soon as you are of legal age. \n\nTell them you can\u2019t trust having money in the house because your parents will take it for your sister, and tell them your parents have flat out told you that even if you say no it doesn\u2019t matter and they will take from you regardless. Tell them this crosses your boundaries, it is YOUR money that YOU worked for, and you need support in learning how to manage your money responsibly, Ask if they\u2019d be willing to help yo learn how to do that. \n\nIt sounds like you have some solid friends and that their parents care about you, so that\u2019s a really good thing. You absolutely can do this; it\u2019s normal to feel angry when our boundaries are crossed repeatedly. Start learning about healthy coping skills, like breath work, directing your thoughts to help calm yourself so that at times when they or your sister is on their bullshit, you can learn how to stay calm so they can\u2019t give you hell for snapping. Physical activity can be really amazing to help manage anger and stress; learning yoga and practicing that actually helped me get through some of the worst years of my life when I was between the ages of 17-25, and I still use what I learned from yoga to this day. You need something in your life that helps bring you peace and also helps your body I\u2019ve the emotional energy so it doesn\u2019t bottle up or cause health problems for you later.\n\nI developed some pretty intense mental health issues and physical chronic health problems after I hit my 20s after going through a lot of trauma from a young age right through my young adult life. Please take care of yourself OP; it sucks that you have to parent yourself at the age you are at, but learning to do so with love for yourself will save you from becoming self destructive or developing big issues after you do finally get out of this situation.\n\nYou deserve care. Your feelings are valid, and also sometimes we are the only ones who can give ourselves the care we need most. It shouldn\u2019t be like that, but sometimes it is, and if you can get a handle on caring well for yourself and your health now, you\u2019ll be that much more prepared to manage the day to day stresses and life stress that comes with becoming a full on adult. \n\nYou\u2019re in my prayers, kiddo, and I want you to know I 110% believe you can and will get through this and when shot gets hard, remind yourself that there are hundreds of strangers out there in the world who are rooting for you and that it won\u2019t be like it is right now forever \ud83e\udd0d\n\nSorry for the long comment, but I really hope that last paragraph sticks for ya, bud.",

If you can trust your friend's parents, ask them to help you set up your own bank account (in a bank separate from the one your parents use).  If your parents are used to taking money you earn, start by putting half in the box and taking half home.  Tell them your hours got cut, or whatever.  Then gradually reduce the amount you take home and save more and more.  Alternately, quit the job your parents know about and find a different job somewhere else - but don't tell your parents.\n\nFind out where all of your important documents are stored in your parent's house (snoop while cleaning/ doing chores/ while they aren't home if you have to).  You will need your birth certificate and social security documents when you leave.\n\nDo not tell your parents that you are leaving, but start moving important items, documents and clothing out of the house starting at 17.  Hopefully your trusted friend will allow you to store a couple of boxes at their place.  Just take one item at a time tucked into your backpack or with your school things.  If you have any items that have meaning to you, \\*take them first\\*.  Leave your documents until about 4-6 weeks before your 18th birthday - just check on them periodically so they don't \"disappear\"  (Your parents might realize that you are leaving if the vanish).  If your parents do try to hide them, find them and relocate them out of the house ASAP.  \n\nImagine that your parents and sister are nothing more than stones when they get on your case.  This is difficult as they know which buttons to push.  You don't need to respond to anything stones say or do.  Minimize your reactions as best you can.  Your sister will certainly get worse for a while because she \\*needs\\* your reactions to feel good about herself, but if you continue to be bland then she'll eventually get bored and find some other target.  Thinking of her as some pitiful but revolting creature might help.  The same applies to your parents.\n\nSpend as much time out of the house as possible.  Stay late at school, join a club, pick up extra hours at work, visit friends, go for long walks.  When asked where you were just say, \"Out.\"  If they insist on knowing, remain bland.  \"I was at the library/ visiting my friend/ going for a walk/ whatever\".  Give them the bare minimum information at all times so they can't use it as ammunition against you.\n\nSix months before your 18th birthday start looking for a place to live.  If your trusted friend's parents have a guest room offer to pay rent just until you graduate High School.  Find a roommate situate or an extended stay hotel or a single room you can share with a couple of other friends that also want to escape.  Doing it 6 months in advance gives you time to find the best deal and consider your options.  Know what your budget will be before you move out.  Consider moving somewhere with more opportunities - or at least somewhere your family won't think to look for you.\n\nThen on your 18th birthday, just leave.  Walk out of the house with one box at most, preferably when your parents aren't there or even when they are sleeping (okay, two or three boxes if they 100% aren't going to catch you).  All of your important stuff will have already been moved out already, so it should be fast and easy.  Do not say goodbye in person.  If you absolutely have to tell your parents off, leave a letter on your bed.\n\nDo NOT take anything that belongs to your parents or that they could claim belongs to them.  If you have something valuable, document that it was a gift/ keep the receipt/ note that it was inherited.  If your parents pay for your cellphone, leave it behind - you can always get a pre-paid one and you don't want to talk to them anyway.\n\nStart thinking long term NOW.  If you get good grades and have a chance at getting scholarships, then consider going to college - it is expensive, but a STEM career (science, engineering, technology, medicine) is worth the investment.  Even a two year degree can get a you good job as a draftsman or nurses aide, which can then pay for a four year degree.  If your grades aren't great, consider entering a trade.  Talk to your guidance counselor about making connections to get the appropriate apprenticeships (for-profit trade schools are often a rip-off).  If you know or are related to someone in a trade, talk to them about entering it.  Offer to \"shadow\" them while they work (after school or on weekends, obviously), which means handing them tools, etc. for no pay other than a recommendation to their guild/ union.\n\nIf your parents want to know what your future plans are - lie.  Tell them you are thinking of a different major in college, (especially if you are going to trade school).  Tell them you haven't decided.  Tell them you are planning on joining a circus, or a band, or driving to Hollywood to become a porn star.  What they don't know can't hurt you.\n\nRealize that things will be super difficult for the first few years, but then they will get better.  You will have your own money, your own place, your own life - and no toxic people to mess those things up.  The hard work you put into your life in the beginning will pay off in ten or so years.  Forget your toxic parents and your selfish sister - they deserve each other. \n\nIf you are still tied up by your family's toxic attitudes in five years, consider getting some therapy to work through it - you don't want to be like them in the future.  Don't try to look to see how your parents/ sister's life is going (which will be tempting) - remember, they are just stones that you can put down and walk away from.\n\nLiving well really is its own reward. \n\nI (and a whole bunch of internet strangers) wish you the very best!",

What they don&#39;t know can&#39;t hurt you.</p>\n\n<p>Realize that things will be super difficult for the first few years, but then they will get better.  You will have your own money, your own place, your own life - and no toxic people to mess those things up.  The hard work you put into your life in the beginning will pay off in ten or so years.  Forget your toxic parents and your selfish sister - they deserve each other. </p>\n\n<p>If you are still tied up by your family&#39;s toxic attitudes in five years, consider getting some therapy to work through it - you don&#39;t want to be like them in the future.  Don&#39;t try to look to see how your parents/ sister&#39;s life is going (which will be tempting) - remember, they are just stones that you can put down and walk away from.</p>\n\n<p>Living well really is its own reward. </p>\n\n<p>I (and a whole bunch of internet strangers) wish you the very best!</p>\n</div>",

Even claiming using it to help pay for the child's rent or food which they are providing. It would be very hard to prove otherwise and costly.

But if I can&#39;t have that, I would rather have no parents than ones constantly reminding me that I don&#39;t matter.  </p>\n\n<p>In two years, you won&#39;t even have to pretend to care, I will be move on, and you can openly give my sister her way every time, rather than pretending like I matter, and then giving her everything anyways&#39;.</p>\n\n<p>Then start making plans for cutting ties at 18.  It will be tough, but it is better than constantly trying to get recognition or consideration you will never get.</p>\n</div>",

Write everything out as objectively as you can so you have something you can share when/if you need to instead of trying explain on the spot. Being family is not a right, it is a privilege.  Love is an action word, love is shown through actions. Their actions show no love, so they aren&#39;t earning the privilege of being family.</p>\n</div>",
