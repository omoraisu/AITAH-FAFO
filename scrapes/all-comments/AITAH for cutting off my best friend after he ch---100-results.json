      "selftext": "A couple of years ago, I lost a friendship with my best friend over something that still makes me shake my head. During COVID, he reached out to me about a \u201cbusiness opportunity\u201d but wouldn\u2019t tell me what it was until we had a virtual meeting. When the time came, I felt ambushed, he and his wife were there, plus another couple I didn\u2019t know, and the husband from that couple ran the whole thing. Turns out, it was Amway.\n\nI told him straight up that I didn\u2019t want any part of the business, but I\u2019d support him and his family by buying some products. I bought a few soaps\u2014good soaps, by the way\u2014but that was it.\n\nFast forward to my wedding: I asked him to be my best man because he was my best friend, and I was his best man when he got married. He said yes at first but later backed out because an Amway conference was the same weekend as my wedding. I told him, \u201cHey, do what\u2019s best for you and your family.\u201d But honestly, it hurt.\n\nI don\u2019t have any hard feelings toward him, but it\u2019s wild how quickly priorities and friendships can change.\n\nHere\u2019s the kicker, though. A few weeks ago, another friend from the same group hit me up about \u201cfinancial stuff.\u201d It gave me flashbacks. Turns out, he was trying to sell me life insurance. Then, just last night, yet another friend from that group called to tell me about his wedding. We had a good conversation, but then he ended it by telling me he sells different products now. I asked him to send the info over, and guess what? It was Amway.\n\nI don\u2019t know what\u2019s up with these predatory business practices tearing apart friendships, but it feels like these companies are encouraging people to deceive the people in their lives. AITA for distancing myself from these friends?\n",
