      "selftext": "Well I (23F) and my friend let\u2019s say Emma (20F) were friends since 8-9 years ago, we were really close and we would tell each other everything, we would hangout everyday, solve each others problems together etc. So since she started dating, she would always fuck up with them and get heart broken because she liked \u201cbad boys\u201d.  She started dating someone before 2 years and she thought they would have a happy ever after relationship until the guy started abusing her verbally and kicking her out the house when he got bored of her. After they broke up, she started speaking to the current guy, they started dating by secret so the ex doesn\u2019t find out (they started dating after 2 months \ud83d\ude02) and they are still together even now. Now that\u2019s not the problem.. the problem is she pushed everyone including me and her mom for this guy, moved with him and she would only call me when she needed something or when she was home alone (cause he works and she doesn\u2019t) and whenever we disagree about something or even fight over something, she wouldn\u2019t try to make up with me and always runs to her boyfriend. So when I started noticing, I too have a long relationship, I told my boyfriend, and he told me that it\u2019s not normal to always run to your boyfriend and not make up with your friends or even stop talking to them suddenly. That\u2019s when I realised that she doesn\u2019t see me as a friend, just as a person she hangs out when she\u2019s alone. Because we stopped doing things together like before, when she visits me at home, she stays like 30 mins or 1h and then leaves cause her boyfriend is coming home, and I\u2019m always at the bottom of the list. I hated these type of girls that once hooked up with a guy, they forget their friends. So AITAH for stopping talking to her?",
