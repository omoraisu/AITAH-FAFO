      "selftext": "I'm the eldest of 3, but also the step-child/half-sibling. Growing up I spent most of the time at my moms, and every other weekend with my dad, step mom, and siblings. There was a lot of abuse at my dad's house, and I felt like the target a lot of the time, but the extended family like my step moms parents, aunts, uncles, etc. always treated me like one of their own.\n\nI was the first to have kids, and everyone showered them with love and affection as they often do with the first-born grandchildren, but when my niece was born (brother's daughter) there was a huge shift. Suddenly nobody in the family could visit me, they were all too busy or too far... though nobody's living situation had changed, and some of them had actually moved closer to my step mom and siblings, and by proxy, me (I'm in the city, they're all a little further north). I haven't seen most of the family since the baby shower for my niece over 2 and a half years ago, and anyone I have seen it's because I have reached out to them and made the 2+ hour drive. Needless to say, it's a little bit upsetting. People that used to visit constantly and be actively involved in mine and my children's lives seemingly vanished.\n\nA couple months ago my step mother's mom (or \"nana\") called me while I was at work, and then texted me and asked me to have my kids FaceTime her. I told her I was working and asked if everything was okay, at which point she said she wanted to ask them if they wanted to go away for the weekend. Now, maybe I'm crazy, but I think at 7 and 9 years old their mom should maybe be asked first, before a relative they hardly see invites them on a weekend away. I told her I didn't like how she approached it, and that I would like to be involved in planning of such things. I also reminded her that my children deserve consistency from the people in their lives, and simply dropping in once a year to take them on a fancy trip was not acceptable in my eyes. Again, maybe that's just me. I asked her to please look at things from my side, and stop discrediting me as their mother, or else remove herself... she chose the latter and blocked me. She then proceeded to visit with my children without my knowledge when they were spending the weekend with my step mom, which I knew was a possibility but having it confirmed left a sour taste with regards to my step mom (who also gave them an energy drink, knowing both children had/have heart issues, and when I voiced my displeasure she told them that I was angry but it \"didn't matter\"). After months of stewing, I finally reached out to my step mom and said she would only be seeing the boys under my supervision moving forward, and was immediately accused of emotional blackmail. Mind you, this isn't *just* because they're all inconsistent figures in my children's lives and constantly undermine my authority \u2014 it's because after years of being treated terribly in comparison to my flesh and blood siblings, I don't feel like possibly subjecting my children to the same behaviour, and the fact that they're all not only flakey but disrespectful to me as their mother says that, in my eyes, the possibility of my children experiencing the same mistreatment is far too real. How can I expect them to respect my children when they've never done that for me? And isn't part of respecting my children respecting their mother? Also note: I'm a single mom, so discrediting their only parental figure like that could, in some extremes, prove detrimental.\n\nSo, AITAH if I cut these people off entirely?",

One distinct memory I have involves a physical altercation between me and my step mom when I was around 13 or 14, and my dad sitting in the corner like some sort of fan at a wrestling match saying \"knock her out (insert step moms name here), just knock her out!\" I wish I could elaborate, but trauma does things... Another instance involves my dad sticking his finger down the back of my pants when I was about 14 because I had \"plumbers butt\", and instead of vocalizing it like a normal person would he felt violating me was the solution. My mom wound up getting me that day, but everyone downplayed the situation for years, and even now the only one that's agreed it wasn't okay is my mom. And at one point a few years ago one of my cousins said I deserved to be raped by my kids father, and when I called him out my nana rushed to his defense.. those are just a couple examples of what my childhood and early adulthood was like. Any time I have spoken out about anything that's happened I've been either guilt tripped, or gaslit, or both, but invalidation runs rampant regardless of the tactics used.
