      "selftext": "For context I (14F) have an atrocious singing voice and my grandfather wants me and my two other sisters (both 16F) to sing a holy shloka at my family reunion this winter. My sisters, although not gifted musicians, can sing fairly well. My grandfather is an extremely religious and spiritual hindu and for the past year I\u2019ve honestly kept my atheism a secret from him. My parents know about my beliefs and so do a few aunts and uncles and my sisters.\nA few days ago my dad told my sisters and I had to sing at the reunion, I didn\u2019t think much of it because I thought he was joking because he knows i hate singing and also praising the lord in song just goes against my beliefs. Later I got added to a family group containing my mother, my aunt and uncle and my sisters with links to the three shlokas we had to sing. I made it very clear to my mother that I didn\u2019t want to this because again I \nA) hate my singing \nB) am an atheist \nShe basically just told me to suck it up and sing because it wasn\u2019t a competition and no one was judging me on my talent. My dad was little to no help and just told me the same thing in a nicer way. The family group has just become a nuisance on my phone now constantly pinging with random messages asking us to practice with a few passive aggressive mentions directed towards me. My sisters just decided it wasn\u2019t worth the hassle to argue but idk if I\u2019m just petty af for putting up a fight or making things difficult for my mother. I love my grandfather but am I really ruining a family reunion because I don\u2019t want to perform on my week off school? I respect my family\u2019s beliefs and faith and I\u2019ve never once shoved my atheism down their throats but I just feel like my personal belief is being disregarded or sometimes just blatantly ignored for the sake of keeping the older generation happy. I still haven\u2019t practiced my shloka and maybe im just petty and selfish and even if i do sing i don\u2019t plan on making rehearsals easy for my mother.\n\nTL;DR: Im being forced to sing religious songs at my family reunion as a tone deaf atheist and I plan on being extremely petty about it.",

It\u2019s not petty to feel uncomfortable being forced into something that goes against your personal beliefs, especially at a family gathering where your participation should be about enjoying time together, not performing under pressure.\n\nYour family might see this as just a simple gesture to make your grandfather happy, but it\u2019s also fair for you to feel like your beliefs and boundaries are being disregarded. Singing, particularly religious songs, can feel deeply personal and symbolic, and you shouldn\u2019t be pressured to do something that makes you uncomfortable.\n\nIf you want to compromise, you could suggest supporting your sisters in another way, like introducing the performance or being present without singing. That way, you show respect for your family\u2019s traditions without compromising your values. At the end of the day, it\u2019s your choice, and your feelings are valid.",
