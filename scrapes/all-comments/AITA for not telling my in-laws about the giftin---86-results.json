      "selftext": "  \nFor context, The baby's 100th day is celebrated in my culture with a small party; essentially, family and friends gather between the 4th and 6th month of age. At this point, the infant takes her first mouthful of solid food and selects an item that is presumably meant to predict her future self. ( Its stupid but fun, eg, my daughter choose a pen, so we think she will be interested in studying.)  \nAdditionally everyone brings gifts for the baby, family usually gives gold, and friends give baby product.\n\n\n\nI've been with my husband for 6 years, and I can tell you that his family doesn't really like me. For the first four years of our relationship, I put a lot of effort into it, but once we were engaged and his family wasn't too enthusiastic, I gave up. Even though we still get together for celebrations, birthdays, and other events, I no longer make an effort to speak with them. (When we got engaged, my husband assured me that I didn't have to put in a lot of effort to win his family's approval, so I quit.)\n\n  \nMy in-laws haven't had a major part in our lives since we got married; we only see them 4 or 5 times a year. Since they haven't seen our baby yet, I invited them to this celebration. They were hesitant, attempting to argue that this isn't how we do things in our family and that we don't understand your foreign culture. I politely told them that it is their wish whether or not they want to see their grandchild, and I wouldn't force them to.  \n\n\nLast week, there were around 50 people to celebrate my beautiful child, the most of whom were from my side of the family. Everything was nice and pleasant, my MIL, FIL, and SIL arrived as well. After that, it was time for the presents. As previously said, every member of my family gave my child a gold earring, necklace, bracelet, or coin.  \n\n\nAt the party, my in-laws began to remark that it was a waste of money to give gold to a small child, but nobody listened. They then criticised me for not telling them that my family would spend so much money and accused me of making them look bad.\n\n  \nI apologised, explaining that it was simply part of our tradition and that I thought you wouldn't be interested because you had never been. They complained to my husband, he ignored them, but they still woudnt stop.  \n  \nit started of as me trying to make them look bad, to them now demanding i give them some of the gold as my daughter has no use for it and its meant to be shared with family.  \n  \n  \nWhen my husband and I stopped picking their calls, my SIL posted on instagram and facebook about child cruelty because our 6 month daughter has her ears pierced and wears small earrings. I get that its not common in the US hence why everyone now thinks i am torturing my baby. \n\n\n\nThe thing is I feel like i am not in the wrong, but when i read all the comments about me being a horrible parent and using my baby to make money it just feels bad. \n\ni am posting this to see if everyone thinks the same ig ?\n\n",

If your family marries into another culture, it's on you to learn. So you can not look stupid at celebrations and be able to interact with the other family.\n\n\nGoing no contact for a few months or for forever is up to OP. As long as her husband has her back and tells his family to knock it off.\n\n\nI understand the for a while concept, to set boundaries so they know you are serious. But these people sound like they will never learn.\n\n\nAlso how greedy to ask for the gold for the family. That goes into a bank account (it's what I would do but I'm just assuming).\n\n\nIt's for the child's future, not for the inlaws to spend.\u00a0 How horrible.\u00a0 I'd call them out on that, it's tacky as fuck.\n\n\nOp im glad you put your foot down and you aren't letting them walk all over you. They probably thought you'd crumble and give in. I'm glad you proved them wrong!",

It sounds like a sweet tradition, to be honest. I don't get the gold aspect, but it's gifts for baby that can be used when they're older, so it's still sweet, and I assume there's meaning behind it being gold from family. \n\nAs for the pierced ears, plenty of people in the West believe it's cruel to do that to young children, but there are a lot of cultures where it's tradition. I'm personally of the belief that ear piercing should wait until the individual can actually consent, but as long as you're taking care of the piercings, it's a brief pain the child won't remember, so I I wouldn't try to shame someone for doing it. \n\nYou did nothing wrong, here. But it may be time to consider further lowering contact with the ILs, or going completely NC with them.

I personally did not, because it's not my culture and I didn't want to make choices for my daughter like that, but it's not cruelty or abuse to make a different choice.
