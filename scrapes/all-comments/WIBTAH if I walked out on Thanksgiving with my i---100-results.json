      "selftext": "UPDATE at the end\n\nSo my in-laws have a nasty habit of asking me to bring something to Thanksgiving dinner only for me to find said item/dish already there. We are not normally a large crew so having two of the same dish is very wasteful. My relationship with my in-laws has been on the rocks since 2020 coming to a head a year ago and we are walking on eggshells now. \n\nThis year I told my husband I wouldn't cook anything but would only bring wine or something store bought. I told him that I am unwilling to put time and effort into cooking something only to have it go to waste. He listed off a few dishes I make thay he loves that his in laws wouldn't ever make for Thanksgiving. I stood my ground though and said no and why. So he agreed and let it go. \n\nHowever the numbers are in and there will be a large group this year. I couldn't stop myself (lord help me and my stupid people pleasing self) I asked what I could bring to ease the load. They shockingly told me a rather important dish. So of course I will make it. \n\nI told my husband if I show up and they have already made said dish -AGAIN- I will turn my butt right around and walk back out. That I am no longer willing to put up with this stupid mind game. He thinks that would be dramatic and I should just put mine out anyway and they will love it because I am such a good cook. I don't believe anyone will even try it if there is one by his parents already there. \n\nSo WIBTAH if I walk out without a word or should I just suck it up - again. \n\n\nEDIT/UPDATE\n\nYou all are fantastic, I read every single post, thank you so much for your support and guidance. I won't keep you waiting, we just got back from the most wonderful evening with the in laws. No duplicate dishes in sight. I know my husband talked to them last year after I refused to go, but I wasn't sure it did anything other than make me look bad, but a lot happened this year - one of my in law went through a prolonged illness and it brought everything into focus and brought us all back together. Simply put I was afraid after letting them all back in and being vulnerable - I would have been shattered completely if things had gone backwards. But we had the most lovely and fun time together. My heart is light and full.  I hope you all had a fantastic day as well. - may your leftovers be delicious and your shopping deals be abundant \ud83e\udd83\ud83e\udd67\ud83c\udf77",

It is time for him to call his own mother and double check that there is nobody else making this dish. \u00a0\n\nAnd not to let her get a word in edgewise as he says\u2026 Mom, I am calling to make sure that my wife is not making a duplicate of a dish that somebody else is bringing. Because you have asked her to do this multiple times. And we\u2019re not playing this game again.\u00a0\n\nIf there is a duplicate of this dish, we are going to turn around and walk out. So you better make certain that that doesn\u2019t happen. Because if it does, we won\u2019t be coming to Thanksgiving again either. \u00a0\n\nNotice how that it makes him deal with his own family\u2019s shit? You should absolutely not be stressing over this. And especially not after having this happen multiple times.\n\nI understand that in a lot of families, it\u2019s just easier to put up with this behavior. But that\u2019s why it continues. It is time for your husband to understand that he\u2019s a grown adult now. And whether or not he puts up with bullshit from his family is entirely up to him, not them.\n\nIt is also time for him to understand that when he took those marriage vows with you and said he was going to forsake all others, that included his family.\n\nThat didn\u2019t just mean sleeping with someone else. That meant that you are now my priority. That meant that if somebody is doing something to hurt you, I will step in as needed. Because you are now my nuclear family.\n\nIt\u2019s time for him to step in.\u00a0",
