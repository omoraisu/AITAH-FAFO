      "selftext": "\nI\u2019m (29f) recently going through some life struggles. My child is severely disabled and I haven\u2019t been able to find work recently to accommodate his complex schedule. I haven\u2019t no friends or family to help me with childcare and I don\u2019t quality for income assistance due to his income being taken into consideration. \nDue to this I\u2019ve been in financial strain, my partner (26m) has become increasingly more irritated with me on a daily basis.\nI\u2019ve been experiencing panic attacks, and intense almost debilitating anxiety. I take care of myself the best I can, but the physical symptoms of my ptsd are really effecting me. Deep pressure stimulation and physical touch helps a lot. I asked him for a hug and make a chat to help calm me down, and he essentially told me I should seek proper help, as a hug is only temporary and I have deeper issues going on. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with ptsd since I was 10, I\u2019ve been to multiple different types of therapies but nothing seems to really help unfortunately for me. \nAITA for not seeking more help for myself sooner? And expecting support from him in the mean time, or at all? ",

I understand finding someone to help is hard but you gotta want to help yourself even outside of therapy. He's your partner not your saviour or there to fix you. You gotta deal with your own issues to some degree. \nIt kinda sounds like hes using you for financial reasons and to watch his child and I'm assuming take care of all the household responsibilities because he leaves the house for work and is working 90% of the time and probably tired?(AGAIN assuming, just a very common issue I hear women have and I also had myself) And it slightly sounds like you might be using him for financial reasons as well. What's his relationship like with his coparent? Why did they split?(patterns often repeat with relationships) You mentioned about not being able to work because of childcare, but there's lots of online jobs available, clean company also sometimes allow you to bring children along with you, and especially for a situation like you have with your child I could see a cleaning company being extremely understanding. Also what about your children other parent? Why not ask for some extra help from them to take some of the weight off of you? You mentioned your boyfriend is 50/50 with his coparent, maybe see if they can adjust their schedules so you aren't responsible for his child on top of your own children?? It's awesome you guys are a little family and you've been helping him with his child but super unfair for you to be struggling and him make you be his sons caregiver on top of caring for your own children. I really hope you get everything figured out, you and your children deserve to be happy.",
