      "selftext": "Let\u2019s call my friend\u00a0*Jake*. A few months ago, Jake borrowed $50 from me. He said it was for an emergency, and I didn\u2019t hesitate because, hey, that\u2019s what friends are for, right? He promised to pay me back within three months.\n\nWell, those three months came and went. I\u2019ve dropped a few friendly reminders since, but Jake always has a reason why he can\u2019t pay me yet tight finances, unexpected expenses, you name it. I haven\u2019t made a huge fuss because I get that money can be tight, but it\u2019s been six months now, and I haven\u2019t seen a single cent.\n\nNow, let\u2019s introduce another mutual friend,\u00a0*Mark*. Jake borrowed money from Mark recently, too, though I didn\u2019t know about it until last week. Apparently, Mark is asking for his money back, and Jake is feeling the pressure. Jake came to me and asked if I could lend him $30 **to pay Mark back.**\n\nI told Jake no. I said it didn\u2019t make sense for me to lend him more money when he still owes me $50. He got defensive, saying this was different because Mark really needs the money back, and that I should \"understand as a friend.\" I told him I do understand, but this isn\u2019t fair to me.\n\nNow Jake is upset with me, and Mark has also chimed in. Mark thinks I should\u2019ve lent Jake the money to help \"resolve the situation\" and said, \"It\u2019s not like Jake doesn\u2019t\u00a0*want*\u00a0to pay you back.\"\n\nI feel bad because I don\u2019t want to ruin my friendships, but I also feel like Jake shouldn\u2019t keep borrowing from one friend to pay off another.   \n  \nAITAH here for refusing to lend him the money?",
