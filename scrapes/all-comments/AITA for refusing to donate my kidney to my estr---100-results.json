      "selftext": "I (28F) was raised by my mom after my dad walked out on us when I was 5. He left to start a new family and had little to no contact with me growing up. He never paid child support or even called on birthdays or holidays. For years, I struggled with feelings of abandonment, but I eventually moved on and built a life without him.\n\nFast forward to now\u2014out of the blue, I get a call from his wife telling me my father is very sick and needs a kidney transplant. She told me that I\u2019m the best match and begged me to get tested. Apparently, his other family members aren\u2019t compatible.\n\nI told her no. I don\u2019t owe him anything after the way he treated me. He made his choices when he abandoned me and my mom, and I feel no obligation to put myself through a major surgery for someone who\u2019s essentially a stranger to me.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been bombarded with messages from his side of the family, calling me selfish and heartless. They say I\u2019m letting him die out of spite and that I need to \u201cbe the bigger person.\u201d Even my mom thinks I should consider it, not for him, but to avoid carrying guilt if he passes away.\n\nI don\u2019t feel guilty. I feel like he\u2019s reaping what he sowed, but part of me wonders if I\u2019m being too harsh.\n\nAITA for refusing to donate my kidney to the father who abandoned me?",

You could even go there as if you are having the blood test and tell the transplant team you are being pressured. They will tell his family that you are not a match. They won\u2019t give a reason due to HIPAA.  Definitely tell them. It will stop the harassment at least. Please do this for yourself. (Tell the hospital I mean).</p>\n</div>",
