      "selftext": "I (20M) just got a nice work opportunity in an office and I'm so grateful for it, it has been over 2 months and it's going great work-wise. However, I've been developing a few uncomfortable feelings with a few colleagues. Mostly, with one female that has an age ranging from 25 to 30. I don't understand why she is always pushing for us to hang out together after work. At first, i really didn't know how to say \"no\" so I went and she ended up having me sleep over at her house, while staying awake to watch her do coke and arrive late at work the morning after. I really don't understand what I am doing wrong. I don't know why people feel so comfortable doing this to me, unveiling their deepest selves and problems with me and presuming that I would be ok with it. I don't understand. It happened again, I said \"no\" but she kept saying \"but why don't you come? Come on, come. This month we only have these days free together\" and I ended up going. The last few days she sat next to me at work and I kept developing uncomfortable feelings. I feel like a narcissist who doesn't want friends but I don't know what to do. I have her mannerisms and ways of speaking in my mind and I feel so angry everytime i go to sleep. Her ways of expressing herself, at her age, invoke a deep rage within me. I don't know what's happening. Advice?",
