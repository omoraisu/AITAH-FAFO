My parents do instacart as their job because my dad doesnt allow my mom to work since hes a big baby but thats not the point recently they have been gathering enough money for Christmas like i said im grateful for anything i get but thats until 3 days ago when my parents decided to buy a 60,000 dollar car...\nWE DO NOT HAVE THE MONEY TO CONTINUE PAYING FOR IT and then i asked my mom if we have enough money for christmas and she said you can get something within 20 dollars and i was just so annoyed because all of this money they saved up for BILLS and Christmas was all thrown to a car they only wwnt to show off we barely grt by on our bills and literally my parents do not want to work to the point where my brother has to give them money and i argued with my mom and she said \"okay do your not gonna be grateful your not gonna get any presents\" but literally you made this choice your acting like we had no money even though we did to buy a car that we didnt need especially since i have 5 other siblings living jn this house im just so annoyed they do not care about us this is only time of the year i can ask for stuff without me having to pay because they are so frugal and always have been like this so i just need to be let known aita im mot sure if I'm acting spoiled or just allowed to have these feelings considering they literally told us they were saving up for Christmas ",
