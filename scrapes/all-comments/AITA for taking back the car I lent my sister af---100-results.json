      "selftext": "I (25F) bought a used car last year and have been letting my sister (22F) use it while she gets back on her feet. She\u2019s had a tough time financially after leaving her job, and since I work from home, I don\u2019t use the car much. We agreed she could use it as long as she covered gas and basic maintenance.\n\nRecently, I found out she\u2019s been letting her boyfriend, who I don\u2019t trust, drive the car. I only learned about this when a neighbor mentioned seeing someone else parking it. When I confronted her, she admitted it, saying her boyfriend needed it for a \u201cquick errand,\u201d but it\u2019s happened multiple times.\n\nI was furious because we agreed the car was for her use only. Her boyfriend isn\u2019t insured under my policy, which puts me at risk if anything happens. I told her I couldn\u2019t let her use the car anymore and took back the keys. She called me selfish and said I was overreacting, claiming she only lent it to him occasionally.\n\nOur parents are split\u2014my dad thinks I was too harsh, but my mom says I\u2019m justified since it\u2019s my car and my rules. My sister hasn\u2019t stopped texting me about how hard I\u2019ve made her life.\n\nAITA for taking back the car after she broke the rules?",
