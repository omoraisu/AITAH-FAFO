      "selftext": "Not really the asshole, but am I wrong for getting a 3rd cat ?\n\nI recently adopted a black 6 month old kitten. She's sweet, mellow besides the occasional playing throughout the day and shes crazy smart. She doesn't scratch furniture, jump on counters or break shit. She's an angel really. Plays like a dog, total sweetie. \n\nBut I already have 2 cats and a dog, and my sister told me it's too many pets and that I'm neglecting my dog who doesn't have much time left (my dog is 11) Which I'm not, the dog gets exercised and plenty of love. Apparently she thinks I'm taking away precious attention from her. Which, I guess i see her point? \n\nThing is, I do live alone in a small apartment (650 square ft) but all cats do is lounge most of the day. \n\nCat #1 is 15 yrs old, cat #2 is 7 yrs old and cat #3 is 6 months and they all coexist peacefully. \n\nThe dog is a bit jealous sometimes and wines for extra cuddles but I reassure her and figure as long as im exercising her she will be fine. \n\nIdk, i love my senior dog and senior cat to pieces but I worry about what will happen to my 7 yr old and myself  when their time comes. And I figured introducing in a new sibling now would be best God forbid we lose them close together.\n\nI have the money to afford them, and they are very loved. So am AITA  ?",
