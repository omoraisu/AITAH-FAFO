So they were fighting late at night as per usual and normally I ignore it because I don\u2019t care, but this time, this fucking time my cat was stuck in there room and he was meowing too be let out and only I heard it apparently. So I did what is leading me to posting this, I swung  open there door called them pathetic and did something that I look back on and cringe, I spit on the floor to try and signal disrespect. So words were exchanged and I ended up feeling like the villain at the end of the day, but hey atleast I saved my cat, I may have destroyed my relationship with my parents but my cat loves me bruh \ud83d\udc80.",
