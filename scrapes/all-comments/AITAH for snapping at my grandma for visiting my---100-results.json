      "selftext": "I'm 30m, I've lost my mom (dad was never in my life) when I was 16 to suicide. We were devastated. My grandparents (76f and 78m) fully adopted me, we became really close. I love them dearly. My granddad is super chill and withdrawn, but because of that he is submissive to my grandma almost completely. My grandma on the other hand is very strong willed and emotional, even to the point of being emotionally manipulative (for example, she starts crying very easily if there is a disagreement, and takes advantage of it, she knows I can't handle her crying). I know she's hurt from losing her daughter and she's terrified of anything happening to me, but that control and manipulation with combination of depression , definitely screwed my late teens and early 20s, to the point of me having basically no social life. \n\nAt some point I've convinced them that I need to move out from them and have some boundaries. I have an apartment left from mom, so I moved out there and it's very close to them, so I could visit often. \nAt first it was like a breath of fresh air, I was still sort of financially dependent on them, while I was studying, but I felt like I took control of my life, but then they started visiting my home unannounced, even when I was not there (yes, they have a key to my apartment). They've justified their visits by bringing food and going through my stuff under the justification of helping me with cleaning. At first I didn't mind it, even though I didn't need such help, I humored them, after all, they were just trying to help. \nBut I got a strong feeling that they've just using that as an excuse to check if I'm not doing anything \"bad\". Grandma often commented and judged my eating habits and my house order. The feeling of being constantly monitored started to mentally drain me, so I've asked them to stop doing so, or at least ask me beforehand. They've agreed and that helped for couple of years,everything was great. \n\nNow I'm working and completely independent financially from them and grandma definitely feel like she lost control over my life, so she started visiting unannounced again, and when I am asking her why she's here, why didn't she called, she straight up says \"well I wanted to see you and how are your living conditions\". My grandad says he is against this, but doesn't want to upset her. I've tried calmly explaining to them that this very rude and very stressful that they show up when I am not expecting it, they don't understand it. Mind you they are almost 80,so them walking over to me is also not very safe, especially in the winter, I would much rather to visit them instead. They've fallen and hurted themselves multiple times, thankfully nothing serious.\n\n  So yesterday, I had a day off work, I was feeling lazy, I ordered some food and decided to leave most of my house chores for Sunday,I got a call from granddad saying that they are coming over. He thought calling 5 min before their visit was good enough. I was really upset when they came and didn't hide it, but then she started commenting on the state of my apartment and the fact that I was eating junk food. That really pissed me off, and I blew up at her. Told her that not going to let them in anymore and that I going to change my locks. She became really upset and stormed off, my grandad says she's been crying to a day now and doesn't want to talk to me. I'll be honest, I feel terrible that I've lost my temper with her, but I also feel like I'm in the right. I'm not a teenager anymore, I'm a grown ass man, even if they don't think so. I know she means well and she's just worried, but her actions are stressing me out. AITAH for being angry with her? I will most likely apologise either way, but I want to know if my anger is unreasonable all together. \n\nSorry for the long post, will probably delete it after a while. Just need some advice on how to handle my situation. ",
