      "selftext": "\nI want to keep this short but will expand on whatever needed. \n\nMy parents are divorced and I am currently my father's full time caretaker since he has dementia. I haven't spoken to my mom in about four years now because she did not have a social security number for me, refused to get me help with it, and blew off helping me with college. \n\nFirst, when I was 18 i tried to file my taxes for the first time, and it returned as already filed. I asked my mom why this would happen and she said literally \"probably because of your social security number, I don't know how we got that or if it's even yours or not\". This lead to a huge quagmire or going to the social security office over and over again trying to figure out if my number was mine or not or if I could even use it. The office decided I was issued the wrong number and gave me a new one. To this day I still have issues with banks pulling info off my credit reports that has nothing to do with me locking me from accounts and this info doesn't show in any credit report I get.\n\nSecond, she refused to get me help. After going to the social security office 12 times and being told something different each time, I told my mom this is not resolving the issue, and asked my mom if we can please talk to a lawyer just to get a list of things I need to do to get this resolved so I can focus on going to college and getting on with my life, as this was starting to interfere with my ability to get loans or files for FASFA. She said it was too expensive and not serious enough. I went to the social security office again and told them what my mom told me, they issued me the wrong number and needed to give me a new one. They ended up doing that and she has since called the issue resolved, despite my credit reports still being fucked up. \n\nThird, she blew off helping me with college. The previous two issues were further complicated by my mom telling me I needed to move to another state to establish residency for a year, then she would move to the same state to a town with a community college in it so I could live with her and she would cover my rent and help pay for school. I was working two full time jobs to afford rent in a new city with no one I knew. I did that, and she said she needed another year to get organized. That was okay with me even though I was living paycheck to paycheck barely making a living, because she was promising to help me with pretty much everything. She put it off year after year, while promising me weekly she would follow through and move, until 5 years had gone by, I was struggling the whole time and telling her all about it, finally I told her she needed her to now help me like she said or I can't talk to her anymore. She told me she would not be moving or helping me with paying for community college. We haven't spoken since. When she told me that it completely broke my hopes and dreams, I was so depressed I stopped showing up at work as there wasn't a point to life anymore, and became homeless for a few years, before moving back with my dad to help him.\n\nI keep telling my family my only requirement for re-establishing contact is an explanation, why did she tell me it was too expensive and not serious enough when neither of those are true? They are telling me even though it's not the explanation I want to hear, it's the one I'm getting, she just thought it wasn't serious, it cost too much, that's it, and I need to get over it for the sake of the family. How does this make sense at all? Am I going crazy?\n\nTL;DR - Family is telling me to \"just get over\" my mom blowing off helping me with college or even having a social security number for me without any explanation, apology or even acknowledgement that she did these things, am I wrong for thinking that's unfair and not okay? \n\n",
