      "selftext": "my girlfriend has been on prozac for her mood swings right before her period(PMDD). she's been on it as long as I've known her. well her insurance decided to drop her off it and say she cant get it anymore so she's been fighting it but she ran out just as her last period ended and I honestly thought it wouldn't be that bad but ooooh man was i wrong.\n\nSo, her period is supposed to start in 4 days, she's supposed to take her prozac starting on day 15 of her cycle which is 12 days before her period starts. and its like she's a totally different person, asking if I'm mad at her, overstimulated easily, kinda withdrawn. she knows she gets like this so i assume she's distancing herself so she doesn't end up snapping at me.\n\nwell a couple days ago we were picking her kids up from her ex husbands and they were talking fine at first but then I could tell she was getting irritated, i was getting annoyed too, but this guy decided to act a fool and shoved her up against the car and got in her face because she said \"well if you were around more often Zoe wouldn't be scared to be here.\" (they divorced when Zoe was a baby, she turned 4 in July.) and before i could get around the car she rocked him so hard he was snoring before he hit the ground and i was kinda stuck there in shock.\n\nshe sat him up and woke him up and told him that if he ever felt the need to touch her like that again she wouldn't hesitate to have him end up like her uncle....who needed his entire head restructured after a car crash where the car rolled over his head.\n\ni am slightly intimidated now....i honestly think she was warranted for doing what she did but my friend says she should have just shut up (i told him off for that)",
