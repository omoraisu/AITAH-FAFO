      "selftext": "I (29F) have a bit of a family dilemma, and I\u2019m feeling conflicted about whether I\u2019m in the wrong here, so I\u2019d appreciate some perspective.\n\nI\u2019ve always had a good relationship with my sister (34F), but she\u2019s definitely the more spontaneous and disorganized one, and I\u2019m the more planned and responsible sibling. She has a 4-year-old daughter, Emma, and I absolutely adore my niece\u2014she\u2019s funny, sweet, and I love spending time with her.\n\nHere\u2019s the situation: Last week, my sister called me up around 2 p.m. and asked if I could come over and watch Emma for a few hours that evening because she and her husband (who I\u2019ll call Ben) had \"last-minute\" tickets to a concert. She said they\u2019d been planning this for months but didn\u2019t realize they had nobody to watch Emma until the day of.\n\nI was a little taken aback by the short notice but figured I could help out\u2014except for the fact that I already had plans that evening. I\u2019ve been juggling a lot at work, and I had promised myself a quiet night in to recharge, especially since I\u2019ve been feeling a little burned out lately. I told my sister I couldn\u2019t babysit because I already had plans, but she started to insist, saying she\u2019d really\u00a0*appreciate*\u00a0it and that Emma would be fine with me, she just needed someone to watch her for a few hours.\n\nI gently told her that I wasn\u2019t available, and that I thought it was a bit last-minute to be asking me to babysit in the first place. I also mentioned that I needed some downtime, as I\u2019ve been feeling pretty drained lately. That\u2019s when she got upset and started saying that I was being selfish and that family helps family. She said that she didn\u2019t have many other options and that this concert was important for her and Ben to unwind. She even threw in that I never seem to make time for her and Emma, and that this would be a perfect chance for us to bond.\n\nI ended up sticking to my decision and politely told her I couldn\u2019t help. I wasn\u2019t trying to be cruel, but I genuinely needed that time for myself.\n\nSince then, she\u2019s been texting me with passive-aggressive messages about how \u201cnice it is to know where I stand\u201d and \u201cI guess I\u2019ll just have to find someone else who\u00a0*actually*\u00a0cares about their niece.\u201d She also told me that she didn\u2019t realize I was so \u201cbusy\u201d and that if I\u00a0*really*\u00a0cared about her, I\u2019d prioritize her needs. She also mentioned that Ben\u2019s mom (who\u2019s not exactly close to me) had agreed to watch Emma last-minute, and I should have done the same.\n\nNow, I\u2019m feeling kind of guilty, but at the same time, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s unreasonable for me to want to keep my plans. I don\u2019t know what she expected\u2014especially with such little notice\u2014and I don\u2019t want to be taken for granted either.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to babysit my niece when it was last-minute and I already had plans?\n\n  \n**Edit after reading comments:**\n\nThank you all so much for the feedback! I really appreciate the perspectives and suggestions you\u2019ve shared.\n\nI want to clarify a few things because I realize some details weren\u2019t clear in my original post. First off, I absolutely love my niece\u2014she\u2019s amazing, and I adore spending time with her whenever I can. I also love my sister, but she\u2019s always been the type to leave things to the last minute and then rely on others to pick up the slack, especially when it comes to taking care of Emma. This isn\u2019t the first time I\u2019ve been put in a situation where I\u2019m expected to drop everything because she\u2019s in a bind, and while I understand that life happens, it\u2019s been a pattern that\u2019s worn on me a bit.\n\nI know some of you suggested that I could have been more understanding, and I definitely see that side of it. I\u2019m not trying to be cold or unsupportive, but I\u2019ve been feeling really burnt out lately, and I had already made plans for some much-needed downtime. It\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t want to help; it just felt like the timing was off, especially given the last-minute request and the fact that I\u2019ve been juggling a lot of stress at work.",
