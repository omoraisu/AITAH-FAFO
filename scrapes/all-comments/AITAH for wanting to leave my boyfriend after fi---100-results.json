      "selftext": "Basically they've conversed maybe a total of 8 times in the past 18 months, each time about mutual friends (a friend passed away), a picture of the animal they owned together and a hi or bye. He usually stops answering first but this last time made me feel much worse than I had already felt (which BTW was pretty fuckin bad).\n\nThey texted about the animal briefly and for the first time I've seen, he asked her how she's been. Asked and answered, truly very generic and distant interaction. \n\nHowever, she then asked him if he's still dating me lol. To which he didn't respond :) \n\nJust to get ahead of this- I have no idea why I haven't left him. I hesitate to say this cause it sounds dumb coming after what I just said but we have an incredible relationship other than this fucking issue. \n\nThey were together for maybe 3 1/2 years and separated a year or so when I met him and she's moved away. The first time or two I found out they had texted was a few months into our relationship and then maybe a month or two again after. I confronted him and he promised he blocked her. Since then I've found him texting her three times and I haven't said anything because it feels pointless. \n\nWe live together and have been staying with eachother since a month or two after we met. The time I confronted him I packed all my stuff at his house and nearly ended the relationship. Which is why I guess he swore he'd blocked her although I guess he didn't. But I stayed. And he's done it again. And this time hurts so fucking bad because we'll why was that the conversation ender for him. \n\nThese texts are so innocent that it's making me feel fucking insane and I dont have an ex of that long who I was in such a serious relationship with so idk if it's normal or if I am justified for feeling a growing sense of resentment against him. \n\nHow do you feel about the idea of a significant other texting their ex like this? Can it really be innocent or is it always a bad sign?",
