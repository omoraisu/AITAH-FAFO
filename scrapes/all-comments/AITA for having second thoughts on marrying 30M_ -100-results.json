      "selftext": "Should I 31F marry my Fianc\u00e9 30M after I found he has been messaging other women?\n\n  I don\u2019t really know where to start... I am meant to be marrying my Fianc\u00e9 next year but not sure i can go through with it. I am scared of making the wrong decision. I guess I need to explain from the beginning of our relationship. I've been with my Fianc\u00e9 for just over 7 years, we have lived together for 6 of that and engaged for 3 years. I love this man more than anyone I have ever loved and don't know if I could ever love a man more. We had it really good, like crazy mad for each other and it felt like we didn't get out of the honeymoon stage. We was unseparable from the moment we first met, it was like we'd been together for years. We just knew each other Soulmates from the beginning. But there had been problems been some issues from the start, he smoked weed and i wasn't someone who was ever into it. But the longer I was with him, I started to smoke it myself and was doing it more & more. That was his thing and I like to enjoy spending time with him so it ended up being our chill thing together.  As years got on I've become more and more dependent on it. I'm aware I need to stop and said we both need to stop & support each other but always ends up going back to it. It was my way of forgetting things, we have always struggled financially as a couple.  We always have problems with work, either can't hold one down or get enough hours. I have a career and done pretty well for myself.  I'm not saying I'm well off but earn enough to have saving a do a few nice things. However because he always struggled couldn't save or just havw the drive strive better, i would always end up helping him cover his side of the bills. I would say out of our while 6 years together at least 5 years I have helped him financially some way or another.  Now I totally understand we all go through bad patches and things don't always go the way you planned. But when do you draw the line? Like don't get me wrong I am all for support to help someone better themselves.  He doesn't have like a skill or trade, his thing that strives him to a career. I, his mum and my family have offered support for training but he does nothing.  Always uses the excuse I don't have the money(each one of us has either offered to pay full or part towards it) I speak to him about it, offer words of encouragement, try to spark ideas of what he wants to do, what jobs etc. Its almost like he closes himself off or can't be bothered or even just happy for me to cover his side financially and  have it the easy way. I have ways just pushed through it hoping one day he finds it and keep saying to myself you have to.go through the bad to enjoy the good.  Trying to keep positive as I felt so lucky to be with a man who loves me so much and it's us against the world. Well until May this year. \n\nSome time in May we had been talking about for quite a while, years in fact about exploring doing threesomes. I had one previous to our relationship and my Fianc\u00e9 hadn't.  We agreed after much thought about exploring together before we marry so neither of us felt like there was things we missed out on or wanted to explore sexually. We both decided boundaries which was each try mmf & ffm once each. Including we must do both not exclusively one so it is not one sided. We both said if anyone got uncomfortable we stop and we only talk as a 3 in the same chat and not separately so we both can see the conversations. So we started to speak to another F can't remember her age. Things went well and we set a date. We both made it clear what we wanted to try and agreed to stop of not comfortable.  Things went well and we had fun. We did end up finishing a but sooner than expected as I hurt my leg and was in a lot of pain. But nevertheless he had sex with her and touched her. Now going on to mmf as I said we agreed to do both and only fair of we experienced both.  So same thing  as before we started speaking to someone and set up a group chat together. This time was a bit different,  he got a bit upset and couldn't handle another guy talking to me. He also said he wasn't sure what he wanted to explore or what he was comfortable doing from a mm side but wasn't happy doing a mmf with a straight m. The longer we was talking to another m he was getting cold feet about it. I was a bit upset he had changed his mind after we agreed if we do one then we do the other. But after thought I understood and we stopped.  At the same time I discovered something I would of never thought in a million years would happen.  One day I was going down his gallery on his phone to look at our holiday pictures from Italy in February as I knew he had some he didn't send me.(we have an open phone policy ) To find a load of explict pictures of woman,  now I've seen he has that kind of thing in his phone before as an ex work colleague sends him stuff. What Man doesn't have at least one friend who does it. Well to be sure I looked at where the source of the image was from, to find where he had been sent it. Straight away my stomach dropped, I felt sick to the bone and couldn't believe what I was seeing. He had been sending messages on different social media accounts,  i even found a fake accounts. He had been sending private messages to other woman making comments about their tits, asking for their Snapchat and had even asked & send pictures including nudes. I was totally heart broken, felt like he had ripped my heart up into a million pieces and thrown it all away. I spoke to him right away and asked why & what was going on. All he kept saying was sorry and he didn't know why he did it. That he loves me and wants to be with me. But these messages had spaned over a 18 months.  I was so hurt and asked for space. Which we both did but my head & heart was fighting each other. All he said after we had some time away was that he was lonely and that is why he did it. Even though we had a pretty decent sex life, he was lying in bed next to be messaging these girls. It made me feel so ugly and unwanted that he would rather message strangers than wake me up. I had even told him many times he could wake me up.  Well after a week I decided to move past this and try to rebuild our relationship.  We stopped with mmf exploration and just really work on our relationship.  We was due to get married in June next year and had a holiday booked for September this year. About 5 to 6 weeks went by still trying to move on even with a few disagreements. Things were really tough he was barely getting enough money to cover 2/3 of the bills and struggling to get the hours at work. At this point I really started to lose my faith and fuse with it all. Thinking nothing could get worse. Until I found more chats, I was on his tablet as mine was dead and it's my old tablet anyway so we always just share things no need to ask. I go onto the files as it had an email of my still logged it and I was hoping to see if I had a file with passwords on. Well what I found was something I most definitely thought i wouldn't find again, images of another woman. This time it was a load of screen recordings he's done from a live stream. Now I don't have a problem with him watching porn but to be watching a chat stream and screen recording videos up to 20 mins at a time knowing I'm next to him in bed, just made me feel so unwanted again and wondering what the hell I'm doing. I also find he had been joing adult groups on Facebook and been making comments about womans tits & body that he has never said to me before.  All I've done is give and support, to have him constantly throwing it back in my face. I never ask for anything but to love me and not break my trust. I don't demand for gifts,  treats or trips. I am a pretty independent woman and if I want something I will pay for it myself. We go out for dinner i often pay for it or we halfs. Just really broke me, all I want as I said to be loved but I'm now questioning is that enough. Should I be treated like a princess and not be made to feel unwanted after all that he has done to be on multiple occasions.  We are due to go away in September as its his 30th birthday, I've paid near over 2k for the holiday as I always like to make him feel special. But then I remember when it was my 30th the year before it took him 9 months after my birthday to get me a present and he did nothing only a card but not even get me a cake for it. As I've been questioning more and more what am I doing i start to feel it's been very one sided relationship.  All I do is give and he takes with little return. He says he loves me gives me hugs makes me a cup of tea and dinner now and again. But that's as far as it goes. I guess some people don't even get that, but I want more. I want to be made to feel special.  Going  back to the 2nd time I find these messages, after much thought I gave him an ultimatum that he need to sort his financial situation either get bitter job or second job or whatever to ensure he has the stability to pay the bills each month. I also said i don't ever want to find these kind of messages or him making comments like that again as I was uncomfortable with it. I gave him 2 months to start making an improvement which I thought is fair. We had also had been trying for a baby before all these messages were discovered wirh no luck. I had done some testing but needed him to do some. I had waited 10 months for him to even book the Dr's appointment.  So I said he needed to sort this out also. He agreed with all these actions and said he would prove it to me. I wanted our relationship to work so badly. I believe things don't come easy and we all have to work at things. But there does come a point where I feel the relationship is unsalvageable. But I had to give it one more shot, I mean I love him and still waited to get married to him. Although I was starting to have my doubts. \n\nHe gets a new job, a bartender which he was doing previously.  Crap hours but we both understand so we can save for the wedding and pay the bills. Things are going well, he is starting to get funds behind him. Getting regular hours and things are looking up. We have our holiday in September and have a great time with him, his Mum  & Step  Dad  and Auntie too.  Who I get on very well with. I can safely say I have a good mother in law, she is family to me and she calls me her daughter.  Last month we celebrated our 7th Anniversary we didn't do much as he didn't have loads of money due to being off work from an injury.  But nevertheless we had a nice time. Now this injury i won't skip over, he had to be off 3 weeks so we was struggling a bit.  I could cover his side but it meant I had to dig into the wedding fund which I have mostly saved for. In fact I have paid for most of it, but since his new job he had been giving bits where he could afford too. His work situation changed after his accident as legal issues had occurred which i won't go into detail but meant he needed to get legal advice. But I supported him through this as ita not his fault,  unfortunately he hasn't helped himself and not spoken to solicitor as of yet. He often doesn't do things he's not comfortable or never done before hoping I would hold his hand through the situation.  I have had enough of it and taken a step back as he needs to grow up. \n\n\nSkip forward 4 weeks to Saturday 7th December, i am on his PC as we both are paying a game currently and he let's me play on his PC as he share everything.  I done something I'm not proud of but needed a peace of mine. I went down his google photos to see if he still had those images and make sure he didn't have anymore. Well to my disappointment I find a load of screen shots from a particular nudes model. Now I start to do more digging,  end up finding he has newly set up a fake X account and set an only fans account. His excuse is that we had spoke about doing videos but I made clear I didn't want to risk my job.  Then that was that, but he made a new account at the end of last month 3 months after we discussed and shut the idea down. I then find a private message on Instagram asking to see pictures and for her Snapchat. Again this is not the first time I've seen him ask for other womans Snapchat, knowing I can't see what's been sent. I don't know what's been said or what he's done on Snapchat and dread to think about it tbh. I confronted him about it this morning and all he has done is said sorry. I asked him if he wants to be with me and why . But I'm just getting the same old crap, I've asked for space and I really don't know what to do. I feel so lost right now. Whilst writing this post I picked up the tablet to quote what he said to find he's signed out of Instagram which does says he is still hiding something from me and doesn't want me to find it again. Part of me feels like just messages and pictures as far as he went. But I really don't know anymore he could of slept with someone else, there's plenty of opportunities for him to do some. We work at different times and I do go away overnight now & again for work. I guess I need to think long and hard about what I need to do. But I know whatever it is, it will be my hardest decision ever. I do feel like a total failure and that no man wants to ever marry me. This is my 3rd engagement with someone and each & everytime it's failed. I just feel like its something I've done wrong and the world is telling me I don't deserve to be happy.  After spending too long writing this, I feel like a massive weight as been taken off. My mental health as been really effected the last year and I do feel like I've lost my spark in life. This week has been particularly hard and I have felt like it all would be easier if I wasn't here. I know I shouldn't say that and I really don't want to end it all. But the more time has gone on, the more I start to feel like it's the better outcome. Thanks for spending time out of your day to read this and i apologise for any grammar & spelling mistakes its 1am, I'm tired and head all over the place. I will try and give an update as time goes on. But now it's time for me to simmer over what is the best thing to do. I'm going to take time apart although we live in the same house, I may go over to my mums for a few days. Also to add we don't have any children but a dog which is our fur baby. I'm worried what will happen if we do part and scared he might do something silly as he had made comments about hurting himself before.  ",
