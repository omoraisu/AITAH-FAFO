      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I need some outside perspective on this situation with my mom.\n\nFor context, my mom and I have a complicated relationship. We were estranged for several years when I was a teenager because of her struggles with addiction. We\u2019ve since reconnected, but things are still rocky. She\u2019s often dealing with health issues and family drama, and I\u2019ve tried to support her, but honestly, it\u2019s emotionally exhausting.\n\nRecently, when it became clear who the winner of the 2024 election would be, we had a heated conversation about Trump winning. I shared how devastated I felt because of how it impacts me personally (I\u2019m in a same-sex marriage, and I\u2019m deeply concerned about LGBTQ+ rights and abortion access). My mom felt I was being unfair in how I expressed my fears, and the conversation left us both hurt. Since then, things have been tense, and we haven\u2019t talked much.\n\nEarlier today, we had a phone conversation where she told me about a painful medical issue she\u2019s dealing with. I expressed sympathy and tried to be supportive, but the conversation took a turn. She said I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to struggle financially or live in pain. That upset me because, during the years we were estranged, I went through my own struggles that she wasn\u2019t there to witness. I pointed this out\u2014not to attack her, but to correct what felt like an unfair statement.\n\nShe took this as me throwing her mistakes in her face and got really defensive. Then she made a jab about how I should \u201cgo argue with my husband\u201d (who I don\u2019t even argue with much, so this felt unnecessary). The conversation ended with her saying she didn\u2019t want to argue and hanging up.\n\nShe called back a few minutes later, but I didn\u2019t pick up because I felt too upset and didn\u2019t think I deserved to be treated that way. I sent her a text afterward saying I didn\u2019t want to talk at the moment and hoped she felt better soon.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been reflecting on our relationship. I feel like every conversation eventually leads to tension or drama, and honestly, I\u2019m just tired of it. I have a lot of good things happening in my life right now (a new job, a raise, plans to move out of the area), and I want to focus on those positives without being constantly drained by this dysfunction.\n\nThanksgiving is coming up, and I\u2019ve decided to skip it this year to give myself space. I plan to send her a message explaining my decision while setting some boundaries, but I feel guilty because she\u2019s dealing with real medical issues, and I know her life has been hard. At the same time, I can\u2019t keep putting myself in these emotionally draining situations.\n\nSo, AITA for stepping back and skipping Thanksgiving with my mom?",
