      "selftext": "Hello all, I (28F) have been with my husband (M30) for almost 5 (married2.5) years. \n\nIn the first two years of us dating we were both having fun, going out together and our friend groups, having a great time. He is in the service, so when his contract came up in Kansas, and his new one was in Europe, we decided we were going to try out the distance for a little while and then get married if it worked out. \n\nIt was almost over a year and a half of dating, and making it through some tough things together. He never gave up, and neither did I so I had really high hopes that this would be a good thing. He seemed really genuine, cared, paid lots of attention to me, and worked hard, It all was something that anyone would see as a good thing. The only thing that we had left to master was our own finances as we both seemed to be struggling with money, but with love and choosing each other, we could get through anything. \n\nLong backstory short, after marrying him, I found out that he struggled with finances REALLY badly. This was not found out truthfully till after marriage. After asking that I have access to his accounts so we could get our crap together he allowed us to share passwords to our banks. Thankfully, it was not in the 50K+ debt kind of bad that he was in, but the bad that every single dollar would be gone in his bank account and he had begun to get cash advances to try to \"give himself\" more money. (EDIT- This has since been corrected and no more advances happen.)\n\nMost of the spending was on.. LITERALLY buying food and snacks. At least $1600 of his leftover money after bills was just.. thrown out on takeout and gas stations. Upon furthur inspection I quickly saw that he also hid a good sum of money from me too. \n\nHe was military, so with him being stationed in Europe, and myself staying back in Kansas, we were able to get a housing allowance. Which was a certain amount that was given to us depending on our location. \n\nShortly after getting married, he submitted paperwork at the beginning of the month. WITHIN THE NEXT CHECK, housing was added. He told me nothing. For three pay checks, it totalled to be at least 6k with his regular income.. And it was ALL. GONE.\n\n I was also bad with money when we were dating, but after that frontal lobe developed at 25, and getting married, I was doing lots of things before and in the meantime to fix my situation. Doordashing, instacarting, everything on top of my full time plus job. I didn't want to be that wife that is awful with money. I wanted to be able to contribute. I have goals, and he did too. So it definitely made me PANIC seeing that he has been this way as far back as the statements could go. Why was he allowing me to be struggling with figuring out my stuff when he could have sent me the amount of the housing that we agreed upon? None of that money went to extra payments on anything, paying anything off... it was just.. all spent on again.. Food and gas station snacks and random stuff.\n\nAfter telling him how much he was literally pissing down his own leg, and for leaving me to struggle, I had to take control of the finances. I had tried to let him run a budget on his own, but he immediately could not do it. It was all gone again and again.  I had to take over, or leave. I had to argue and pretty much threaten him that I wasn't going to live like this if he wanted to have me around. He did agree he had a problem, so he eventually let me have control. \n\n I literally had to give him a set allowance, and I kept his money in my account safe. I paid all the bills, and threw as much as I could into the savings account. I accomplished a LOT quickly. I saved over 4k in a few months, paid off his phone, and was MONTHS ahead on insurance, and the phone bills. I even got his credit score up 130+ points. It was so bad that he couldn't have even used his Military VA loan it was so low when I got to dealing with the finances. It was becoming amazing. He had enough to screw off on or spend what he wanted, and even save if he felt like it, but I also accounted for if he didn't and kept up the slack. (spoiler, he didn't) \n\nSo here we are now. Two years later. We have been here in Europe, I finally got a full time job that is paying me pretty decent, we have been paying off Credit cards. I got his half of things totally gone. We have been taking small trips here and there to see countries and experiences. \n\nHe was totally debt free two months ago. All we had to do was just save..\n\nHe is now back in the states for school and I am in Europe now. The school is a trade school so it is only a couple of months then he comes back, and we begin to \"Clear\" to go back to the US.\n\n I had moved over here to be with him so that things were better between us relationship wise and financially. Not to mention the fact that I could live in Europe for a few years! \n\nIt cost a lot of money to get out here. So our savings have been put on hold. (0$) I got really stressed and tired with dealing with household and finances and a full time job so I agreed to let him be the one to save now since it had been some time, and things were improving. They \"did\".. except for now that he is back in the states, he has begun his spending frenzy and now, worse than before. Within two months, he applied for a bunch of credit cards, and has now racked up almost 3k in debt, and maybe 200$ in savings. He Had Hundreds in the account.\n\nWithin these purchases, he has purchased firearms, fast food, clothes, travel tickets to see family (that one is excused) but finally, STEROIDS. He does not \"know\" I know about. The firearms and Steroids were both not something that I was consulted in or ran by before he did this.\n\nHe had mentioned in passing him and his buddy were going to go look, but nothing about spending $800 on a few.  I had to see the transaction of the firearms and then confront him about it. He did not see the issue with this. \n\nWe have been arguing this whole last three months about it and the other friviolous purchases along with him hardly communicating with me. The Cup Is EMPTY.  He told me to be patient and little by little we will reach our goals. MO\\*\\*\\*\\*F\\*\\*\\*\\*R!!!!!  I sent you off debt free.. you could have been saving this whole time for the house that you are wanting and the future you say you so desperately want. Instead he is telling me that we are going to live with his mother for a few months and then we will be back on our feet...  He can't take the firearms back to Europe with him. It's Illegal. \n\nHe has been awful with communication. Hardly texts, and continues to gain weight (seeing from family pictures), and do whatever he wants. While I am trying to figure out what he means by ME be patient when we move back there in a short three or four months, and he just couldn't wait to do these things.. he had to do them... NOW?! \n\nMy one of my many final straws is the Steroids. He told me to stop only talking to him about the money, that he knows, and that he has it under control. I have literally stopped. Completely. I try to talk to him about anything but my concerns, I text, I don't, I wait, I respond when he texts, but the communication is literally nothing except for \"Hey Babe\" and \"WYD\" then nothing till the next day.\n\n If I do get a phone call he's always with someone and it feels like I am just sitting on the phone with him while he's chatting up with anyone else but me, or he isn't listening to me and definitely is on his phone while talking, or on some game of some kind. I explain to him about this issue too (which has been an in person struggle in our home life as well), but I am met with defensiveness, \"Confusion\", and shut down. I also get rebuttals about anything but what I am talking about.  It turned into a HUGE argument and us screaming at each other. He wanted me to stop.. so stop I did. Completely. I waited.. and waited. I was met with silence. (EDIT- he is a happy guy. He is 98% happy at all times just to add. But it\u2019s just like a \u201cworry about it when its DIRE\u201d. I cant tell if it\u2019s like on purpose or he literally cannot think ahead or just literally doesn\u2019t wanna deal with stuff.) \n\nThen after me \"stopping\" I saw a 600$ \"Health\" transaction. I had later checked the email, and saw an itemised bill from a site purchased on the internet with a list of things. This included: syringes, needles, and the products called, Testosterone Cypionate, Anastrozole, Enciomiphene Citrate. All of these things, from my understanding are for raising testosterone, sex drive, and..sperm count???  We are not trying for kids. I have a IUD. But suddenly, now he is pestering me about them. (I think because he is now currently on these medications)\n\nI don't want to have kids (not really at all, which he KNEW before marrying me), or even BEGIN to EVEN think of them at all till we have our own place, have a decent savings, and doing more things emotionally to make me know that he IS going to be responsible. He has shown me every time, that when I am not there, he will do what he wants and figure it out later. \n\nI feel completely held back, I feel like I am the only one worried about our future and plans, and all he can see is relying on these military loans. I DONT WANT TO BE LIVING OFF LOANS. We don't even have too. But he said that he is too old to be renting and that he is not doing that again and that he will have a house.. (but we're going to live with..mom????) I have blatantly told him how I feel, nicely, healthily, and even YELLING. I am just met with dismissal and the comment \"little by little\" and \"this is only temporary\".\n\nSo,  \nAITA for wanting to just call it quits when we get home? Im fed up with his \u201chappy-go-lucky\u201d laid back attitude. I am tired, don't feel heard, and frankly, I feel held back and not listened too at all so what is the point of it all?\n\n",
