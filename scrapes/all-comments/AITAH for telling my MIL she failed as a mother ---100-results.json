      "selftext": "35F. My husband Nate (36M) and I have two baby girls together (6F and 4F).\n\nI met Nate in college and have been with him ever since I was twenty. My husband prides himself on being \u201cstrong\u201d and won\u2019t talk about his feelings unless I pry. He\u2019s very protective of me and our girls and likes to take care of us in whatever ways he can. \n\nWhen I was in middle school, I was molested by my dad\u2019s friend. I\u2019m not ashamed, but it\u2019s also something I\u2019ve only spoken about with a few close friends and my family. I opened up to Nate about what happened to me after we\u2019d been dating for around two years, and I remember he had a very strong emotional reaction to learning about my abuse. He got teary (it was the first time I\u2019d seen him cry) and told me he wanted to kill the guy. He also told me that he understood how hard that was for me and so he\u2019s determined to make sure nothing like that ever happens to me again. I asked what he meant, but he wouldn\u2019t elaborate any further. I always had this comment in the back of my mind, but I didn\u2019t want to push him into telling me about something he wasn\u2019t ready to talk about.\n\nThe year we got engaged, we spent Christmas with his family. My MIL and I both had way too much to drink and were sitting and talking in the living room. Out of the blue, my MIL asked me if Nate told me what happened to him when he was little. I said no, and she started crying and telling me that someone hurt him very badly and I needed to talk to him about it.\n\nNate was rightfully furious when he heard this. He said that he was over what happened and didn\u2019t want to worry me unnecessarily. I told him that he didn\u2019t need to share anything, but I\u2019d selfishly like to know what his mom was talking about so I could support him. He said he didn\u2019t need support, but told me that he was molested and raped when he was in second grade. I told him I was so sorry and that I was there if he ever wanted to talk to someone about it. Nate told me that he doesn\u2019t like to talk about what happened because it sounds worse than it was and that he doesn\u2019t like to upset people unnecessarily. We\u2019ve talked about what happened to him twice since, but he really is resistant to letting me support him or acknowledging that it hurt him in any way. He also always tells me that what happened to him wasn\u2019t as serious as what happened to me because it\u2019s different for guys, which I obviously don\u2019t agree with. \n\nMy MIL is an entirely different story. On several occasions (usually after drinking), she\u2019s raised the assault with me. She\u2019s shared a lot with me, including some of the more personal details about the abuse and the fact that he was withdrawn and had night terrors for years after it happened. She\u2019s asked me if the abuse still impacts him, specifically, if he has nightmares or has trouble enjoying sex. I was very uncomfortable with these questions, but always said I hadn\u2019t noticed anything. \n\nI admittedly let this gone for longer than I should have because I had conflicting feelings about what I should do in this situation. On one hand, I know this was difficult for my MIL, and I wanted to support her in whatever way I could. On the other, I felt strange about the fact that I knew more about the situation than my husband realized and felt that my MIL\u2019s sharing sessions were a major violation of his privacy. \n\nI finally worked up the courage to tell my MIL that I\u2019m glad she trusts me with this information, but I feel guilty hearing about the situation from anyone other than my husband. I explained that he\u2019s very private about it, and I feel like these conversations are an invasion of his privacy. My MIL got teary and said Nate\u2019s just ashamed and doesn\u2019t feel comfortable talking about it because he\u2019s a man and doesn\u2019t want to be perceived as weak, especially by me. I told her I don\u2019t necessarily disagree, but I want him to have control over the situation and what he shares with me. My MIL, to her credit, seemed to understand and stopped talking about the abuse with me.\n\nLast weekend, my oldest daughter had a sleepover with her grandparents. The night we picked her up, she started crying when I was getting her ready for bed. She told me that her grandmother told her that someone hurt her daddy when he was little and that it made him very sad. My MIL told her that the person touched his private parts and said that some adults who seem nice are bad and want to hurt kids. My daughter expressed fear that someone may hurt her, and is even more upset about the fact that someone hurt her dad. I told my daughter that her dad is safe and happy now, and that the things that happened in the past aren\u2019t for her to worry about. I calmed her down, but my daughter is still scared, sad, and confused about the situation.\n\nWhen I told my husband what happened, he was devastated. He told me that he doesn\u2019t want her to worry about him and that he wants to be \u201cstrong\u201d for our little girls. I told him that we all know he\u2019s strong and he has nothing to be embarrassed about, but my husband kept saying that his mom humiliated him by sharing this with me and our child. I asked how he wanted to handle his mother, and he he was too overwhelmed to even think about it.\n\nYesterday, my MIL called about getting together with the kids again soon. I immediately asked why she thought it was appropriate to share deeply personal information about Nate with my six year old. My MIL said that my daughter needs to know that bad things can happen to kids and how to keep herself safe. I said that not only is it my job to teach her those things, but also, I can teach her to set boundaries and communicate with me without sharing her dad\u2019s trauma. I said that not only is my child afraid and sad, but my husband is embarrassed that his daughter knows about his assault. \n\nMy MIL then said I was feeding into his embarrassment by repeatedly suggesting it\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be shared with me or my daughters. She said that I\u2019m validating his fears that he has something to be ashamed of and that he\u2019s less of a man by encouraging the secrecy. I told her that I\u2019m not doing anything aside from letting him take the lead on what he wants to share and not taking to others about his trauma. She started crying and said I was failing as a wife by not encouraging him to talk about the abuse and insisting he go to therapy. She also said I\u2019m failing as a mother by not educating my daughter and leaving her vulnerable to predators.\n\nI\u2019m not proud of this, but I completely snapped. I told my MIL that maybe the reason he doesn\u2019t talk about the abuse is because she falls apart anytime the subject comes up. I said that the few times he\u2019s opened up about the abuse, he\u2019s too busy convincing me he\u2019s fine to let me comfort him or let himself process his feelings. I said I blame her for this impulse since he\u2019s had to be \u201cstrong\u201d for her so she doesn\u2019t lose it for his entire life. I also told her that she\u2019s failing as a grandmother by repeatedly violating her son and daughter-in-law\u2019s boundaries and teaching her grandkids that\u2019s okay.\n\nMy MIL said I have no idea what it\u2019s like when your child is hurt in the worst way possible and says she sincerely hopes I never have to experience that. She then said it\u2019s even worse to be the mother than a victim and that I have zero empathy for her. I said she was making it difficult to sympathize with her and hung up the phone.\n\nI do feel badly that I said she failed as a mom and a grandma even though she started it. I know it\u2019s a sensitive topic and I could have handled it better, but also, I was so angry. I told my husband what happened, but he\u2019s reached his emotional capacity at this point. I told him I\u2019d fix it and am considering apologizing to my MIL just to take the stress off of him. Aitah for how I handled the situation? I\u2019d appreciate any advice.",

Her mom made her believe she was sick and disabled for years, just to get money and attention from other people. It went so bad she killed her mom. </p>\n\n<p>That&#39;s the most EXTREME case of course, but a &quot;softer&quot; one I remember feels like your husband. It was a girl who had no health issues, but her mom got in her head that she had something with her kidneys. For YEARS she took her to every doc to get the kidney checked, beated her to make the kidney malfunction, it got so bad one got taken out and the other was only saved because a surgeon connected the dots and called CPS. The mother wasn&#39;t even really aware, she went nuts because she thought 100% legit her girl would die. </p>\n\n<p>In her case, it&#39;s a non existing kidney issue. In your&#39;s, it can be your husband past SA. Telling everyone how to deal with this trauma feels like she feels valued as the fighting mother who &quot;leads&quot; the pack. She wants to show you the example on how to behave.</p>\n</div>",

It&#39;s too late now. Have a conversation with them about how hurt people hurt people. How you can recognize how people will can hurt them.   Teach them about good touch and bad touch. What is a safe person VS a non safe person to confide in.  Let them know that no matter what happens they can always come to you to let you know you will always be there for them to keep them SAFE regardless of what stupid choices they have made. </p>\n\n<p>The most important part about keeping a child safe from predators is letting them know they are not isolated.  Predators will tell them they will be in trouble if anyone finds out. They will be taken away from their families and safe places. They will be the ones in &quot;trouble if they tell anyone&quot;</p>\n</div>",

My mother was horrified, apologized to the young lady, and when we got off the ride I got chastised about racism. I remember not having the words to explain and my mother not giving me a chance to explain, but the reason I hadn't talked was that the young lady was a stranger, and I had been taught not to talk to strangers.\n\nA few years later (when I was six) we moved to a house that had a neighbor who was an old man. My mother encouraged me to talk with him, and since she did too I knew he wasn't a stranger so I did. Decades later I learned that he was regularly raping my best friend - whose mother also encouraged him to talk to the guy.",

Until she acknowledges that what she did was absolutely 100% wrong and show remorse and swears to NEVER bring it up again TO ANYONE without DHs express permission, she would be persona non grata to me. You are absolutely right. She failed as a mother by flapping her jaws to anyone who would listen about his personal business. And then she failed as a grandmother by unnecessarily traumatizing her own grandchild. For NO REASON. I would be fighting mad. I don\u2019t know how you even stayed on the phone long enough to get out what you did.</p>\n</div>",

His response most likely didn\u2019t come naturally, it came from years of comforting his mother rather than his mother comforting and helping him work through his trauma, like a parent should do.

There are a ton of children\u2019s books that address how to build a child\u2019s ability to set healthy body boundaries and to protect themselves from being SA. As much as you want to protect your children from being SA, unfortunately you will not be able to protect them in all situations, so building a child\u2019s ability to say no, to tell you when they are feeling unsafe and know you will have their back in all circumstances is vital. You have done this because your daughter talked to you about it.\n\nYou have handled this whole situation with so much grace and kindness for all involved. Find someone who specialises in this as it will help your daughter to process the information she was given. Dan Siegel has a great book called The Whole Brain Child which talks about how to support children with processing scary, sad etc events and developing a narrative so your daughter can make sense of it all.\n\nAnother suggestion I have is to talk with MIL about seeking therapy herself.
