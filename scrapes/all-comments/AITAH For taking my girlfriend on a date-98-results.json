      "selftext": "First of all, I would like to make it clear that my two friends (a couple). Asked me to post this on here since they would like to hear the internet's opinion. \n\nMy friends went on a date to an *indoor horticultural attraction.* Or a fancy place with beautiful greenery. Before they went on this date me and the guy (M23) had a little talk because he wanted someone's opinion on where to go and all. He saw that the Greenery place was \"perfect\" because she loves plants and there's a restaurant in the place since it is quite far out from other places/restaurants.  I told him \"Hey man I have been there before and there are butterflies. I am just letting you know because she has a severe fear for them\" He responded with \"Well it's winter is it not? I think the butterflies would be gone\" I told him that I would not know since I had only been there during the summer. \n\nA few days had passed since we last talked and they went on their date then all of a sudden I got a call from the girl (F21) heavily venting about what happened and I could tell she was trying to hold her tears back.  \nShe told me that it was hands down one of the worst dates she has ever been to because as soon as they got in she was pretty amazed at first with all the greenery then she saw the butterflies.
