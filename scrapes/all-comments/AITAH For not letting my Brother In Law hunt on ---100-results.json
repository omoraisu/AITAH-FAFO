      "selftext": "My SIL and BIL (Wife's sister and and her husband) live with us out of necessity and I told him he can't shoot anymore deer on our property this year. BIL (disabled) has killed 3 deer this year (all very young bucks) on my property. Prior to this hunting season I asked he not shoot more than 1 buck as I would like them to mature before harvesting. The first 2 deer he shot were \"button\" bucks which I can understand being mistaken as does as BIL has very poor eye sight. The 3rd buck harvested was unmistakably a buck and he shot it knowingly, a blatant violation of my wishes. Fast forward BIL invites his brother and nephew to hunt on our property without asking my wife or I. One day I walk out my front door and these two guys are just here sighting in their bows in my front yard. They didn't kill any deer thankfully. My wife and I ask for the BIL to please ask permission prior to inviting people to hunt. BIL and SIL agree to this and ask if his other brother and nephew can hunt here on Thanksgiving. Reluctantly I agree but ask that they don't shoot any bucks, also I say if they do shoot a buck there will be no more hunting. Anyhow the Nephew shoots a buck, I am \"Salty\". A week later after the 4th buck is killed the BIL and I are talking and I remind him no more deer hunting! He replies \"but my brother is coming in January, we can shoot does right?\". Me \"No Frickin Way, you've lost your mind you should have asked me prior to inviting them!\"  Now my SIL says family comes before all and believes I am a selfish AH for saying no more hunting here.  I say the BIL thinks he is running his own personal hunting lodge out of our house and he is being dang greedy.\n\nP.S. I have no problem killing a deer for meat but 1 or 2 deer is more than enough for 2 people for a year. I only have 5 acres so 4 deer is too dang many IMHO. Don't most people have rules for others hunting on their land (genuinely curious)? Are my rules unreasonable or are the In Laws just being self serving? When I bought this house and accompanying land I wanted no deer hunting for 5 years but capitulated because the BIL is ill and may not make it much more than a few more years. I feel I have no obligation to allow everybody and their brother to fill their freezers with deer from our property. I am done with ingratitude and greed and nobody will hunt on my land again other than my wife, daughter, son or myself. Going forward I will only allow animals likely to die within a year will be harvested. I believe in harvesting only mature animals and only what one can consume. So let me have it, AITAH?\n\nTLTR: Family wants to shoot all my deer and I say 1 or 2 per year is more than enough. ",

I'll explain them in this post but for OP, his family are straight up poaching/stealing and needs to be dealt with as if they constantly emptied the fridge for food (except the damage they do here by stealing deer can take decades to fix so it's actually much worse). Either he gets his act together or he finds somewhere else to live. I'd have no problem contacting the police either if letting the entire family know that hunting is ONLY on OPs terms and with his explicit permission EVERY TIME!  If the herd gets too small because of overhunting, it'll mean fewer deer for ages until the remaining herd has grown back to a size where anyone can be spared for eating. You don't normally \"import\" deer, just maintain the natural population to a healthy size.\n\nMy family is somewhat old school and this isn't rules made by \"bleeding heart libs\" but comes from hundreds of years of hunting for survival and living in symbiosis with the land. Also, my family follows the same ethics that most hunters here in Scandinavia follow, it's not some weird, unique thing or made by ppl with religious rules regarding hunting like I can imagine inuit ppl have. These rules are mostly unwritten and not law.\n\nI'll explain what I was taught here to the non-hunters here. Rule number one is that hunting is for food and you don't shoot more than you (or the land) need, and you don't profit from selling meat. IF you have too much, you are allowed to give it away but no killing for profit.\n\nThere ARE instanses where there'll be shot more than you need for food. This only happens if the herd needs culling or if a specific deer needs to be put down for humane reasons or for the good of the herd. \"The good of the herd\" mostly meaning that if there's too many animals for all of them to have enough food, then you need to remove some. Same with illness or injured animals. And yes, most hunters with own land, even away from their house, actually know how many deer there is, how much the land can feed and can tell the deer apart. It wasn't unheard of in my family to start a hunt with saying \"we're going for this 1 deer specifically, not the rest, the rest are to be left alone\".\n\nEven in my non-religious family it was also unheard of to hunt on holy days. If there was \"gods peace\" for man, the same would be extended to beast. That meant they'd only go hunting on the third day after christmas since the christmas days were \"days off\" for the animals as well.\n\nYou also don't hunt during seasons with babies (I'm sorry, English is my second language and I don't know the hunting terms here) or when the weather is so rough that the animals have a hard time surviving already and don't have a fair chance at getting away. It went as far as my dad buying an old tractor so he could get to the forrest in heavy snow to feed the deer so they didn't starve. This was NOT to kill them at the feeding spot later on, simply, again, to maintain the herd and help them survive.\n\nWHEN you shoot, you only shoot to kill and preserve the meat. If you can get a kill shot but will ruin the meat with bullets, you don't shoot. Period. \"A good day hunting\" wasn't necessarily because they shot anything, it was having a day out in nature and only sending \"good shots\" and otherwise enjoy the view of nature and the animals they'd see.\n\nIF they injured an animal, they'd 1. call hunters with dogs to specifically locate the wounded deer and 2. Keep hunting for days until the animal was put out of its misery. You'd get soooo much shit for injuring an animal, way more than if you didn't shoot. If the meat was destroyed, you'd leave it in the woods for predators to eat. Same if the animal was so old the meat wasn't any good but they did a lot to hunt them before that happened.\n\nWe'd have big hunting dinners at my house and it was almost sacred. It was the only occasion where I'd see my dad in a tie and we were all ordered to dress up in our finest \"to honor the animal that gave its' life to feed us\". When no one wanted or needed the meat, they simply wouldn't shoot and if they had to to maintain the herd, the meat would be given away.",

I finallymanaged to explain to my dad that what he thought was something EVERYONE knew was, in fact, something he himself had never taken the time to tell me since I wasn&#39;t interested in hunting myself but accompanied him because I, like him, enjoyed spending a day in nature with all the guys and dogs. </p>\n\n<p>I knew he was ethical in how he hunted and how much of a passion he had about hating &quot;butcher hunters&quot; but I was honestly in awe of how much after he FINALLY took the time to explain it to me like I was 5 years old. Pretty much all my friends are non-hunters too and they had the same reaction when I told them what my dad had finally explained to me.</p>\n</div>",
