      "selftext": "\nIt's been 4 years since I completely ghosted my bestfriend Mike over a series of bad behaviours. 6 months ago he followed me on Instagram and I've been thinking about clearing the air. I sometimes have dreams where he features and get reminders of how my life was and what went wrong.\n\nMike approached me back in 2015 at Mansion House University (fake names), he was this buff, good-looking man that came from money and me, a working class, shy scrawny kid (both 19). At first I was thinking why is this guy talking to me? I was wary of his intentions because guys like him don't talk me but I was needlessly suspicious. We became close, I saw Mike as a social butterfly and we spent most of our time at university talking to girls (a lot of them being interested in Mike). Weirdly, he brought out a side to me that was confident and charming, enabling me to do things I couldn't do prior to meeting him - not consistently anyways. In the 8 months we studied together, I learned a lot from Mike, and he shifted my mindset for the good but I always felt there was a time limit to our friendship. \n\nWe're both Indian, but culturally we were different. I was born and brought up in the UK where as he was Indian born and brought up all over the world. Our households were different too, the way we both spoke was different and frankly he had a slight toxic side that I guess came from the money he had. Mike very much used his possessions, dad's money and his looks as a means to flex. Things that I and people I generally knew didn't. Regardless of his and my flaws, we had a great time together and I saw him as a close friend. \n\nMy time in the sun comes to an end and I moved away to study at another university and Mike stayed on at Mansion House. Both of us struggled to connect with people in our new classes and facetimed regularly to complain about university life. He even visited a few times and I made my way home to see him too. Mike mentioned an Indian girl moved in next door and was in his class. Phoebe also started featuring in some of our Facetimes and lets just say I knew where this was going. Mike, said he wasn't interested and I believed him to a degree - the kinds of girls we used to talk to, the girls interested in him were far more attractive than Phoebe. I sound shallow, but I spent that time at Mansion house talking to anybody and everybody and Phoebe never made an impression on me. \n\nLong story short, Mike hooks up with Phoebe and they become official within a month. Despite never making it known, we never liked eachother and I think it was because she may have seen me as some sort of womaniser (a lot of people did). Mike always said he was so sociable because I was, and funnily enough I said the same. Us talking to lots of girls was something of prominence, and I guess he may have shifted that light on me when he talked about me to Phoebe? He always said Phoebe was possessive. To me, she seemed like she hovered around Mike and he took advantage of who was easy. They're both Indian, culturally similar and saw each other everyday.\n\nPhoebe had issues though - Mike mentioned how she had money (way more than Mike), came from a broken house hold and she used to cut herself. Soon Mike's whole routine had changed. He'd wake up at 2pm, was always late to facetime and meeting up. It seemed my time didn't mean as much to him. Often asking me to come to his place which was nearly an hour away on the bus and a few times making me wait in the lobby for a while to only hang out there. Mike had done this enough times to piss me off. It's understandable to shift priorities but he was clearly disrespecting my time. I saw this and a series of other actions towards me and reacted appropriately. Our conversations online lagged, dwindling down to sending eachother posts about cars until we didn't. He'd reach out but I didn't respond thinking I don't need such a friend and remembered the times I was disrespected. That was until I hit a rough patch in my life. \n\nThe truth was I struggled to formulate the relationships I had once did with people at my new university. I felt I wasn't good enough to build friendships or relationships with. A date that mattered didn't work out as I wanted and the weight of it all just hit me and I needed to talk it out. Talking to my sister helped but I missed my old life, I missed Mike. I wanted to feel normal again.\n\nMike definelty enabled my true personality to come out, these characteristics were innately part of me but only really came out when I was with my friend and that's what I told him. After a year or so I just gave in and Facetimed him. I told him about everything but the issues I had with him. Communication was never easy for me so I chose to hold back from telling him how his disregard for me drove me to ghost him. It was somewhat selfish and it was partially motivated by a hunch that Phoebe would be in the back listening and analysing.\n\nHe was gracious enough to accept what I was saying but was still suspicious. Regardless, we spoke for hours and it was great. After meeting up I caught him up on my time at university. I changed my appearance drastically thinking it would be one less aspect people could reject me on. Built muscle and dressed well, making my shy and awkward self seem attractive to a lot of women. I spent most of my time sleeping around and I guess it showed mostly on Instagram. I came to terms with my bisexuality and although I was never open about it, I didn't hide it. I think that's how Mike and Phoebe came to know, probably looking into me after our Facetime. There are a lot of Bretman Rock and Nikita dragun types of IG accounts liking my posts - a flaring gun for those looking but I didn't care. My sexuality is my business and I wasn't looking to talk about it so when catching up, I didn't mention everything I got up to. Mike was suspicious though, slyly bringing up some trans women who liked my posts asking if I knew them. \n\nWe got back to some level of normality, talking about our time at Manor House University - Mike loved to reminisce. I think he envied the university experience I had. Mike was the guy girls were attracted to and I think he settled down intensely and quickly. At this point it had been 4 or 5 years since Mike and Phoebe's became official (a month after they hooked up) and he comes out with it. He said he missed our year at Manor House and wondered about the what ifs. I always respected the relationship Mike and Phoebe had and told him no you're settled, what more could he want? In reality, I knew exactly the kinds of girls he used pull, the situations that would literally just land on his lap but I wasn't going to mention them. Not after he was talking about his doubts and what ifs - it wasn't the right thing to do. But he was persistent, bringing up the same topic every time we'd meet up or a hot girl would walk by. Saying, see \"you could go for her\". \n\nHe told me he downloaded tinder when Phoebe was away one time. Given the kind of attention he used to get and the experience he feels like he lacked - I told him to go ahead and try it again. Not the best advice I could've given but every other conversation we'd have, he'd bring this up. I gave him two options where he could quietly explore options which would result in the end of his relationship or he could knuckle down and stay focused on Phoebe. For some reason to validate his decision to not cheat he sent me her nudes. I remember seeing 3 pictures followed by the message \"enjoy\" that grossed me the fuck out. I replied saying I shouldn't have seen those pictures, and told him to delete the prior messages. \n\nMike picked up on how I felt about what he did and I think that sparked some sort of insecurity in him. He started to float the idea of a threesome of all things with Phoebe, him and one of my old fwbs. A girl who I cared for to a certain degree and was half way across the country. I know my morality is something to be questioned since I gave Mike 2 options which included cheating but I would never adopt the \"you can have her now\" or \"enjoy\" mentality some guys have with ex lovers. Phoebe was a 'no go zone' type of girl, even if Mike and her weren't together, it wouldn't even cross my mind because there was a connection between them. Crossing that line would mean on some level, it would bother Mike and I didn't want that. So his proposal of dming my old fwb was the last straw. \n\nThis was a massive overstep and had to ghost. He'd call, text, and even contacted my mum a few times but I never got in touch. \n\nI've cut out a large amount of good and bad moments in our friendship simply because this post would be too long to read. Being Mike's friend and my time at university involved a lot of character building. Therapy helped to clear up my thoughts and feelings and overall I can say, I am a better person coming out of these experiences. For Redditers who want to go all out in the replies, this was 3 years ago and I can communicate like a normal person and don't recommend cheating now. I wouldn't want to be friends with Mike, we're very different people now but I believe in signs and lately Mike has been in my thoughts. Should I clear the air? ",
