      "selftext": "I want to love him but I fear inside that I am a bad resentful person because I simply cannot. We aren\u2019t very close since he was not present in my life until I was 16 after I got hospitalised for my Anorexia. Before then he was a ghost, kids that I had known for years at school thought my father was dead. For parent teacher conferences I went alone. My sports matches I went alone. At home I was alone unless he was in a screaming match with my mom after coming home drunk. The only small interactions I had with him was when he would get angry and hit me. I only knew his name, face and occupation. But I know he had a good reason, he was making money for us. I know I should be grateful because some fathers don\u2019t do that. I know I should be grateful because he built a comfortable life for me but I\u2019m greedy. \n\nHe\u2019s more present now for my sisters after he was stuck with us during covid and after my health battle but for our relationship it\u2019s not the same. I try but I can\u2019t get over the feeling of loss all of the years when he chose the bar over me. Even if I get he was probably just dealing with stress that way. I try and cover it up but I\u2019m so hatful inside and it makes me feel disgusting. How could I hate the person finding my education. I don\u2019t want to hate him, but I don\u2019t think we can have a normal relationship. The only time I\u2019ve been emotionally vulnerable in his presence was after my friend committed suicide when I was 13, I told him what happened because I had randomly started crying hysterically in the car, but the next day he made a joke about hanging himself. When I cried he said \u201cjokes are how you get over things\u201d. I want to love him and to be loved by him. But it will never feel anything more than a synthetic emotion. I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019m so privileged and yet I\u2019m ugly inside. \n\n",
