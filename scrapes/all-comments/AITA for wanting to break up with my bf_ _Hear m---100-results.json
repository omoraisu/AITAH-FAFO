      "selftext": "I know this might sound like a stupid question but I genuinely need to know, I feel so bad. So basically I recently lost feelings for my boyfriend of two months, it was going great but then I lost feelings, he did some things such as, say I 'eat way too fucking much', call me weak in front of his friends, and a few other things which I'll mention in a bit. So, a while back me and my boyfriend got together at a party after one of our mutual friends set us up. It was going great for the whole two months, until he started saying or doing things that just slowly made me lose feeling before I realized it.\n\nOne time, I had gotten extra chips because no one else wanted them, they were enough to fill a quarter of those nasty brown paper lunch bags and as we were walking away and I was munching on my food he said, and I quote, \"You eat wayyyy to fucking much.\" And idk, that just hurt, he said it again a few days later when my friend gave me some lunch, (He said it when they walked away).\n\nAnother time, we were walking and talking on a date, and I told him that I have some SH tendencies and I was trying to get better but I often relapse, and his reply to that was \"Do you not care about me?\" And that was just a major red flag. For me, at least.\n\nNext, we were having a snowball fight with a group of friends, and I was off on the side cause I got iceballed right in the eye, and since it's a snowball fight, one of my friends was going to hit me, fair game, mad respect. But my boyfriend stepped in front of me to take the hit, and y'know what he said? \"I protect the weak!\" Like? Sir? Yeah, no.\n\n(Here is some context for this next thing he did. We're in a band, I play trumpet and he plays tuba.) So, we were talking about one of our pieces, and he objectively has one of the best parts because of how funky it sounds and I agree that it sounds amazing. And, as a trumpet, I usually get the main chorus for songs, so, my part wasn't as funky but still, it was really good. And sometimes I feel like I'm overreacting about this but my friends say I'm not, but basically he said, and I quote, \"Your part sucks, it's so bad.\" And that's just...? Sir?\n\nAnother thing to mention, his love language is physical affection, and he always clings to me, and I heavily dislike physical affection, and I have told him this, multiple times. I've been SAed before and when I first did we were dating, so this was really recent, when I got SAed, he didn't care, just said I'd forget about it the next day. So... yeah.\n\nAnother thing he did was when we first started dating, he kept misgendering me and whatnot which was annoying af considering he didn't know me prior to my transition (I'm a trans guy).\n\nAnd what I think is the final thing that made me lose feelings for him is that we were in a class and it was really stressful and I was leading our group and on the verge of a panic attack, and not once did he care enough to comfort me, he just said \"You're always like this. You're fine.\" And one of our group members who I barely talk to was able to comfort me better than my bf could.\n\nAnyways, now, on to the reasons I feel bad for breaking up with him, he was cheated on before and was really depressed. He always tells me I'm the reason he's not depressed, which is... uh... something, and like, I guess he's not really meaning to do all of that but still. I'm going to break up with him tomorrow and I just wanna know if I'll be an asshole for doing so.\n\nHe's a good guy and I don't want him to be depressed, I struggle with depression and it's absolute horse shit. I wanna end things on good terms and still be friends but I don't know if he'll want that, even worse is that I have more than half my classes with him.",
