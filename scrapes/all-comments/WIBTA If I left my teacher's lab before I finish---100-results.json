      "selftext": "I (25M) am a college student and I work as a student researcher and my teacher/supervisor (60F) has been increasingly telling me things that make me very uncomfortable. A lot over texts but most of these things are said alone in person or on calls. She keeps telling me \u201cI love you.\u201d I do not feel this way about her and I\u2019ve never said this to her. I always am silent when she says it because I fear retaliation from her if I were to say no. Especially because she has talked to me in private about people who \u201cwronged\u201d her years ago and it makes me feel like she wouldn\u2019t hesitate to do something to me or my career if I were to openly object to her comments. On top of that she will talk ill of me in private by criticizing my skills but never offering insight on how to improve when I ask or yell at me over the phone sometimes about issues that have nothing to do with work or me (yet she finds a way to take stress out on me), while simultaneously telling everyone in our department how great I am when we are in public.\n\nI reported her behavior to the Dean and they held a meeting with her and I assumed that her behavior would stop. For a couple weeks it did and then she went back to the old behaviors. I\u2019m hesitant to leave because I\u2019m worried that by leaving her lab while I have two unfinished manuscripts means that this would look very badly on me. That I would be seen as the AH. I do not plan to be sharing her behaviors in a formal report at this time nor do I want to talk about it around the department so I wouldn't have much of a defense for why I am leaving. Other labs have already told me they don\u2019t want to upset her and would need permission from her for me to work in their lab. I feel like there\u2019s a chance that if I quit that I will be seen as irresponsible, poor work ethic, and an AH for not finishing the work expected of me. Fortunately the two papers dont have many authors on it. It's myself, my supervisor, and another faculty at this time. So it's not a situation where an incomplete paper means a detriment to another student. But I know leaving unfinished work can be seen as an AH move, so it's hard for me to imagine not being looked at as the AH by the rest of the department, or others students that don't know me well, for just up and leaving her lab. So WIBTA for leaving now?\n\n  \nTLDR: My supervisor/teacher is telling me things that make want to leave their lab but I'm worried that leaving now will make me look like an AH.",
