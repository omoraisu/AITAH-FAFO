      "selftext": "1.5 years ago my significant other (M32) and myself (F32) went through a rough patch and I decided we should separate. We share a child  (M7) and a house. He wanted to keep the house which was fine because I wanted my son to still have his home. I needed to start over on my own so I needed him to buy me out. He initially wanted to take over payments and keep me on the mortgage. That wasn\u2019t going to work because I needed to get a place of my own and didn\u2019t want my credit tied up into that property. We sat down with his mom to discuss options on how to proceed with the split. For a little background, he is a mommas boy and she is aware of his business from his perceptive. His parents are wealthy and at one point it was shared to me that they were interested in buying our house from us and putting it in their trust for us to live in it eventually. This idea never sat well with me, because I don\u2019t like to feel like I owe someone something and I didn\u2019t want to worry about being asked to leave for whatever reason and no say. Let\u2019s just say that this conversation about us splitting didn\u2019t go well when it was brought up if it would be a possibility for them to be interested in doing that for their son and grandson and buy the home them since my sons father doesn\u2019t have the credit to buy me out himself. In no way was I telling her what to do, we were simply discussing options. His mother got offended, said a few words that were not so nice and asked for me to return an engagement ring her son had given me. Conversation ended. The tension escalated between myself and him/his mother as expected with divided property and assets. I lawyered up because I wanted someone in my corner against him/his parents/his parents lawyer. She has called me a disgusting human being amongst other things, criticized my parenting and tried to tell me what I can post on my social media. I blocked her. In the end, she bought the house exactly how I guessed it would happen and I got bought out of my half. My significant other and myself have since reconciled, had a baby, and got married. He tried to get me to move back into the house his parents purchased but like hell that would happen. We have since moved into a new home and his parents remodeled and moved his sister into our old home. There is still bad blood between myself and his mother but agree to disagree for the sake of the grandkids. However, I chose to still have a boundary and keep her blocked on social media. My now husband has asked me to unblock her so that she can see pictures of the kids that he is tagged in, saying that it will cause problems between us if I don\u2019t. He personally doesn\u2019t share family pictures on social media because he says that those who are close to us are present and he doesn\u2019t need to. I am thinking that it is because I am the one sharing enough so he doesn\u2019t have to. I\u2019m set on keeping her blocked for personal reasons and told him to post the pictures himself or send them directly to her. I feel like he doesn\u2019t respect my boundaries and crossing the line for the sake of making his life easier dealing with his mother. AITAH",
