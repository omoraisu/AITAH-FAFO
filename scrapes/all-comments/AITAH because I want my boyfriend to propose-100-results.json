      "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been together for almost 4 years, (F33, M34) we are young professionals and have no children. The past 4 years have been wonderful. We have grown in our careers and cheered one another one in our success. We complement each other so well and I just know he is my person. \n\nLast christmas I thought he was going to propose... Christmas is my favorite time of the year, our home is beautiful, its snowing outside its just perfect. We were opening gifts just the two of us (we already spent time with both sides of the family) last year, had the fireplace on and just enjoying the season and he says\" I think Santa left you something else...\" he goes to the guest bedroom and come out with one last gift. It was large but maybe just maybe this was going to be the moment he pops the question. It was not a ring, it was a pair for shoes. I was devastated that I even assumed that. I felt humiliated. \n\nAfter new years I sat him down and explained from my perspective how I perceived the gift. He completely understand and apologized. \n\nWe have talked about a ring, what we like, dont like, we have talked about a weeding, or getting eloped, I have focused on wanting to know what does he want because a wedding is the joining of two people, not just what I want. We have had some fantastic conversation about what we both want and have narrowed it down to two options. \n\nWe have even looked at rings, and I found the one that is perfect. \n\nFast forward to this year... I know for a fact he has not purchased many gifts as im the one getting them off the front porch and leaving anything addressed to him in his office. So my mind begins to wonder will he actually propose this year!? Then reality sets in and says no, he has this imaginary number in his head that he wants in his bank account and wants a job promotion before he proposes. Which is fine we have conquered paying off debt and saving for things and im happy to help him with this but I feel like he is making excuses. Which makes me feel like he dosent see value in this relationship. \n\nI am a very much if he wanted he would... and it is getting to the point where this is embarrassing. We are a older couple, corporate professionals, no children... I feel like he is questioning this relationship... which we are 4 years in... \n\nFor context we talked about marriage very ealry on in our relationship. I also set the president that im not dating to date/hook up im dating to find someone who wants to get married and do life together. \n\nFor some reason I thought maybe this year, we have conquered some financial goals, grown closer but no...He askes me \"I dont really know what you want for Christmas... how about I buy you a new garage refrigerator...\" To that I said no thank you, I would prefer a engagement ring. \n\nWhy would he want to buy me a garage refrigerator but not a engagement ring. Then when I say I would prefer a engagement ring he acts shocked like this is news to him. \n\nNow he dosent put alot of effort into gifts, he puts his efforts in other areas of our lives. I adore gift giving and try my hardest to find special gifts that you would never buy nor know you needed till I got them for you. \n\nI was crushed when he made that comment. It reminded me he dosent think about our future and what am I doing. I am with a man, playing house with someone who will not propose. \n\nFor context I am not even asking for a dimond (thats another discussion, it has to do with ethics for me) The ring we picked out we could pay cash for and that was intentionally done because I dont need a big flashy, expensive ring. \n\nAITAH for being hurt that he wanted to get me a refrigerator and that I want to marry this man yet year after year I mitigate questions from my family and his \"why has he not proposed yet....\" it makes me feel like  he is not prioritizing saving money for the ring, because anytime I bring it up he is shocked I feel this way. \n\nHelp and advice welome\n\n",

He will keep moving the goal posts until you just lose hope and accept the status quo. \n\nI know this isn't a popular opinion but IMHO people who are genuinely \"dating to marry\" shouldn't move in together (or buy property) until there's a formal engagement and a ballpark (mutually agreed upon) timeline for marriage.  For example-- Engaged with a timeline to be married after grad school, or after accumulating a down payment for a house, or just a specific number of years.",
