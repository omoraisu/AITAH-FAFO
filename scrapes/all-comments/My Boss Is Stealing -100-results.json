It hasn\u2019t caught up to her yet because the owner is practically senile and the inventory process is completely manual on paper. The zinger is that my boss is also a family member. She has been at the store for years and it feels like a major betrayal. I know I need to do something but feel conflicted. Should I go to the police? Or tell the owner first? Christmas is about to get real awkward.",

That might at least get the account to audit the sales, etc, find something and then look at the security footage.</p>\n\n<p>Whistleblowers do not get a fair shake in my experience, so I would prefer to quit rather then speak up directly.  Hopefully some of the indirect approaches above can give you some ideas.</p>\n</div>",
