      "selftext": "Last year, my neighbour asked if he could use my outlet to plug one side of his lights. \n\nI didn\u2019t know and said, \u201clet me ask my wife\u201d\nshe does all the lighting. \n\nI didn\u2019t hear back from my wife (maybe I forgot to ask), but they had rejigged our lights to plug in theirs. We decided to just let it slide\u2026Christmas spirit and all. \n\nThey do have an outlet at the front of their house. They\u2019d need to use an extension cord to run lights to the other side\u2026 essentially you need a cord to run under your door mat. This is how we\u2019ve done it. \n\n\u2014\u2014\nSo now, this year, without asking, they plugged their lights in. \n\nWe rejigged our lights to use all the outlets and left their Christmas lights (just the ones on the right side of the house) unplugged and dangling. \n\nSo, thought I\u2019d get the opinion here. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014UPDATE\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThank you all for the great community. I appreciate the support. The neighbours ended up wiring their own extension cord in the end. No conversation or confrontation needed. I really liked @lethalghost \u2018s idea to gift them an extension cord. Thank you!!",
