      "selftext": "I 26f am in a relationship with my 36m for almost a year and I need advice.\n\nContext \nI come from physically & emotional abusive  relationships where I never felt safe, valued, love, respect or affection physical and emotional and intercourse was never enjoyable to me until my partner. I had nightmares sleeping next to these men I was in relationships with, this man..he was the complete opposite.\nVery physically affectionate like I couldn't even cook without him wanting to hug me and now nothing.. I found out why and I need advice..\n(I admit I was dumb staying in those situations but it's life and I believe I've grown.)\n\nI worked 3 jobs originally total of (90/100 hours) this is while we were just talking and starting the relationship \n\nA\u2022 Monday, Wednesday and Friday was one job a total of 12 hours \n\nB\u2022 Tuesday to Friday I could work a total 40 to 70 hours. \n\nC\u2022 Tuesday,Thursday,Friday and Saturdays at another for a max of 30 hours \n \nWhen we started officially dating he made it clear he wasn't comfortable with one of these jobs and out of respect I let it go.. it was the one with most hours and also sadly the most pay so my finances took a heavy hit.\n\nI grew stressed my weight fluctuated and i worked very hard to get the body i have now.(400 lbs to 140) \nEven with that job gone i still took Uber's to and from his place total of almost 180$ every weekend and in our almost exactly 12 month relationship he's picked me up probably 8 times and even after we spoke on it and he said he'd pick me up sometimes..\nIt hasn't changed (been 4 months). \nOne of the other jobs refused my pay increase so I went & looked for another job, during that time again I got stressed and vented alot to my bf. I didn't know at the time but I annoyed him enough for him to go on his boys chat and tell me about how I'm complaining all the time. I was hurt when I saw the text, he saw I was hurt too and apologized and it was never about him venting to them it's the fact I annoyed him enough to tell other people about  it. Had nothing to do with him but me feeling bad, I disrupted his peace and those of his friends. I put it all to the side but didn't notice that he started distancing himself from then.\n\nFew weeks after another broken promise of him picking me up or even dropping me off I grew annoyed especially when he cracked a beer at 8am after swearing he would take me home.. again.. I had given up a job for him my finances were hit and with barely enough money for my 800$ rent I was stuck. He knew this, it sucked cause I had to borrow money not only from him but my family as well so I could maintain our relationship cause he wouldn't make the effort to come get me.\n\nI'm the type of girlfriend who won't ask for anything from their boyfriends if I know they don't want to do something but as I don't ask often the few times I do I would've hoped he'd make the effort for me. I cook for him almost every weekend, when I get to his house Saturday after ive worked I'll do his bed clean dishes in the sink be it his or the person he lives with, I often help clean his clothes from the washer. Basically I help him out cause he does do it himself. (We don't live together) \n\nAfter a while I got a job, left the one that denied my pay raise and then it started going okay again, new job accused me of stealing after 2 and a half months due to inventory issues and i had some things that the inventory was missing lost the job and now it was worse cause i had the job that paid the least and almost no hours so im back to being stressed and loosing money nonstop cause he wont pick me up but would rather put money we need to safe to move in together on the Uber instead of making an effort...still let it go.\nHis back was hurting so there still wasn't any sexual activity but I understood why.\nOctober comes around and it's my nephews birthday, I asked him to come to the party even for two hours and I'd pay his Uber he said yes..guess who didn't come and instead of calling me to tell me, he texted me and then called to ask if I was mad..the day of he basically ditched me..my own bf \n\nWe got into a fight and I brought up how im hurt i disrupted his peace and how he doesnt keep his word and it's hurting cause I'm feeling used and pushed aside. Again we haven't had actual sex at that point in a while and he keeps forgetting to kiss me and hug me. But at 3am he has no issue waking me up to give him a hjob and a Bjob. \n\nHe apologized for speaking to his friends and saying I complained when that wasn't the issue i just felt bad i disturbed his peace.\nHe said he'd try to do better\nStill a month & a half has passed, he still hasn't picked me up or dropped me off after promising me (since October were now in december still nothing) \n\nI had been planning on getting a boob job and a butt job he knows and has commented how he likes big boobs and a big butt..he even accidentally sent me a video of girls with a huge rack and it was \"supposed to be for his boy\" but still..why do you have that on your feed if you haven't like it before or something simillar?\n I have a B cup..and I have no butt.. so that makes me feel more insecure. He called me and asked \"when you get it done what are you planning on the size\" I replied a c or d I want fake but still natural. His reply was \"get a d so I have something to actually grab\". I replied \"not like you grab anything  now\" (i get it was petty but im frustrated & lonely in a relationship i dont get that when it wasnt like this) I got sad and insecure, my safe space makes me feel insecure. \nDuring our fight he told me clearly, the reason he hasn't touched me is cause I'm complaining and bitching and it's unpleasant so I have to be pleasant to have him love me.\n\nI feel used cause he's been unhappy these last months yet again will wake me up at 3 am for his sexual gratification. He even said I'm like his ex cause there always something, how can I be pleasant when you don't keep your promises. He gets stressed easy and I'm always there, when I am. I feel like I have to be alone cause it becomes about him and his feelings but he doesn't seem to care for mine \nI'm hurt \nMy safe space is gone and it seems like my person too. I feel like a place holder until he gets something better and it's not fair.\n\nWhat can I do? ",

Did his reason have any sound basis in logic? What do you mean out of \"respect\"? I don't get it, what is he your Don? Your mafia father? Respect for his logic and the impact of the job on the two of you individually and as a couple? Or out of respect for \"he wants it and I'm in a relationship so I should give it to him\"?\n\nIf the roles were reversed, would you be asking someone you just started dating to give up their largest source of income and the largest time sink of their live, and have a reasonable expectation that they would do so out of \"respect\"?\n\n>Few weeks after another broken promise of him picking me up or even dropping me off\n\nI don't get it. Why are you still with him without a major problem like this being resolved? Reciprocity is important to you. The lack of it is a financial issue and otherwise a major problem to you. So why is it still up in the air? Either he picks you up or you do not see him.\n\n>I feel used cause\n\nYou ARE being used. He just wants you for sex, without any of the trouble that comes from him being a man. Ditch him already!\n\nYou haven't named even one positive thing about him, other than the fact that he has you so sick that you lost weight. NTA.",
