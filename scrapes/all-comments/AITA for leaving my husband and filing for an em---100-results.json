      "selftext": "My husband and I (both 30s) married 5 years ago. Together we have a 3.5 year old son and he has an 11 year old daughter and a 9 year old son with his ex. Things with the ex were strained. She had three other children with a former partner who are 8, 7 and 6. My husband's ex died a year ago. For us it was sudden but she knew she was sick, she'd told the kids she was sick, and had told my stepkids not to tell us. Her former partner wasn't in the lives of the children they shared and none of her family stepped forward so my husband signed us up to take his ex's three children... without discussing it with me.\n\nThis was an issue for me. We argued about it and ended up talking about it a lot. I tried to work through it to not cause more upheaval for my stepkids or to pull my son's family apart.\n\nBut the mother's death changed my stepkids. They were bitter toward me and hateful toward their younger brother and their younger siblings have also been incredibly hateful toward us both and there were dangerous things happening. My husband carried on working and left me to do most of the parenting and he knew that would be the case before this. The case worker we had was helping with resources for therapy and grief support groups but I had to document several incidents where one of the kids tried to harm my son, there were open threats made to harm him also. My husband would help me when he was home but it was mostly still me alone with them. My stepdaughter told me a couple of months ago that her mom had hated me and they (she and her brother) used to love me but their mom knew I was bad and she raised her other kids to hate me. My stepdaughter also said her mom told her that my son was never their brother and they should never consider him equal to her kids. She said this to the case worker too.\n\nThe bio father of the other kids started paying child support but money isn't what I needed.\n\nIt reached a point where I could not leave my son out of my sight. My husband wouldn't do more and he argued when I said I was going to express to the case worker that having the other three kids was too much. He told me I'd make things worse if I did that and my stepkids would never forgive me or my son.\n\nSo I spoke to the case worker, got her report and I left my husband and filed for an emergency custody hearing and with the proof from the case worker I have temporary physical custody. My husband cannot see our son and I am working out the divorce.\n\nOf course he's angry and he told me I should have talked to him more first. But our son's safety is my #1 concern while he's worried my stepkids will hate him for separating them from the other three. His parents, who I always got along with, are also angry and they told me it was a sleezy way I handled myself. They said this even though they witnessed the harm my son was at risk of.\n\nI hate that it reached this point but I couldn't keep my son in that house anymore.\n\nBut AITA for my actions?",

I bet that your (ex) is husband is now expecting his parents to do all the work for those kids, the work that he expected you to do. So they want you to come back, so that they aren&#39;t expected to be responsible for the kids anymore. I&#39;d put money on your husband still refusing to take responsibility for those kids, and be pushing them on anyone he can I.e. His parents. So they resent you now, because you&#39;ve gotten away from this nonsense and they haven&#39;t</p>\n</div>",
