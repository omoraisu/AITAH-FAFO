      "selftext": "\nFake names obviously \n\nI (22f) have been a chef for years and I started the job I\u2019m at two years ago. There I met Kelly (26f) and Ben (31m) as Ben was my head chef and Kelly worked on the bar.\nWhile I was there I became close with Kelly as she became pregnant late 2022 and turns out we are very similar people.\n \nSome background on the two as a couple , Ben has been to jail and some bad things .(which Kelly stuck with him through out) but when he got out, he got a normal job and tried to live a normal life , neither of them lived in the city I live in and they both moved here so Ben can do the chef job (they basically left everything to come here )\nBen ended up leaving the chef job and getting something else with more money \n\nBut the whole situation is I was at home last Friday and I missed a called from one of my closest friends lia (23)\nas I was asleep , I call her back the next day and didn\u2019t get an answer so I phone my other best friend holly (21)\nShe FaceTimed me and asked me if Ben was single (as she\u2019s been in my work and spoke to him a couple times) I then said no because I knew he was still with Kelly \nTurns out he slept with lia and she didn\u2019t know they were still together as Ben told her they\u2019d been broken up for weeks\u2026 I told her no they are still together from what I know as Kelly mentioned to me the night before they they were going on a family day out the next day \n\nSo skip to Tuesday when I\u2019m next on work and Kelly is in and you can tell she\u2019s been crying , I grab her for a chat and ask her if she wants to talk and she tells me about how her and Ben got into an argument on Saturday because Ben didn\u2019t come home from his work night out until 12pm and how he was blaming her and saying she\u2019s driving him out and that it\u2019s not the same anymore \n\nI just have no clue what to do as this is a family and I don\u2019t want to be the one to tell her as Ben has a scary past and knows a lot of people but I feel conflicted as he knows that Lia is one of my best friends and knows that we tell each other everything so I was going to find out eventually \nAita?\n",
