      "selftext": "\nI (37 m) just got engaged to my boyfriend (36 m) of 3.5 years in October. My older sister (41) and her husband are pretty conservative, and I\u2019ve had some issues in the past with them about my being queer. They have four children, and it\u2019s been really hard to keep connecting with them as they grow up because I can\u2019t be honest about who I am. I\u2019ve asked my sister to tell them I\u2019m gay, and her response was \u201cmaybe. I just don\u2019t know when it\u2019s appropriate\u2026\u201d \n\nLast Christmas, I hand made all of the gifts for her kids, and they were addressed from both myself and my partner. My sister made it a point to only mention me. \n\nWhen I called to tell her my boyfriend proposed, she was in the car with her kids. I was trying to be respectful, so told her to call me back when she was alone. She did, I told her my good news, and there was no congratulations, just a \u201cyou must be so happy\u201d. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to be a good sport, just brush it off, but here\u2019s the kicker. \n\nMy mom and dad want to throw us an Engagement Party when we visit for the Holidays, and my oldest sister has yet to respond to her invitation. My mom told her about it weeks before the evites were sent, she\u2019s even opened hers, but she hasn\u2019t responded. I told my mom that if she and her husband choose not to come to the party, to me that says they won\u2019t come to the wedding either.  And that\u2019s a huge deal for me. I\u2019ve been there for every baptism, given presents for every birthday and Christmas, donated to fundraisers and more. If they cannot be there for me, then I\u2019m done. \n\nI haven\u2019t pulled the plug on our relationship before because I don\u2019t want to lose access to my nieces and nephew, but at some point, I have to respect myself enough to be done with them. I know if I cut them off, my sister will twist it to me being intolerant of their beliefs, etc.\n\nAm I the asshole here? Because I\u2019m tired of keeping the peace when I\u2019m disrespected over and over. ",
