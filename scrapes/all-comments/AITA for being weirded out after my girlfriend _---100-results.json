      "selftext": "This is a weird and uncomfortable situation, but I really need some outside opinions. I (38M) have anorexia, specifically the binge/purge subtype. Basically, I starve most of the time, but when I snap and binge, I make myself throw up. I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d and weigh 89.5 lbs, so my BMI is 16.4. I know I\u2019m underweight, but this has been a part of my life for years, and it\u2019s hard to stop. My girlfriend makes it even harder to be frank. \n\nI\u2019ve never dated anyone before my current girlfriend (33F), so I\u2019ve always felt like she\u2019s out of my league. I have no friends too, since I'm terribly socially anxious, she's all I have. She\u2019s cute, outgoing, and seems really into me. But here\u2019s the thing: she makes comments that make me uncomfortable sometimes. She\u2019s told me multiple times that she *loves* how small I am\u2014like, how thin and short I am. At first, I thought it was just a normal compliment, but she\u2019s brought it up a lot. She even seems *nicer* to me on days when I don\u2019t eat much, especially if we\u2019re out on a date. It\u2019s almost like she\u2019s happier when I\u2019m starving and she loves how I'm underweight. \n\nAnyway, a few nights ago, she stayed over at my place. I ended up binging late at night, which I know was a bad choice, so I went to the bathroom to purge like I usually do when this happens. \n\nShe must\u2019ve heard me because she came into the bathroom and asked if I was okay. I felt cornered, so I ended up explaining what I was doing. Instead of being shocked or upset, she just calmly said, \u201cDo you want me to help?\u201d I didn\u2019t really understand what she meant, so I asked, and she said, \u201cI can slip my fingers down your throat if that makes it easier.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say. I just kind of froze, and I guess she took that as permission because she knelt down and actually did it. And yeah, I threw up, but the whole thing felt so...off. It felt like she was *too* into it, almost like she was fascinated by it.  \n\nSince then, I\u2019ve felt weird every time I think about it. I can\u2019t shake the feeling that she\u2019s fetishizing how thin I am and even my eating disorder. It\u2019s like she\u2019s not just okay with it\u2014she *likes* it. \n\nI don't know if I'm reading too much into this. Maybe I should shut it and be grateful that she even likes someone like me. ",
