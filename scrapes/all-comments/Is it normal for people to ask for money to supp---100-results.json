      "selftext": "I am asked often, especially by one friend inparticular, to send money to fund various hobbies their children are doing. This is VERY definitely NOT a family in need, in fact the make a considerable amount of money both over and under the table. I love my friend, I like their two kids (was at the birth of both), but it is making me feel resentful. Unfortunately,  I am on disability due to a brain tumor and some other health reasons, and I am doing my best to hang in there. Both kids got whatever car they wanted (they said they would only accept a Lexus or a tricked out truck/suv...at 16! Both parents make incredible money. The reasons they have asked for money: acting, football, science, soccer lessons, money for the kids spring break, money to allow them to campaign to be little sister/little brother of a fraternity/society. I $hit you not! Even though she knows I am going through a lot, I am still added to the list. I was even singled out stating that everyone could give at least five dollars. The latest goal is 3k for fraternity something. I've spoken to the husband, just to double check to see if there are problems. No, they have never made so much money, house is paid off, etc. It isn't just this one friend, but it is primarily her. I've seen it elsewhere,  but is this a thing? Maybe being Gen X, I don't understand. I got a car when I could afford one and I have never asked anyone to pay my bills. Please explain this to me as this is about to make my head explode. If they were in need, etc., that is one thing, but they definitely are not. Thoughts?? AITA for not wanting to pay for someone else's kids hobbies?",
