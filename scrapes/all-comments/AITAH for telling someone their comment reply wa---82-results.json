      "selftext": "So, this is all embarrassingly about a post in a crafting Facebook group. \n\nI\u2019m a middle school teacher, and I\u2019ve spent the last few days scouring the internet - Pinterest, Google, TPT, YouTube - for a lesson plan or instructions on how to recreate a Pioneer Day project I did as a kid in the 90s. Basically, every quarter my students get to earn a party where we do some kind of craft/fun activity. I thought it would be super fun to make tapered candles the way I did as a kid on Pioneer Day by dipping a wick into a crock pot or something similar. I remember having a really good time and my students really like crafts, plus I thought they may not have participated in anything like this before. After only finding small batch recipes that require pretty expensive, fancy ingredients, I turned to a Facebook group specifically for inexpensive Christmas crafting ideas. I posted my dilemma:\n\n- I have 120+ students\n- I would need to have them complete this in a classroom environment\n- The dipping would have to be done in less than 45 minutes, drying could take longer because we\u2019re doing this 3 days before break\n- the ingredients needed to be fairly cheap or else the school won\u2019t pay for them, and I don\u2019t make enough money to buy them myself. \n\nI mentioned that I have had no luck finding a lesson plan or information that fits the bill, hence why I was reaching out to the group. \n\nAlmost immediately after posting, and an older woman commented \u201cCan you Google it?\u201d \nAnd I, possibly too snarkily, said \u201cthis is such an odd question. Do you really think I didn\u2019t try that first?\u201d Because, again, I mentioned in my OP that I was having trouble finding info. I felt like I included lots of details that made it clear I had, in fact, googled it quite extensively and was having no luck meeting the requirements I had laid out. Then the replies started. Several other women commented: \n\n\u2022 \u201cyou could have been more nice about it \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d \n\n\u2022 \u201c\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd74People are trying to help\u2026Be nicer.\u201d \n\n\u2022 \u201csorry, but your response is very rude. A simple yes I checked Google would have been sufficient.\u201d \n\n\u2022 \u201cchill. You'd be surprised at how many times I've mentioned Google and people hadn't even thought of it.\u201d\n\nI replied twice to the replies and the gist was, \u201cit appears the commenter didn\u2019t read my post or ignored the requirements I needed. They weren\u2019t as helpful as they think they were.\u201d And \u201cI don\u2019t owe anyone niceness\u201d (which I can admit in hindsight isn\u2019t very *nice* either, but I genuinely felt like the original comment was dismissive and rude so I matched energy. As a woman, being told I\u2019m not nice enough is always a little annoying, so I realize this is potentially an issue I had a knee-jerk emotional reaction to.) \n\nI\u2019m sitting on my couch now, having turned off the comments of my OP because I\u2019m also pregnant and it was stressing me out to have a bunch of people call me rude over a reply on a crafting group, but now I\u2019m wondering if I should\u2019ve just left it alone. I felt at the time of my reply like it was actually the other commenter who was initially rude because, imo, \u201cGoogle it\u201d is basically internet speak for \u201cfigure it out yourself\u201d and I was reaching out to this group *because* I was having trouble. Now I\u2019m not sure and considering just talking my L, deleting the OP, and leaving the group.\n\nWhile I realize this is all a bit ridiculous to be writing and posting about, it\u2019s bugging me.
