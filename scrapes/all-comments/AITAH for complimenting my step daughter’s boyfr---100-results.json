      "selftext": "For honesty, my boyfriend and I are not actually married, we\u2019ve been together for about a year and a half. We both have adult children. I will be using fake names. The relevant people here are me 51F, my boyfriend Jay 47M, his daughter Emma 23F, and her boyfriend Levi 23M. Levi and Emma have been together for a year.\n\nI really like Emma, I think she\u2019s smart, pretty, kind, and confident. Her and I get along well. Levi has always been polite to me and gets on well with Jay to the point where they have spent time together without Emma.\n\nEmma and Levi just have a certain energy about them, like a power couple thing. It\u2019s clear that these are cool people, music plays when they walk in in slow motion wearing all black. I make jokes about this to Emma and she usually laughs every time, I just really think they're fun and compliments like that have never been an issue before.\n\nOn thanksgiving Levi came over, he pulled up on his motorcycle and I made a joke to Emma about how her bad boy was here. She just giggled but it didn\u2019t seem like she was upset. When he came in he looked really good, I had never seen him dressed up before and he was wearing like slacks and a nice shirt, like he just looked nice, so I told him he looked amazing and they both thanked me. We were all pretty busy all day so it wasn\u2019t until near the end of the night that I really got to talk to them, and this is where things got bad.\n\nFrom what I\u2019ve been told by Jay, these are the examples of my inappropriate behavior: \n\n-Levi has the most beautiful hair I\u2019ve ever seen, and as a woman with thin, wiry hair, I am super jealous. I told him how pretty it was and I did play with it a little. \n\n-Near the end of the night I talked like an old lady about how we had so many handsome young men around this year (I listed Jay\u2019s sons, my sons, my sister\u2019s sons, and Levi) and I just so happened to be standing next to Jay and I squeezed his arm.\n\n-I sat next to Levi on the crowded couch. Him and Emma ended up switching spots anyway.\n\n-I \u201cfollowed\u201d Levi into the kitchen. I did go into the kitchen shortly after he did to get myself a drink, he had his sleeves rolled up and I made a comment about his strong arms and then I left.\n\n-I asked Levi about his tattoos.\n\n-I hugged Levi too long.\n\nEmma ended up going to stay the night with Levi, and Jay and I got into it that night because he said I was acting weird towards Levi. I did compliment him, he\u2019s a handsome young man, but I did not mean to make it weird. The next day I sent Emma a message apologizing if it seemed like I was being weird. She did not respond to the message and two days later Jay and I got into another fight about it. Over the last like week we\u2019ve been getting in a lot of arguments over it and he told me that Levi and Emma weren\u2019t the only ones that felt weird about how I treated Levi, and this is not the first time he or Emma have felt this way. Finally yesterday, I saw Emma and Levi for the first time since thanksgiving. I tried to apologize to Levi, but Emma jumped in and told me to stop, that she was tired of me being inappropriate.\n\nAfter a fight I ended up leaving, and now Jay told me he thinks we need to talk and I think it might not be a good talk. I really didn\u2019t mean to come off as I was trying to hit on him, I really thought it was coming off as more of a mom figure giving innocent compliments.",
