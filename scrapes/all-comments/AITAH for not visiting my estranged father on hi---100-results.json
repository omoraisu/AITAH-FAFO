      "selftext": "My \u201cFather\u201d has been in and out of my life since I was 8. My mom gave him the choice to get a job or she leaves and takes me and my siblings. He didn\u2019t even bother to fight her on it. He had visitations, there was no legal action taken. Then he disappeared. Showed up only when it was convenient for 12 years. \n\nRecently, his gf and my 6 years old half sister showed up to my work and told me that he was dying from cancer and that it\u2019s terminal, at least 3 weeks left. My uncle went to see him and said it was bad and I should probably go and say goodbye. My sister is in BC and can\u2019t afford the trip back home, my brother and I basically cut him out the last time he left us. \n\nHis gf came to my work again with the kid and asked why I haven\u2019t gone to see him. I said I didn\u2019t want to, and then the kid pipes up:  \u201cdon\u2019t you love dad? He\u2019s our dad!\u201d All I could think was:  \u201che\u2019s leaving you forever. That\u2019s what he does, leaves.\u201d I looked her in the face and said that he hasn\u2019t been my dad since I was 8 and that she is not my sister. Her mom went to my boss and lodged a bs complaint, which she didn\u2019t buy into and the kid cried.  Last night I got a phone call from \u201cdad\u201d and he wanted to see me one last time and that he doesn\u2019t want things to end like this. I told him to fuck himself and the only time we\u2019ll see each other again is in hell. \n\nMy wife thinks I should go see him to finally get things off my chest, but I feel like if I see him, I\u2019d kill him faster than the cancer.",
