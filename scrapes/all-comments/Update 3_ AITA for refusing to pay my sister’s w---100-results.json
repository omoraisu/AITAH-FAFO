      "selftext": "Edit: sorry I forgot the TWs - self harm, depression, SA\n\nToo tired to do the song and dance, so if you want the rundown, it's on my account.\n\nI think I just desperately need to write this out. We went NC with the whole of my side of the family about a month and a half ago aside from my other sister (not Clara).\n\nDecker has been in therapy, and frankly, so have I and Honey both individually and a bi-weekly couples therapy session. A lot has changed.\n\nI didn't realize how much the abuse I suffered at the hands of my uncle really affected me. His reaction to Decker never bothered me or really had a stake in my emotional or mental state, but more that my mother made me forgive him and be polite when he was around. It's always been that way. I was the eldest, so I turned the other cheek until I had no cheeks, then I turned the old ones. I was never really permitted to have negative emotions or get angry. \n\nThis situation with Clara blew a lot of dust up, and Honey and I started to have issues. She noted how reserved I tend to be, and even with her, I struggle with asking for what I want or expression displeasure. I shut down or deflect. It sucks to learn this about yourself when the rest of your world is falling apart.\n\nClara was arrested for my assault and ended up doing a mental health program for a month rather than getting a conviction - as such, her record is clean of that from what I  understand. It was hard cutting her and the others off. My other sister was the one keeping me up to date on everything. Clara got out a while ago.\n\nShe's been trying to get in touch every way she can. She got a new number, email, Facebook, even tiktok. She's written and mailed numerous letters. I am exhausted because I hate cutting everyone off. It's so isolating always having my siblings around and now only really having one sister so suddenly is really lonely.\n\nI focus on Decker and Honey. Honey seems happier overall. She's dancing in the kitchen again, is more affectionate with me, and is more excited to go out and do things. And Decker is also happier. We've focused less on her grades and praise her more for her sense of kindness, her stick-to-it attitude, and more. She's more open with me in particular. \n\nShe talks about crushes and friends more now, shares about the intricate life of a teen. lol it's really very cute.\n\nI'm not so okay, but my family is safe and happy, which is what matters.\n\nClara's fiance Kevin reached out to me 2 days ago. Clara has been released and has been out for a week or so it sounds like, but she still has outpatient rehab to do. It's encouraged for her to have family and to be supported, Kevin says. And he says she isn't doing well. She's started talking about self-harm. And she confided in him that the same uncle that abused me, abused her.\n\nHe's begging me to talk to her and help her through this. He keeps reminded me of how she was before all this and how close we were. Calling what we were close may be incorrect, because based on what I'm learning, our relationship was toxic from the start. I was an enabling sister to a manipulative and narcissistic one. I held my ground and spoke to Honey, who agrees I should keep NC and block Kevin and simply rely on my other sister for info. \n\nBut I can't help but feel guilty. I wish Clara well. But I can't risk cracking the door open and risk the well-being of my family. I think I just feel alone. I know I can't have her in my life anymore. It just hurts. \n\nSorry for the delay in update. And to those who have been gentle or at least firm but fair with me in my private messages, I thank you. There was never a manual on how to be a good wife or mother, and I have lived an existence of feeling so out of my depth. I appreciate the support.",

I cannot imagine how difficult and isolating this must be but you did *not* create the situation and you cannot fix it. You can only protect Decker and Honey from it as much as possible. \nIt seems that Kevin has either developed or learned Clara\u2019s manipulating ways. He needs to go into the same NC box as Clara. Yes, she does need help but if you offer her an inch, she\u2019ll take a mile. She may take it as forgiveness and acceptance of her previous actions. If she does, her actions may very well be more aggressive and she will definitely be harder to reign in, as she\u2019ll expect you to \u201cget over it\u201d again. \n\nHold the line, OP.  Focus on your immediate family - Honey and Decker. Clara and your other siblings are full grown adults. It\u2019s time for them to \u201cgrow up\u201d and act accordingly. \n\nBest wishes!
