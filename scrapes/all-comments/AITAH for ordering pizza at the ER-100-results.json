      "selftext": "So I'm on duty at our local ER and I decided to order pizza with the intent of picking it up. Well, we had a critical patient come in thay required an all hands response. During this incident that lasted around an hour, the pizza place attempted to call me several times and left me a voicemail saying thay not only are they canceling my order, which was understandable, they are banning my phone number from their store. I called as soon as I could, tried to explain the situation, and the response I got from the owner was \"we tried calling you over an hour. I used to work in Healthcare but I can't run a business if people keep calling in orders and not picking them up. I have to ban you. If you try to contact us, I will report you.\" I understand canceling my order, but banning someone because a life was at stake and not allowing me to provide a reason as to why I couldn't answer, and then threatening to \"report\" me? To who?",
