      "selftext": "For context, my husband and I have been together 10 years, married for 4. During these years we went to my great-grandmother's house as well as my mother's house for Christmas. My great-grandmother passed in 2020, so we of course no longer go out there, but we do go to my mom's and started going to my dad's in 2021. My partner is LC with his mom, his dad lives over an hour away, and no one (to my knowledge) had done Christmas at all for years- welp we just weren't invited I guess? \nWe went to his cousin's this year for Thanksgiving and they said \"you guys should come for Christmas, good to see you\" and now my husband is dead set on it. My issue is, this part of the family doesn't like his dad because his mom left his dad for his dad's cousin, and so they're giving weird energy when we are there. Also, no one really talked to us, which I guess fair because we haven't been around (his aunt actually pointed out they've never met me and i'm \"brand new\" though I have been with him for a decade), but I know he wants to get back into that side of his dad's family because of our son being born and wanting that family connection.\nI feel like if they didn't make an effort for him to come around for the last decade, why all the sudden should we be jumping to and from 3 houses plus our own on Christmas? WIBTA if I asked him not to go? ",
