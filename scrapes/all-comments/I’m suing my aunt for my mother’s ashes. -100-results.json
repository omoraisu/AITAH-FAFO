      "selftext": "My mother passed away back in 2010, I was only 11. My mother and father were divorced at the time. My grandmother had my mother\u2019s ashes as she was the executor of my mother\u2019s funeral. BUT my father paid for a certain amount of ashes to be sent to me and my two brothers. We never receive them and she refused to give them to us. She disowned me and my brothers. And her reasoning was because we were our father\u2019s children. Well, now that she passed away, my mother\u2019s sister has them. We live in different states. I had contacted her several times to get them and she refused. About a year ago she contacted me saying she would send them making me believe when she said it was our right to have our mother with us, she sent me pictures of the damaged urn, it\u2019s was a beautiful white angel and now the wing is broken and is caked with cigarette smoke and is now yellow. She never sent it, as she only wanted money from me. And when I refused to send her money before I got the ashes, she blocked me. Now with all the playing around. I decided to contact a lawyer to sue her for the damages of the urn, the mental breakdowns me and my brothers have endured, and custody of the ashes. AITAH. ",
