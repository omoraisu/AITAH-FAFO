      "selftext": "33M. My wife is currently 7 months pregnant with our daughter. The first time she was pregnant, she went into premature labor and had a stillbirth. It was a devastating experience for both of us, but especially my sweet wife. She\u2019s finally getting excited about this pregnancy, but there is a part of her that is afraid to get her hopes up in case something goes wrong. She asks me several times a day if I think something will happen and has been having nightmares about having another stillbirth. Luckily, her doctor says everything is going well so far, and I\u2019m confident everything will work out okay this time.\n\nMy wife and I are from the same town, but live around nine hours driving distance from our families. Right now, the plan is for my wife\u2019s mother to drive up once my wife goes into labor. She\u2019s going to support my wife during the labor and also stay for a week or so after the baby is born to help us get settled.  My wife explicitly said that she doesn\u2019t want any visitors aside from her mom for the first few weeks after the baby is born. She told me wants my family to visit a few weeks after the baby is born and even said my parents could stay in the guest room so they get more quality time with their granddaughter once we\u2019re ready for visitors. I truly just want this process to go as smoothly as possible for my wife in light of what she went through the last time around, and so I\u2019m 100% behind whatever plan makes her feel the most comfortable. \n\nYesterday, I got a call from my mom asking about the birth plan. I explained our current plan, and my mom said that she and my dad would drive up once my wife goes into labor. She didn\u2019t mention being in the delivery room, but said they\u2019d be in the waiting room to meet their granddaughter.  She also said they\u2019d stay at a hotel nearby and so they could spend time with the baby once she\u2019s home.\n\nI told my mom that we\u2019re excited for her to come up and meet the baby, but we\u2019d prefer if she wait a few weeks until we\u2019re settled. My mom said that my MIL is coming up right after the birth, and so she doesn\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t be there. I explained that my MIL is there to support my wife during the labor and help her get settled after the baby is born. I added that my wife obviously feels more comfortable with her mom and doesn\u2019t feel pressure to have the house spotless and be the perfect hostess when her mom comes over. I also said that we want her and my dad to get a lot of time with the baby, and we don\u2019t know how my wife is going to be feeling immediately after the birth. My mom started rambling about how boy\u2019s mom always gets the short end of the stick and everyone should be included when it comes to major milestones like the birth of a child. \n\nThe funny thing is that my younger sister had her first baby about six months ago. She can\u2019t stand her MIL, and she STILL hasn\u2019t given her the green light to come and visit. My mom and my sister have both justified this by saying her MIL is rude and difficult to be around. This is true, but also, my sister holds grudges and doesn\u2019t get along with most relatives. \n\nI responded to my mom by asking why she\u2019s okay with my sister keeping her baby away from her MIL for six months if everyone should be included. My mom was furious. She said that there was more to the situation than I realize and that this situation is completely different since she\u2019s always been perfectly nice to my wife. I asked what I was missing, and my mom just said that my sister\u2019s MIL ruined her bridal shower by bringing her obnoxious friends.\n\nI said regardless of the situation, I want to make this experience as stress free as possible for my wife given what happened last time. I said that she just wants me and my mom for a while, and I understand her perspective. I told my mom I love her and am excited for her to visit, and we\u2019ll make sure she gets plenty of time with her granddaughter. She seemed disappointed, but I thought we were on the same page.\n\nA few hours ago, my wife told me that she got a call from my mother. She said my mom was crying and saying she felt excluded and like we didn\u2019t want her to meet the baby. My wife is a sweetheart and a people pleaser and she truly took this to heart. She seemed stressed and asked me if we were doing the right thing. I told my wife I wanted her to feel as comfortable as possible and that I\u2019d deal with my mom moving forward. \n\nI was furious to say the least. The stress isn\u2019t good for my wife, and she\u2019s already under a lot of it because of her fears that history will repeat itself. I called my mom back and told her that if she calls my wife about the situation again, she won\u2019t get to see the baby for two months. I said I\u2019d add a month for every call after that. I meant this kind of as a joke, but I was being serious that she can\u2019t be putting this stress on my wife right now. My mom said we were excluding her and my father and that they raised me better than this.\n\nMy dad called and said I was wrong to give my mom an ultimatum and punish her for expressing her feelings. He said that I was using time with the baby as a form of control. I explained that I want them to have a good relationship with my kid, but I desperately don\u2019t want any extra stress on my wife right now. My dad says I owe my mom an apology for saying I\u2019ll add months to the wait time every time she speaks to my wife about the birth plan. I disagree. Aitah?",

      "selftext": "I (38F) have a 15-year-old daughter, \u201cEmma.\u201d For her birthday, I decided to throw a small gathering at our house with her best friend, Mia, and a few family members. My brother, \u201cEvan\u201d (45M), offered to help out. Emma adores Evan\u2014he\u2019s the \u201ccool\u201d uncle who\u2019s always joking around and treating her like an adult. I\u2019ve always been uneasy about how permissive he is, but I never imagined he\u2019d cross such a massive line.  \n\nThe evening started fine with music, snacks, and laughter. At one point, I stepped away to finish some work, trusting Evan to keep an eye on things. About an hour later, I went to check on them. I couldn\u2019t find Emma, Mia, or Evan anywhere. After asking a few guests, someone said they were in Emma\u2019s bedroom, \u201cplaying board games.\u201d I had a bad feeling about it, so I headed upstairs.  \n\nWhat I walked into made my stomach drop. Mia was half-passed out, slumped on the bed in Emma\u2019s room, barely able to sit up and throwing up all over herself. Emma and Evan were hovering over her, both panicked and trying to keep her awake. I immediately demanded to know what had happened. Emma looked petrified and didn\u2019t say much, but Evan\u2014calmly, almost nonchalantly\u2014admitted he had let them drink.  \n\nWhen I pressed for details, he shrugged and said Mia had had about 600ml of vodka. He said it like it was no big deal, casually adding, \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2014I was supervising them.\u201d I was horrified. Mia was barely conscious, struggling to even breathe properly, and Evan acted like this was normal.  \n\nI called an ambulance right away, and Mia was rushed to the hospital. The doctors confirmed she had alcohol poisoning. Thankfully, she\u2019ll recover, but the situation could have ended far worse. I was shaking with guilt, fury, and disbelief.  \n\nWhen I got back home, I unleashed all my anger on Evan. I told him he had crossed an unforgivable line by putting two 15-year-olds in danger. He tried to justify himself, saying teens are going to drink anyway, and he thought it was \u201cbetter\u201d if they did it around him. He even smirked while saying it, which made my blood boil. I told him to pack his things and get out of my house immediately. I also told him he\u2019s not welcome around Emma until further notice.  \n\nWhat crushed me the most was when Emma later admitted, tearfully, that this wasn\u2019t the first time Evan had let her drink with him. She begged me not to cut him off and said I was overreacting, claiming Evan didn\u2019t mean for things to go so far. She also blames me for \u201cruining her birthday\u201d and won\u2019t speak to me now.  \n\nI\u2019m devastated and furious all at once. I feel like I failed to protect my daughter, but at the same time, I can\u2019t just forgive Evan for what he did. Emma doesn\u2019t see it that way, though, and thinks I\u2019m being unfair.  \n",

Honestly, I don\u2019t even know what to think anymore.\n\nSo, a few weeks ago, my husband (30M) started acting really weird. He was being distant, barely talking to me, and even started sleeping on the couch a few nights. Every time I asked him what was wrong, he\u2019d just say he was stressed from work. I figured he\u2019d talk to me when he was ready, but it just kept getting worse.\n\nThen one night, he comes out and accuses me of cheating. I was shocked. He said he \u201cknew everything\u201d and that he\u2019d already been told about my \u201caffair.\u201d I was like, what the actual hell are you talking about? Turns out, my cousin told him she saw me at some work event \u201cgetting cozy\u201d with a coworker and heard I was hooking up with him.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing none of this is true. The work event she\u2019s talking about? She wasn\u2019t even there. The coworker she mentioned? He\u2019s gay and in a serious relationship. I explained all this to my husband, but it took a lot to convince him because he really thought my cousin wouldn\u2019t lie about something like that. I even had to get my coworker to back me up and confirm it was all BS. My husband eventually apologized, but this whole thing put a massive strain on our relationship.\n\nWhen I confronted my cousin, she acted like it was no big deal. She said she was \u201cjust trying to help\u201d my husband and thought he deserved to know \u201cthe truth.\u201d But her story didn\u2019t even make sense, and when I pressed her on it, she got all defensive and refused to apologize.

I told her I couldn\u2019t have someone so toxic in my life and cut her off completely.

      "selftext": "Throwaway account because my SIL is on reddit. \n\nI (39F) have a grand piano that\u2019s been in my family for generations. It was originally my great-grandmother\u2019s, passed down to my grandmother, then my mother, and now me. It\u2019s a Steinway grand piano, worth more than I care to say, but its value is more sentimental than monetary. It\u2019s been lovingly cared for and holds countless memories of family gatherings, holidays, and music lessons. I\u2019ve always treated it as more than a piece of furniture\u2014it\u2019s a part of our family history.\n\nLast weekend, I hosted a family gathering, and my sister-in-law, \u201cLaura\u201d (29F), came with her two kids (6M and 4F). Her kids are a handful, to put it mildly. I made it clear when they arrived that the piano was strictly off-limits. I even put up a sign that says, \u201cDo not touch.\u201d\n\nAt some point during the party, I noticed her youngest running his hands over the keys while Laura just laughed. I told her it wasn\u2019t a toy, and she said, \u201cOh, it\u2019s fine, he\u2019s just curious,\u201d but pulled him away. I thought that was the end of it.\n\nLater, I walked into the living room and nearly had a heart attack. Her older son was *standing on top of the piano* while Laura stood nearby, taking pictures like it was cute! I yelled at them to stop immediately, but by the time the kid got down, the damage was done. There were deep scratches all over the lid and top of the piano.\n\nI was furious. I told Laura she needed to leave, and she got defensive, saying I was being \u201cdramatic\u201d and that \u201cit\u2019s just a piano.\u201d She refused to apologize and even accused me of being \u201cuptight\u201d for caring so much about an \u201cold piece of wood.\u201d\n\nThat night, I texted her to let her know she and her kids are no longer welcome in my house. She responded by calling me petty and claimed I was \u201cpunishing her kids for being kids.\u201d Some family members are on my side, saying Laura was reckless and disrespectful. Others think I\u2019m overreacting and being too harsh, saying it\u2019s just a piano and I shouldn\u2019t ban family over it.\n\nTo me, this isn\u2019t just a piano\u2014it\u2019s a part of my family\u2019s history that she let her kids ruin while she stood there laughing.

      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I really need some perspective here because my head is all over the place. I (27F) recently broke up with my boyfriend of two years, Jake (29M), after discovering something that honestly still makes me feel sick.\n\nFor context, I\u2019ve worked super hard to get where I am in life. I lost my dad when I was really young and grew up watching my mom struggle to make ends meet. That motivated me to be really careful with money. I work in marketing now (for an OnlyFans agency don\u2019t judge), and I\u2019ve been lucky enough to save up quite a bit. By the time this all happened, I had just over $30k saved, plus a couple of credit cards I only used for emergencies.\n\nJake and I always had different financial situations. He\u2019s had trouble holding down stable jobs, but I didn\u2019t mind helping him out now and then. I loved him and figured relationships are about supporting each other, right? I thought I could trust him.\n\nA few weeks ago, I went to check my bank account to move some money into my savings, and it was empty. Like, completely wiped out. At first, I thought there was some kind of mistake or fraud. Then I checked my credit cards they were maxed out, too. Altogether, he\u2019d burned through over $50k.\n\nWhen I confronted him, he admitted he\u2019d been secretly transferring money from my account and using my cards for months. He said he wanted to \u201ctreat me\u201d and \u201cfeel like he could give me the life I deserve.\u201d But the charges? They weren\u2019t for me. He\u2019d been buying designer clothes, the newest tech gadgets, and spending ridiculous amounts at high-end clubs... for him and his friends.\n\nI was shaking when he confessed. I couldn\u2019t believe the person I thought I knew could do something like this. He broke down crying, saying he never meant for it to go so far, and he\u2019d pay me back. But how? He\u2019s broke. He doesn\u2019t even have a stable job.\n\nI told him to pack his stuff and leave my apartment. We\u2019re done. But now I\u2019m stuck trying to figure out what to do. I\u2019ve worked so hard to build my savings, and now I\u2019m drowning in debt because of him. I\u2019ve been thinking about suing him, but some of our mutual friends are telling me that\u2019s too extreme, that it would destroy him. They say I should just give him time to pay me back. But how can I trust him after this?\n\nPart of me feels guilty for even thinking about taking legal action against someone I loved, but I don\u2019t know what else to do. This is my future he\u2019s destroyed.\n\nSo, AITAH for breaking up with him and considering suing him if he doesn\u2019t pay me back? Or should I just cut my losses and move on? I\u2019m so confused.",

But from his insurance and other investments, i created a trust fund for my son and the money there is around 150k usd.  I have done good career wise and is employed at government job. Which is secure job till 60 and pays decently to live upper middle class life style . \n\nI met my current husband when I was 30 ( he was 32 )  during some event. We connected from day one and a year later we got married. My husband has twins aged 15 m and 15 f.  Their mother is involved in their life and my husband made clear from day one that children finances will be kept seperate. We share grocery , necessities and clothes etc fund. But savings and school fees are kept seperately. We also own our homes separately. And I am currently living at his house and renting my own.note that rent is exclusively used for whole family travels etc.  My son and his children get along fine. But they don't call us parents or each other siblings. We also have a daughter together who is 7. Also I save lot for young daughter as she won't have this trust fund and I want to secure her future.\n\n\nRecent issue has been that my son has that fund and he wants to study in australia and is preparing for his move next year. My husband children has their fund. But max he can contribute to each children's fund is 25k . He lost money on gambling and his ex wife doesn't save \n\nHe says let's join all funds and is pressuring my son. He was giving in. I refused. I said it was my son's inheritance from his dad and that can't cover the loss of father. My husband exploded and abused verbally in anger..I also didn't hold back. He slapped me. First time ever in life he hit me\n\nWe sorted out things later but I am not going to give this fund..my step children who have always been cordial to me are suddenly calling me evil monster. Same children for those who I prepare meals every morning at 6 am. Wash their clothes. Iron them. And buy them clothes and other things despite my husband barely doing it for my son. If combined.

She\u2019s always been the sweetest to me, so I wanted to make her gift thoughtful.\nRachel frequently mentions her husband and their shared love of hiking, so I got her a fancy pair of hiking boots and a gift card to an outdoor gear store. During the exchange, she opened my gift, and I made a joking comment like, \u201cHopefully your husband doesn\u2019t already have these boots, or you two can match!\u201d\nHer face turned bright red, and the room got super awkward. I thought maybe she just didn\u2019t like the gift. But later that day, one of my coworkers, Dan (M), who I\u2019m casually friendly with, pulled me aside and said, \u201cYou know Rachel isn\u2019t hiking with her husband, right?\u201d I had no idea what he was talking about, so he spilled that Rachel\u2019s been having an affair with Steve (M), another manager in our office, and they\u2019ve been sneaking away on hiking trips together. Apparently, it\u2019s been an open secret among a few coworkers, but I genuinely had no clue. My \u201cmatch with your husband\u201d joke unintentionally exposed their whole situation because now Rachel thinks someone told me about the affair and that I was making a passive-aggressive dig. The fallout has been insane. Rachel has been cold toward me ever since, and Steve won\u2019t even make eye contact. Meanwhile, the office gossip has exploded, and I feel like everyone\u2019s whispering about it. A couple of coworkers said I should\u2019ve been more careful with my joke, but others think Rachel and Steve brought this on themselves. AITA for unknowingly exposing my boss\u2019s affair with an innocent Secret Santa comment?\n\nEDIT: everyone saying this is fake, I appreciate your confidence in my ability to think things up. \nTo explain, we did secret santa this past Friday, the week before thanksgiving. We are a small office, pretty well off, and all value our personal time. There are a handful of us that will be out of office beginning Monday throughout the holiday\u2026 AITAH for not doing secret santa in December?? Lol. \n\nFurther, I got her expensive shoes because I can. I didn\u2019t expect such a thing from whoever got my gift, nor did I expect the price to be an issue. I can treat people around me with nice things so why shouldn\u2019t I? ",

She had rear-ended another car at a stoplight, and my car was pretty badly damaged. Thankfully, no one was hurt, but the front bumper and hood were smashed.\n\nWhen I got to the scene, she admitted she was texting while driving. I was upset but tried to stay calm since we were in public and I didn\u2019t want to make things worse.\n\nNow comes the issue: I expected her to take responsibility for the repairs since she was at fault. However, when I brought it up, she said she didn\u2019t have the money and told me to claim it on my insurance instead. The problem is, my deductible is pretty high, and filing a claim will increase my premiums. I explained this to her, but she insisted she couldn\u2019t afford it and said it was on me because I had agreed to lend her the car.\n\nShe then said I was being unreasonable and that family should always help each other. I told her that borrowing a car comes with the basic responsibility of driving safely, and texting while driving was 100% on her.\n\nThings escalated when other family members got involved. Some are telling me I should just let it go and pay for the repairs to avoid conflict, while others agree that she\u2019s at fault and should figure out how to handle the expenses.\n\nNow I\u2019m stuck in the middle, with my car still damaged and no resolution in sight.

      "selftext": "I (22M) have a koi pond in my backyard. It\u2019s not just any koi pond\u2014it\u2019s a full-blown, professionally designed Japanese garden with a bridge, waterfalls, and koi that cost more than my car (I\u2019m talking $1,000 for a single fish). Maintaining this pond is my pride and joy. I\u2019ve put years into this hobby, and my yard is securely fenced with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs everywhere.\n\nEnter my neighbor, \u201cKaren\u201d (fake name, but fitting). Karen has a son, let\u2019s call him Timmy (8M), who is notorious for wandering into other people\u2019s yards uninvited. I\u2019ve talked to Karen multiple times about this, but she just brushes it off with, \u201cKids will be kids.\u201d\n\nLast week, while I was out running errands, I got a frantic call from Karen. Apparently, Timmy *climbed over my fence* to \u201cfeed the fish\u201d (even though I have explicitly told him to stay out). In doing so, he slipped, fell into the pond, and destroyed part of my carefully maintained ecosystem. Several of my prized koi died due to stress, and the filtration system was damaged because of the debris Timmy kicked in.\n\nLuckily, Timmy wasn\u2019t seriously hurt\u2014just a few scrapes\u2014but Karen has been *demanding* I pay for his medical bills. She claims my pond is an \"attractive nuisance\" and that I should\u2019ve had a cover or something to prevent kids from falling in. I argued that (1) it\u2019s a private, fenced property, and (2) her son had no business being there in the first place.\n\nWhen I refused to pay, Karen lost it and started badmouthing me to the whole neighborhood, calling me \u201cheartless\u201d and a \u201cterrible person.\u201d I\u2019ve since filed a lawsuit against her for the cost of the koi, the damage to my filtration system, and repairs to my pond\u2014over $5,000 in total.\n\nSome of my friends think I\u2019m taking it too far, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d But others agree that Karen should\u2019ve been watching him better.

      "selftext": "Okay, so I (27F) feel sick even writing this because I never thought it would come to this. My best friend \"Claire\" (27F) and I have been close since high school. She was there for me through everything losing my dad when I was a baby, struggles with my recovery (I'm a recovering alcoholic), and all the usual growing up drama. She was the one person I thought I could trust with anything. I\u2019ve been dating \u201cJake\u201d (29M) for about 6 months now, and it\u2019s been amazing. He\u2019s sweet, supportive, and honestly one of the healthiest relationships I\u2019ve ever had. He knows about my past, my boundaries, and has always been super respectful. Claire met him a couple of times, and she seemed to like him, but something about how she acted at our last hangout just\u2026 didn\u2019t sit right. Last weekend, Jake and I hosted a small dinner party for a few friends, including Claire. Everything seemed normal at first, but as the night went on, Claire started acting kinda weird. She was laughing at everything Jake said, leaning in close to him, and even made this stupid joke like, \u201cIf I had met you first, you\u2019d be mine.\u201d I laughed it off at the time, but it felt... off, you know? The next morning, Jake told me he needed to talk to me about something. He looked so uncomfortable, and my heart immediately sank. He said after I went to bed, Claire followed him into the kitchen and started talking about how \"he deserved better\" and \"wasn't I lucky to have him.\" Then she flat-out told him she\u2019d always wondered what it\u2019d be like to hook up with him. She even tried to kiss him, but Jake shut her down and told her to leave. I felt like the ground was ripped out from under me. I didn\u2019t want to believe it, but Jake has never given me any reason not to trust him. He said he felt guilty even being around her after what happened and that I deserved to know. When I confronted Claire over text (I knew I\u2019d lose it if I called), she denied it. She said Jake must\u2019ve \u201cmisread\u201d her or was making it up to make me distrust her. When I told her I believed him, she flipped out, saying I was insecure, choosing a guy over her, and that I was \u201cthrowing away 10+ years of friendship\u201d for no reason. Now, a few mutual friends are involved because Claire told them her version of the story, and they\u2019re saying I\u2019m overreacting. They\u2019re like, \u201cShe was drunk; it doesn\u2019t mean anything\u201d or \u201cDon\u2019t ruin a decade-long friendship over a misunderstanding.\u201d But to me, this doesn\u2019t feel like a misunderstanding. It feels like a betrayal, and I honestly don\u2019t know if I can ever trust her again. I\u2019ve stopped responding to her messages and calls, but now I\u2019m second-guessing myself because so many people are telling me I\u2019m in the wrong. Did I blow this out of proportion?",

Basically, I starve most of the time, but when I snap and binge, I make myself throw up. I\u2019m 5\u20192\u201d and weigh 89.5 lbs, so my BMI is 16.4. I know I\u2019m underweight, but this has been a part of my life for years, and it\u2019s hard to stop.

I have no friends too, since I'm terribly socially anxious, she's all I have. She\u2019s cute, outgoing, and seems really into me. But here\u2019s the thing: she makes comments that make me uncomfortable sometimes. She\u2019s told me multiple times that she *loves* how small I am\u2014like, how thin and short I am. At first, I thought it was just a normal compliment, but she\u2019s brought it up a lot. She even seems *nicer* to me on days when I don\u2019t eat much, especially if we\u2019re out on a date.

I felt cornered, so I ended up explaining what I was doing. Instead of being shocked or upset, she just calmly said, \u201cDo you want me to help?\u201d I didn\u2019t really understand what she meant, so I asked, and she said, \u201cI can slip my fingers down your throat if that makes it easier.\u201d  \n\nI didn\u2019t know what to say. I just kind of froze, and I guess she took that as permission because she knelt down and actually did it. And yeah, I threw up, but the whole thing felt so...off.

She was interested in knowing things like how it felt to be with woman and what not. She said our generation is lucky to get to live as we want. I dug further and she confessed to having interest in women. I was the first person she told.\n\nOver the months we grew pretty close and we eventually slept together. I told this to my friends and most of them were either not really judging or didn't want to say it. Some of them commented about her cheating on her husband. For her divorce is very difficult option for multiple reasons. Then coming out is much more than that. Her marriage is result of society pushing her into it, which she can't leave.\n\nEdit: I did not tell my friends who she is, or even that she is from our society. Also I trust them not to seek out who it is or even be interested in knowing.",

Loud, obnoxious, cringy narcissistic AH who makes everything about his money, and his only favorite social pastime is drinking and boring smalltalk. I genuinely can't see why my sister is so head over heels about him, but whatever, it's her choice, not my business. \n\nNow, my sister informed my parents she and her new BF will be spending Christmas holiday at my parents' place, bcs BF has nowhere else to go and she won't leave him to stay alone. Mind you, Christmas in my country is quite private event to be spent only with immediate family. I told my parents I feel like BF is kinda intruding, they've been together only for a few months, I don't consider him close and the way he tries to push himself into our family feels way too rushed for my taste. I don't feel comfortable being at his obnoxious presence for several days and if this intention comes into being, I'd rather not come and spend Christmas at my place. There are also practical reasons, like my parents' apartment can't accommodate 5 people. My parents agree with me and (funnily) they don't like BF either, but being cowardly people-pleasers, they were not able to relay the message to my sister and simply agreed to welcome BF for Christmas. \n\nNow, my mum and dad are pushing me to come too to play family with the cringy AH, which I politely refused. They are guilt-tripping me, saying I'm the one who caused the dilemma and \"made them choose\", which is a pile of bullshit, bcs the dilemma was caused first and foremost by my sister and her idea of inviting BF to our family Christmas. \n\nObviously, I'm hurt and angry bcs Christmas has always be an exceptionally lovely time for me and since I live far from my parents, it used to be a time when we could reconnect. I'm also sad bcs my parents yet again prioritized my sister's wishes, since she has always been the favorite child of the family and it simply hurts to once again feel unimportant and second-rate like when I was a kid. \n\nMy BF told me very bluntly I'm overreacting, being childish and making everything about myself. He refused to spend Christmas with me and will be visiting his own family. So I'm wondering if I'm really overreacting and being stupid, but I'm fed up with trying to be helpful and please my parents only to have them walking all over me in favour of my sister. \n",

My relationship with my in-laws has been on the rocks since 2020 coming to a head a year ago and we are walking on eggshells now. \n\nThis year I told my husband I wouldn't cook anything but would only bring wine or something store bought. I told him that I am unwilling to put time and effort into cooking something only to have it go to waste. He listed off a few dishes I make thay he loves that his in laws wouldn't ever make for Thanksgiving. I stood my ground though and said no and why. So he agreed and let it go. \n\nHowever the numbers are in and there will be a large group this year. I couldn't stop myself (lord help me and my stupid people pleasing self) I asked what I could bring to ease the load. They shockingly told me a rather important dish. So of course I will make it. \n\nI told my husband if I show up and they have already made said dish -AGAIN- I will turn my butt right around and walk back out. That I am no longer willing to put up with this stupid mind game. He thinks that would be dramatic and I should just put mine out anyway and they will love it because I am such a good cook.

I explained how I felt really frustrated that they told me the parental controls were because they bought the phone and then when my dad bought me a phone they still put the same restrictions. They said they were sorry they gave that impression and that they could have explained it better. \n\nThey asked which were the restrictions I had the biggest issue with; I said how I can\u2019t text/call anyone unless they approve it, how the phone locks at 8pm, I can\u2019t use it, and that I only have a 30 min on YouTube or TikTok and that I can\u2019t have apps like Snapchat, discord, instagram etc. They said okay, they understood why I was upset and frustrated and said they will discuss with my social worker how they can lighten up the rules while still ensuring I am safe. They said they don\u2019t want me having a long time on the phone because they don\u2019t think it\u2019s good for me, but they said in the meantime they will increase the limit to 1 hour for YT/TT and that they will increase the bedtime until 9pm. I think this is a fair compromise. \n\nI said they seemed upset that I got a new phone in general, and they said they weren\u2019t upset at me but were upset at the situation. I asked what they meant, and they said that it was something between them and my dad and I didn\u2019t need to worry about it. But I asked them to carry on and I had to kind of persuade them to tell me. They had actually bought a iPhone 16 pro max for Xmas for me and had told my parents and my social worker that they had bought it and were going to give it me for Xmas. But my dad bought one before they could give me theirs and they felt upset that their big present had been ruined. But they said that wasn\u2019t my fault and they didn\u2019t mean to make me feel like they didn\u2019t care about what my dad got me. \n\nHonestly that made me feel upset, I asked my dad why he bought me the phone if he knew that Henry and Erin already did. He said he didn\u2019t want Henry and Erin to have to give me something so expensive. But I said they had already bought it for me and he knew that. I said that was unfair and that he shouldn\u2019t have done that. He called me ungrateful. I asked him how he would have felt if it was the other way around and he left me on read :/\n\nI actually feel really upset for Henry and Erin that my dad did that to them and I actually feel guilty even though I didn\u2019t know they had already bought me one. I\u2019m not sure what to do now, I could give my phone back to my dad and have Henry and Erin\u2019s but idk if that\u2019s the right thing to do. Henry and Erin said that it wasn\u2019t my fault and that it doesn\u2019t mean my dad is a bad person, which I know. But I do feel really angry at him.\n",

A few months ago, they came to me saying they were falling behind on rent and bills. They seemed desperate, and I felt guilty because I can afford to help, so I agreed to send them $1,600 a month to help them get back on their feet.\n\nAt first, I didn\u2019t think much about it. I trusted they were using it responsibly. But then, I visited them last week, and the first thing I saw was a brand-new flat-screen TV in the living room. There were other new things too a new designer bag, a fancy coffee machine, and they casually mentioned ordering takeout \u201calmost every night\u201d because my mom doesn\u2019t like to cook anymore.\n\nWhen I asked how they could afford all of this, my mom shrugged and said, \u201cOh, we just wanted to enjoy ourselves a little!

Im a good ole blue collar country girl who likes to fish, hunt, work on motorcycles and watch college football.\n\nI go to bed with her everyday of the week between 9-930pm. Tonight, we had a Friendsgiving get together. Everyone was chatting and having a beer or two until about 9 o\u2019clock, when she announced she was tired and asked everyone to leave. I personally thought this was a little rude since this whole shindig was her idea. After everyone left, it\u2019s about 9:15 and I\u2019m letting the dogs out for a bathroom break and i come back inside. She asks if I\u2019m coming to bed now. I tell her no, I have a beer I\u2019m finishing and there\u2019s a football game I\u2019m trying to watch. She says we need to keep our same sleep schedule 7 days a week and I\u2019m being unhealthy. I drink once a week and never get crazy drunk or even noticeably drunk. I just wanna drink a few beers and watch football. I tell her I don\u2019t think I\u2019m being unreasonable wanting to stay up til 10pm on a Saturday. She argues that she won\u2019t be able to sleep til I come to bed and again, I\u2019m being unhealthy (even though I workout 5-6 days a week). We go back and forth civilly until she finally says she tired of arguing. She eventually tells me she doesn\u2019t care where I sleep as long as it\u2019s not with her in our bedroom, essentially telling me she\u2019s so upset now that I am not welcome in the bedroom???\n\nI have a history of being a doormat in my previous relationships, so I made myself stand my ground and tell her that I didn\u2019t feel I was being unreasonable wanting to stay up past my bedtime on the weekend. Her argument is that I\u2019M being unhealthy and also (and what I believe her real motive is) she can\u2019t fall asleep until I\u2019m in bed because she\u2019s such a light sleeper that I\u2019ll wake her up coming to bed.

After I was born, due to some family drama and to be closer to my grandparents we had to leave. \n\nHowever, this means that my younger brother was not born in the US, and only holds Indian citizenship. \n\nMy younger brother was supposed to go to university in the US last year, but couldn\u2019t because his student visa got rejected. He blamed this on me and our brother. He said that when he went for his visa interview, everything was going well until they asked him whether he has any immediate family members that are US citizens or living in the US. So when he disclosed that both his older siblings are American, he claims that the entire tone of the interview changed. Mind you, this is entirely speculation. He wasn\u2019t told why his visa was rejected, just that it was unsuccessful. \n\nHe was horrible in the weeks after the rejection. He would alternate between ignoring me and screaming at me. Once he stole my wallet and went on a shopping spree with my card and didn\u2019t apologise because I \u201cowe\u201d him. \n\nHe still acts out sometimes, but it\u2019s gotten much better since he moved out and started uni this year. I don\u2019t put up with him when he acts like that, which I think worries our parents because they think our relationship will never recover. \n\nMy mom tells me to forgive him, look the other way when he says hurtful things and think about how much stress he went through and how all his hopes had come crashing down. I told her I don\u2019t believe I should have to do that, but she just says I\u2019m being ungrateful. In her mind, I\u2019ve never been through anything like that so it\u2019s not fair that I\u2019m being \u2018hard\u2019 on my brother. ",

The guy said to me a few minutes later that i should apologize to her which i didn't do. I then said \"why should i apologize if you are always bullying me, first things first you guys should apologize to me...\"\nMost of the group was stunned that i said the \"secret\" out loud, some of them said it was totally inappropriate.\nAITA for saying this?\n\ntldnr: because i was angry for beeing bullied i said a \"secret\" of a couple on an early\nchristmas party everyone already knows about?",

No, they have never made so much money, house is paid off, etc. It isn't just this one friend, but it is primarily her. I've seen it elsewhere,  but is this a thing?

Now I have more details.\n\nMy ex\u2019s stepson had plans to go bowling with some friends. His biological father had already given him permission and money for the outing. However, when he told his mother, she said he couldn\u2019t go because they needed him to stay home and watch his younger siblings. My ex and his wife had planned an outing and needed someone to stay with the kids.\n\nThis led to an argument. The boy raised his voice to his mother, and my ex stepped in to demand that he respect her. The boy replied that he wasn\u2019t his father. Trying to maintain authority, my ex told him that as long as he lived under his roof, he had to follow his rules. The boy ignored him and turned away. My ex followed him and touched his shoulder to get his attention. At that moment, the boy turned around, punched him, and shouted that he wasn\u2019t his father and could never compare to him.\n\nThe mother scolded him for his behavior, but the boy, still angry, shouted back that he hated her.\n\nThis version was shared by my ex and his wife to my ex-mother in law. My sister in law later relayed it to me. They went to see my ex-mother-in-law to try to gain her sympathy and convince her to take care of the kids the two stepchildren and the baby  so they could go out. However, my ex-mother-in-law told them she would not take care of the children.\n\nWhen I spoke to my ex, he mentioned he was dealing with family issues and claimed that the boy\u2019s biological father was turning him against him. He didn\u2019t give me many details and omitted most of what my sister in law had shared. He simply informed me that, due to the situation, he wouldn\u2019t be able to pick up our children this weekend.\n\nThe 15-year-old boy is now staying with his biological father.\n\nAs for what I mentioned earlier, my ex was two months behind on child support, and that same week, he was supposed to make another payment. He didn\u2019t, leaving him three months behind. In the end, his mother was the one who covered the overdue amount.\n\nRegarding the child who attends the same school as my son, it\u2019s not the 15 year old involved in the altercation. It\u2019s his younger stepbrother, who is 8 years old, the same age as my son.\n\nI decided to enroll my son in that school when the affair became public. At the time, I was working as a kindergarten teacher at the same school, and the boy had been one of my students. We all knew each other, and to protect my children from rumors, I transferred them to a private school. This happened two months before the school year ended. Thanks to the circumstances and the support of some kind people, we managed to get them admitted.\n",

Male brazilians are scheduled 30-45 minutes and Female brazilian\u2019s are 15-30.  \n\n2 days ago I had a guest come in who booked for a female Brazilian. I took them back and prepared them, came back in and right when I took away the sheet I immediately noticed that I couldn\u2019t tell what exactly I was looking at. I deal with genitalia all day and have had every kind of anatomy. I honestly was trying to figure out if this was a male or female area while cleansing the skin and couldn\u2019t figure it out, which is fine, the most important part of my job is making my guest feel comfortable. \n\nI am no doctor but from what I saw was what appeared to be an oversized clitoris (or maybe the tip of a small penis)and the outer labias but no vagina. I assumed I was working with an intersex person. The other hard part, was that this person didn\u2019t \u201clook\u201d female or male.\n\nThis person took me 40 minutes to wax, mostly because their anatomy was harder to work with.  I feel awful even typing this because I sound so rude but I have no other way to describe it. Men\u2019s waxes sometimes take longer because their scrotum is more sensitive and we have to prepare the skin better with the kind of wax we use. This person\u2019s (appearing to be) outer labias had skin that was similar - it was wrinkled. The micropenis or clitoris was harder to work around. Again, I am not a medical professional, just a safe person who deals with peoples body\u2019s, so I do not know what or how to describe these anyway else. I am really sorry if I sound stupid. \n\nAnyway, before I left the room I let them know that the next time they book, just to book for the 45 minute brazilian and not the 30. I noticed the look of confusion on their face and explained that everybody has different anatomy and some people just need some extra time. This was me trying to be sensitive to how they identify. (I also was thinking about my coworkers, specifically the ones who are not signed off on men\u2019s waxes, because we wait to train those until they are completely ready. I didn\u2019t want them to be booked and not feel prepared for this person.) \n\nThey pretty much replied \u201cYou want me to book a service meant for a man?\u201d and I said, \u201cNo, I want you to book a service where you are taken care of, comfortably, in a allotted time that works for us as well\u201d. They were visibly upset that I was saying this and have now contacted my boss stating that they felt unsafe and judged by me. I feel really upset. I had a great convo with them during the wax, I thought I built trust, and it was thrown away. I do not judge peoples body\u2019s. It\u2019s part of my job to help people realize that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the way they look. In their description to my boss they wrote, \u201c..made me embarrassed of my identity.\u201d \n\nI have seen HUNDREDS of people and I am now so worried that I waxed someone whose anatomy was just a bit different. I tried to handle it but I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t even know if I am making sense right now. My boss seems understanding of my situation but also so disappointed in me. I don\u2019t want to make people feel this way, but I was also trying to think of my coworkers who might be taken back. I don\u2019t know. AITAH?",

She started our relationship going to the gym and meal prepping; something she enjoyed and found made her stable. I wanted to go to the gym everyday and eat healthy, something I had been working on to get back into and doing in the past. I'm currently down 55 pounds from when we first started talking.  \n\nHer last relationship, and only relationship, was with a POS Manchild who was abusive. It's was a few years before that relationship ended and her and I began dating. \n\nEvery time we've argued, I'm always the one at fault. Even when I know it's not my fault, I put myself in her shoes and apologize. I can think of only two times in a year she has owned up to being wrong, but mostly blames me for things that, in my opinion, are not actually because of me. She's expressed frustrations with me bigger things like previously  sleeping too much, not following through, and a host of smaller things.  \n\nRecently we started going to the gym every morning. I've been waking up at 6:00 a.m. to go without problem. We've built a routine in the evenings that's I've had to practically beg her to do. I've expressed it's the only way I can function is to go to bed at a decent hour and get 7 hours of good sleep. She can function on 5 and doesn't seem to understand why I need so much. \n\nThe break-up stems from last night where she told me she was done and checked out. And I explained and expressed to her, after she said some very hurtful things, that I've done everything she's asked. But it's never good enough. \n\nI've told her we're going to the gym, yet she says, \"it's only been 4 days in a row.\" I tell her I've done all the household chores in addition to my physically labor intensive job. It's not good enough. She said it's taken a year and that I've stepped on her and don't care about her by not doing everything she's asked, which I have it's just taken time. \n\nIve:\n-Completely changed my diet to 100% healthy foods\n-Done everything she's asked me to do in regards to making her feel loved.\n-Cut my sleep patterns back from 10-11 hours a day to 7 \n-Keep our apartment in prestine clean (she has OCD) condition \n-Busted butt to make sure her financial needs are met (I pay the entire rent $1600. \n-Quit dipping and am done with nicotine \n-Lost 55 pounds by a year of healthy habits. \n\nToday we woke up and went to the gym like normal. After getting home I made her and I breakfast and I didn't feel good so I laid down (I didn't have work today). I ended up falling asleep for 2 hours. I didn't get much sleep last night because of the argument (about 5 hours if that.) When I woke up, she said she's done. She said she's done because it's a slap in the face to take a nap when she's told me that she sees it as lazy. Even though 95% of everything we've worked so hard for and the routines we've set are in place. \n\nAm I delusional in thinking she's not seeing it clearly? Am I at fault? \n\nHow do I help make her see how far I've come and how much effort I've put in? How do I help her understand that I've overcome so much and set so many healthy habits that me falling asleep isn't purposely a slap in the face to her? \n\nThank you. ",

      "selftext": "I live a few houses down from a house my ex owns. We have a 10 year old daughter together. He only stays at that home during the day whenever he has my daughter due to her school. Otherwise he lives with his wife 45 min away. \n\n9 months ago I had noticed, whenever I would get home from work, that there was a different vehicle at his home. Whatever he does is none of my business as long as it does not affect my daughter. Every Monday and Friday that vehicle would be there. Me knowing her father very well, I knew he was cheating on his wife, my daughter\u2019s step mother. My thought process was, my daughter doesn\u2019t know, therefore I\u2019m not getting involved. \n\n3 months later, my daughter sits me down and tells me that she knows that her father is in a relationship with another woman. (My daughter maybe 10 years old, but she is extremely smart). She begins to tell me that she has gone to lunch with this other woman, she texts back and forth with this other woman (bc she is a hair stylist and makeup artist), and the last time she got a haircut, this other woman was the one that cut her hair. She also tells me that whenever her step mother is not around, her dad calls the other woman from his work phone and calls her \u201cLove\u201d and has my daughter talk to the other woman on the phone. I was shocked! I didn\u2019t know how to respond to my daughter, as she is still young, and just told her that I would talk to her dad.\n\nOn our next child exchange, i spoke with her dad and I told him that he needed to stop bringing this other woman around my daughter and have them stop communicating with each other. I advised him that I did not want my daughter growing up thinking it is ok for anyone to cheat while they are in a relationship! I also told him that he is threatening and playing with her mental stability and behavior like that around my daughter I will not tolerate at all! He agreed with my concerns. \n\nHer father is a compulsive liar. He promised my daughter that he would no longer \u201cbe friends\u201d with the other woman but that was a lie. When my daughter walks home from the bus stop, she can see the other woman\u2019s car at her father\u2019s house. \n\nSo much more has happened since then but I will make it short. When my daughter is with me, I don\u2019t bring up her dad. The only time he gets brought up is when she brings him up. I will allow her to express her feelings to me and I am all ears to hear her concerns. \n\nAnyways, a week ago my daughter comes out and tells me that she no longer want to stay with her dad every other week anymore. I asked her why? She tells me that bc she is tired of her dad lying to her. She also told me that she wants to talk to her dad and give him an ultimatum: either divorce his wife and stay with the other woman or leave the other woman and stay with his wife. She also feels obligated to tell her step mom what her dad has been up to. All she wants is for her dad to stop having 2 relationships and be a good father to her but all he keeps doing is lying to her. I was very speechless. She deserves to express herself, but I feel as her mother, before my daughter does something so drastic, that I should intervene and tell his wife myself to protect my daughter from any potential retaliation that could potentially happen. \n\nI have already tried talking to her father over 5 times about how his actions are affecting my daughter and if he doesn\u2019t stop with his deceitfulness and lies, he would risk losing his daughter per her choice. He has not listened to me at all, even with all the warnings I have given him bc of my daughter expressing her own personal concerns to me. \n\nWould I be the AH if I tell his wife that he has been cheating on her this year? \n\nI need to do something bc I am now looking for a therapist for my daughter bc this is now affecting her emotionally.

I politely showed them my ticket, expecting them to move, but the mom asked if I could take the daughter's seat further back because her daughter was a huge fan. I hesitated because I\u2019d been looking forward to this view and experience for so long.\n\n  \nFeeling a bit guilty but firm, I explained how much this concert meant to me and opted to keep my seat. They moved without making a scene, but I noticed glares from some people nearby and felt somewhat judged. As the concert went on, I tried to focus on the show, but it gnawed at me. Was I selfish for standing my ground? I didn't want to ruin their night, but this was a big deal for me, too. Thoughts?",

      "selftext": "Last May, me (29M) and my wife (30F) were wanting to move from Vermont to the American Southwest. Our budget was 550,000 dollars and we're wanting to start a family by 2030. We eventually find a beautiful southwestern style home in New Mexico. A 2 story, 3 bedroom, 1.5 bath home for 533,000 dollars built in 1919. It's an incredibly charming place with it's white stucco exterior, red tile roof, black wrought iron lighting fixtures, an overall beauty.\n\nWhile we were looking at the house, the realtor brought me aside and told me that back in the early 1940s a man had died under suspicious circumstances on the back patio. She showed me a specific corner outside between the outdoor oven and an exterior wall where he was found, she also pointed out a groove in the wall where the bullet had scraped it. Which appeared to have been deep enough to leave a noticeable crevice and withstand years of repainting, despite being 80ish years\n\nI honestly felt like she was just making stuff up as she went along (Why would you tell a customer this?), as if she wanted to reserve the house for someone else. I pushed her story to the back of my mind and continued looking around the house. We decided to buy it. I didn't bother telling my wife about the possible fable. We bought the house on September 14th and it's been ours ever since.\n\nDespite our house being located in a rural area, one of our neighbors figured to introduce himself, a nice older gentlemen, maybe in his 60s. He described his life in the area and how he's been there since the 70s. Just a genuinely kind man. I had to use the bathroom, so I excused myself. When I came back 3 minutes later, my wife was staring daggers at me, I wasn't sure what her problem was until after the man left.\n\nIt turns out our neighbor had exposed the history of the house to her. Especially the 1942 murder of a young man on our back patio. I then told her that the realtor described the same event to me. This infuriated her even more. My wife was seriously shaken by this, and despite there being no real evidence besides word of mouth, she decided to leave and spend the night in a hotel.\n\nThe next morning she came back and said I was such an douche for not telling her. I personally don't understand how it's that scary as this happened more than 80 years ago. It's not like the bl00d is still there. She then said how it's probably haunted and everything, this caused me to roll my eyes as I'm a firm believer that once you pass its lights out. I believe in Ellen getting her show back before the paranormal being a real thing. I truly felt the whole thing was pure BS, so why bother telling her.\n\nAITA?\n\nEDIT: I was the one to buy the house. She gave nothing towards it.\n\nEDIT 2: I looked up what states require realtors to disclose death, but New Mexico is not one of them.",

Quoting him \u201cwe are doing everything you do dating and in a relationship, but without the title.\u201d he has met part of my family and my friends however, he never introduced me to any of his friends or family saying he needs to be in a serious relationship before that to happen. unfortunately one of my meds counteracted my bc, (was not antibiotics or medication commonly known to affect birth control) my pcm didn\u2019t even know that it was a possibility without doing some research but now we are pregnant. Last night he dropped a bomb on me that he can no longer see me because he feels like if we get into an official relationship he is only doing it for the child. Nor can he be friends with me or hang out with me or anything with me. He is essentially abandoning me at six weeks pregnant. He stated he has no responsibility to me while I am pregnant or to help me unless it is a serious matter. His only responsibility will be to the baby when it comes. He still wants to be in the delivery room, have an option in the baby\u2019s name and get 50-50 custody. A few of his comments that really stuck at me last night  Me: \u201cwe are pregnant, I need help, I don\u2019t want to do this by myself emotionally and physically this way will be draining at least be my friend.\u201d\nFather: \u201cno, you are pregnant. I will be there when the child is born. I owe you nothing.\u201d\nMe: \u201c aren\u2019t you gonna wanna feel a child kicking in me and all the other wonders of pregnancy?\u201d\nFather: \u201c no this wasn\u2019t planned so I don\u2019t want to\u201d\nMe: \u201c what if I get too big and I can\u2019t tie my own shoes and I need help with daily stuff\u201d\nFather:  \u201c buy slip on shoes\u201d\nI completely understand the relationship aspect of his statement but I feel like he is completely abandoning me and just wants to step back in when the baby is born. How do I trust or let somebody in when they just left us?\nMore so how do I let someone see me give birth and such a vulnerable position who just walked away from me at six weeks? We are not married. I legally do not have to put his name on the birth certificate and then he would have to petition the courts for paternal rights. Also, I don\u2019t know any of his family or where they live. I don\u2019t want my newborn out of my sight with strangers if he can abandon me how do I know he\u2019s gonna bring back the baby. \n\nSidenote: he wants to coparent in the future and have a flexible visiting schedule due to his job.

His whole living space (the whole apartment except my room) is dirty, dusty, and just a giant mess. I told him how excited I will be when I can finally have a clean apartment and it hurt his feelings and he\u2019s been upset with me since. \n\nA little backstory. \n\nMy mom moved in with us when she got sick and I took care of her for took care of her for 12 years. Shortly after she passed, he moved in with his dad with the intention to move in with friends later because I moved to another city closer to work and he didn\u2019t want to go. I got a one bedroom apartment and furnished it with all new furniture and it was so cute and clean. \n\nThe situation with his dad didn\u2019t work out because he\u2019s trans and his dad is a homophobic asshole. We knew that going in, but he wanted to stay there to be closer to his friends. \n\nWhen that didn\u2019t work out, he moved in with me for a \u201cshort time\u201d until he could get a job and save up to move out on his own. \n\nBut nowadays kids can\u2019t really move out and live on their own because they can\u2019t make enough money to support themselves. And I was fine with him living with me because I understood that. Many times I offered to get a bigger place in hopes that would contain his messiness, but he insisted he was moving \u201csoon.\u201d\n\nWell, he\u2019s been here for about 2.5 years and honestly, I cannot keep up with his level of filth. Not to mention, he\u2019s always got friends over and I have no peace. \n\nI work 60-80 hours a week and (60% of the time from home) and I just want to chill when I\u2019m done. \n\nHe\u2019s moving out at the end of the month and as he\u2019s been packing, I\u2019ve been cleaning out cupboards and closets. I love him but can\u2019t wait till he\u2019s on his own and I can do a deep, deep clean, or pay someone to do it! \n\nWhile he\u2019s been here, I tried having conversations with him and he would keep things sorta clean for a while and then stop. With the amount of hours I work and the fact that I have MS and love him dearly, I just got sick and tired of getting on his ass about it. \n\nThe place is a disaster. I literally live in my room and either pick up takeout or eat things that I can microwave because I hate using the kitchen anymore. \n\nLike I said, he\u2019s moving out at the end of the month and this mama has been happily helping him pack and purchase things for his new place. I\u2019m even giving him most of my furniture that I bought when I moved in. It\u2019s stained and a little tattered now, but he and his roommates are happy to have it because they are starting with literally nothing. \n\nHe\u2019s really excited to move out and be on his own, but I think I hurt his feelings with my level of excitement. LOL I love him dearly, but I\u2019m 57 and have been taking care of people since I was 18. \n\nI\u2019m so ready to live alone, with things the way I like them, in peace. \n\nThat said, I will miss the little shit.

      "selftext": "Hello all,\n\nTL;DR Am I the asshole if I block my father out of my life completely? He cheated on my mom, contributed to a very traumatic divorce and childhood, although he's been helping me and my sister financially.\n\nThe long story: \n\nMy father cheated on my mom after 13 years of marriage with a colleague for reasons I will never know (quite possibly money and the fact that both of them are very controlling and potentilly narcisistic).\n\nThis happened when I was around 8 years old (sister was 5) and the whole divorce and custody process took around 3-4 years to complete. \n\nLeading up to that, he blocked the phone (it was an old analog phone) from dialing a specific character so I couldn't call his cellphone or my mom's or my grandparents (who basically raised us and lived in another city) when me and my sister were left alone at home because he was chasing his new woman and my mom was being the detective trying to find where he was. I remember spending time standing by the window watching the cars and waiting for my mom's car and worrying endlessly that no one would come back home for us.\n\nDuring this time, my parents had actual physical fights (meaning hitting each other) in front of me and my sister (who's three years younger than me). I got slapped by my father over stupid things I did but didn't know better at the time (killing a fish in our acquarium which I thought was attacking other fish and represented the woman he was cheating on my mom with). I got slapped so hard another time my glasses flew across the room. And the other time for absolutely no reason when my mom brought us to a rendevous point for our father to pick us up during a family trip with my maternal side of the family. My sister and I didn't want to go, but I guess nobody really cared about what we wanted.\n\nDuring this time, my sister and I unfortunately got involved in the custody process and had to handwrite a letter to the court saying we want to stay together (the court was trying to break us apart) and with our mom. My father threatened me and my sister that he would kill our mom if we didn't do what he says. He also forced me and my sister to sleep in his bedroom after a fight with mom and prevented us from getting out after one of such threats. \n\nOne time, after he lost the custody battle, he came home and broke all the plates and glasses in the kitchen when no one was home. I was the first person to arrive and seeing this, I was so scared I thought a thief had broken into our home, and went and stayed at a neighbor until my mom showed up.\n\nDuring the final stages of the divorce, my mom would prevent him from getting in the house by leaving the key in the lock and barring the door. But he would keep banging on the door, yelling that he's going to bring the door down while me and my sister were both being terrified of what was going to happen if he somehow managed to get in. This happened so many times, I've lost count.\n\nDuring that trip that I got slapped, after he picked us up (which really felt like kidnapping), he prevented us from contacting our mom for the entirety of the time we were forced to spend with him. Then, another time, while we were staying at my grandparents' house, he came in and tried to force us to go on a trip with him, but we were holding onto our grandparents because we didn't want to go. He kidnapped my sister who was much younger and smaller than me at the time, and even though my mom and grandfather tried to chase him to the train station, they couldn't get my sister back. He returned with her, and she was safe, but the damage was already done.\n\nAfter the divorce, we moved out and changed where we lived to the other city my grandparents lived in. But my father knew where we went to at school, and he would show up there and try to meet us. But we didn't want to meet him, and my mom was terrified that he would kidnap us again for good, so we would have to ask the principal to call our mom, tell her to come pick us up through the backdoor and hope against hope that he wouldn't see us or catch us before mom showed up. When we actually managed to get home safe, he would call us or our mom repeatedly leaving angry voicemails with lots of swearing. It was super terrifying and embarassing and it kept going on until I went to college.\n\nDuring all these years, he's been helping me and my sister financially by paying child support to my mom; and also giving me money for things (certificates, immigration, downpayment for a car loan, a safety deposit for a house I was renting, etc) which if he hadn't given me, I wouldn't have been able to afford and my mom wouldn't have been able to help me with either. In return for all of this, I have had maintained contact with him, seen him in person multiple times, and basically tried to repay some of what he's done financially by helping him and his 3rd wife when I could do something for them and they couldn't without my help.\n\nThere's a lot more to unpack here, but finally after 20 years, going to therapy for 5 years, and some other things happenening, I'm realizing that all this time I was angry and hateful toward him just for him betraying my mom and never for all the abuse and fear he made me and my sister go through. \n\nAm I the asshole if I block him out of my life completely even though he's been helping me and my sister financially?\n\nThank you for reading through this horrible column of text, and please let me know if you have any questions in the comments. I'll try my best to answer them. ",

      "selftext": "I met my first husband when we were both sixteen. We got married at nineteen after discovering I was pregnant, and I had our son, Adam, when I was twenty years old. However, just two months later, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and passed away six months after that. It was the most traumatic experience of my life. One moment, we were a happy new family, and the next, he was taken from us.\n\nI need to mention that my husband came from a well-off family and was the only son of his parents, who had tragically passed away in a car crash a couple of years before we met. He wanted to change his will but lacked the strength to do so at that time and was worried about Adam. I didn't want him to be concerned about those matters, so I promised him that I would leave the money to Adam in a trust that he could access when he turns eighteen, which I followed through on.\n\nThe next two years were challenging for me. I struggled with alcoholism while my parents took care of Adam. Eventually, I got pregnant from one of my many one-night stands and had my second son, Ben, who is now 26. Ben saved my life; I gave up drinking for him and have now been sober for 26 years. I also found a job as a bus driver.\n\nIt wasn't easy, but it was the best time of my life. My sons were best friends, we were a close-knit family, and I was truly happy. However, everything changed when Adam turned eighteen. He gained access to the trust, which made our financial situation much more manageable. Without me even saying anything, he informed Ben that he would cover the cost of his college tuition.\n\nI sat Ben down to explain that Adam's late father had left him money, and I would gladly offer him the same support if I could. He said he understood and that he wouldn't need it, then asked if he could go to his room, which frustrated me. He is closed off and proud; in that regard, he resembles my husband more than Adam ever did.\n\nA couple of years later, he got accepted into medical school, and his brother offered to help him again, but he declined the offer. I thought that perhaps if I took out a loan to assist him, he might appreciate it, but he insisted he didn't need it. He had applied for some student aid and planned to borrow the rest. No matter what his brother or I said, he wouldn\u2019t change his mind. So, he left that year, and I haven't seen my son since.\n\nHe chose a college on the other side of the country, and there was never a real argument about it. As time went on, he started to respond to my messages less frequently, offering excuses for why he couldn't come home during the holidays. Eventually, he stopped responding altogether and changed his phone number. I tried to locate him on social media, but I don't think he has any accounts, and I haven't been able to get in touch with him.\n\nThis year, I ran into an old friend of his. We chatted for a bit, and I learned that they were still in touch. I asked for his phone number, but the friend refused to share it with me. To be honest, I ended up begging a little. Eventually, he offered to give me his email address, but only if I promised never to reveal who provided it.\n\nI sent him an email expressing how much I missed him, how eager I was to see him, and how often he was on my mind. Part of me dreamed about him returning and being my son again. For months, I received no response, until a couple of weeks ago. He finally emailed me back, asking me to stop contacting him. He said he was tired of me pretending to love him. He mentioned that his aunt had told him I was the one who left Adam all that money. He had grown up happy and never minded using Adam's clothes and toys because he believed that was all they had. But now, he understood that I only cared about Adam.\n\nI won't go into detail about what he called me in that email, but I never expected him to feel such hatred toward me. That night, I came very close to having a drink again. It was only thanks to my fantastic sponsor that I didn\u2019t relapse.\n\nThe next day, I called my sister and asked her how she could do this to me and why she was trying to destroy my family. We had a big argument, and she has been trying to contact me for the past week, but I refuse to talk to her. Yesterday, her husband messaged me, telling me to stop blaming his wife for my mistakes. He said I needed to take responsibility for my choice to give everything to my firstborn. He mentioned that if my belief that I did the right thing helped me sleep at night, that was fine, but it wasn't their fault that I had neglected one of my children.\n\nI responded to him with a message telling him to go screw himself. I heard from my mother that he left the house after my sister discovered what he had done, and my sister was understandably angry with him. However, I don\u2019t care about that. She told my child only half the story, which made him believe that I didn\u2019t care about him. I\u2019m not sure I can forgive her for that.\n\nShe is my best friend, but I wonder if her husband is right. Maybe I did wrong by Ben when I gave his brother his inheritance.\n\n",

      "selftext": "I need to know if I\u2019m in the wrong here. I have always been a difficult child for my parents. When I was young, I was bullied by a cousin of mine who would tell me we were playing a game of pretend fight, and then my cousin would proceed to physically abuse me because in this game of fight he was much stronger and older. He would punch, kick, and do things that hurt. The most painful thing he would do was push a finger against the middle of my chest as hard as he could. Usually it was not bad enough to leave marks, but many times it got bad enough that I would be crying in pain. I don\u2019t know that my parents knew the extent of the abuse, but I know that they knew that some level of abuse was happening. Despite this level of abuse, I was always taught that family was the most important thing and that they were my cousins so we would continue to spend time with them. As I got older my cousin also became emotionally abusive. \n\nBecause of this, I have always had a chip on my shoulder and I have not tolerated any kind of abuse. Many times growing up, if I felt threatened, I would defend myself, usually with excessive force. This included if kids were smaller than me. To give one example, on a trip to visit really extended family, a child came after me when I was about 12 or 13 and started hitting me with a rather large toy car and I pushed him away. There was no acknowledgment by anyone in the group that I was being attacked by a child with a toy, I just remember being told I was a bully and that I needed to be better. I remember being in huge trouble the rest of the day with my parents and extended family because of this. I spent the entire day in shame, but feeling like it was only partially deserved and I always felt I had been betrayed because my mom would always rush to the defense of the younger child immediately so she wouldn\u2019t look bad in front of family and friends. This is not the only time it happened and my father would react in a similar way. After these episodes would happen, I would be made to feel I was a bully, even though almost every time I felt like I had felt threatened. I never felt like similar things happened with my sisters.\n\nWhen I was in K-12 school, my mom in particular, would always judge my grades really harshly. I was always an above average kid, but am the son of a customer service rep at car dealers, and a stay at home mom, who did some secretary work until I was about 2 or 3. This probably doesn\u2019t matter but we are Latinos. Despite this my mom in particular was very demanding that I get top grades. When I was in first, second, and third grade, I would give my best effort in everything, but on occasion would get C\u2019s because despite my full engagement, I was either bored or overwhelmed. \n\nMy mom would punish me and not let me play video games, which was what I most enjoyed to do for fun, for months at a time (until I got the next report card) when I\u2019d get C\u2019s. Sometimes she was a little lenient and she\u2019d put me kind of on probation, but this became a recurring thing. My problem from Kindergarten to 3rd grade was not lack of effort, but instead not understanding where effort was best allocated for the best grades.\n\nIn fourth grade, I decided effort was not rewarded, so I stopped trying meaning I stopped doing my homework. I would do my homework in school as class was going on because I wanted to go home and play with Legos or video games if I wasn\u2019t punished. I didn\u2019t want to do homework, I would already spend enough time at school doing work. I was always a great test taker and I understood the concepts taught in school very well. I would regularly get As, Bs, and Cs despite putting all my effort into being ready for tests. To give an idea of how well I understood the material, when I was in 5th grade, my last year in elementary school, I took Florida\u2019s standardized test, the FCAT, and scored the highest of anyone in my entire school, including kids who were in special classes for gifted children which my teachers had talked about me going to, but never did the paperwork for me to do so. I continued this from 4th grade onward. Anytime I got a C my mom would put me in the mentioned probation and would then proceed to not let me play video games until the next semester if I came up short, but at that point I stopped caring. I made it through all of middle and high school, with this attitude and it worked. I graduated high school with a 3.29 GPA, which while it was not by any means perfect is perfectly respectable for a person who mostly took honors classes.\n\nWhile my sisters were in school they got Cs in classes and I expected my mother to treat them similarly. My mother would make excuses for them and say they are trying their best and they just can\u2019t get there. This was infuriating to me, as at least when I was in Kindergarten to 3rd grade, I actually had given my full effort, but she would punish me in a way that I thought was cruel as I enjoyed video games more than any other activity I could do.\n\nOnce I was done with school, I did some religious service for two years. I was only allowed to communicate with my family by email once per week and had two phone calls per year on Christmas and Mother\u2019s Day. My family did support me here and I appreciated them for doing so. This is an expectation in my faith, which we have been members of my whole life. The time I spent was in Peru, I know my mom tried to make some friends during this period of time. When I got back however they expected me to quickly reintegrate back into my previous life and be who I had been. My father would make fun of me because of some of the phrases I\u2019d say and make it sound like some of the habits I had developed in my time there were a bad thing. My sister did the same type of religious service and went to Brazil, and my parents actively sought out friendships and made friends with tons of Brazilian people. When she came back she was allowed to transition her life without crazy pressure to be more like us again immediately.\n\nAfter returning home from my service, I was highly motivated to keep my life moving, get married, do some schooling and start a career. I got married pretty young (this is typical in my faith) worked hard and got a Master\u2019s degree in 3 years and started working in my career. I move out of my parents house when I was 22, and returned for 2 weeks at one time when I was between jobs. I have worked hard not to be a burden to them. My sisters have not done the same, my sisters attempted college and failed miserably. They would fail very basic courses like physics 101, chemistry 101 and most basic math courses. \n\nBoth my sisters got married, and one had an ugly divorce with a daughter. During that period of time, her ex-husband threatened me once and my parents got angry at me for asking my sister why her husband thought it was ok to threaten me, we got into a swearing match but my dad told me that it was my responsibility to not let arguments get like that. There was no repudiation to my sister about her behavior, even though her husband threatened me, and she started swearing at me.\n\nAs time has gone by, my parents have served as baby-sitting for my sisters\u2019 kids and have had my sisters\u2019 live in their house for really extended periods of time. Both of my sisters are currently married and leech off my parent\u2019s as much as possible. I occasionally ask my parents to watch my kids at night when I want to take my wife on a date. This happens like once every month or two.\n\nRecently, I was asked to help my father bring my grandfather into town as my grandfather has been incapable for awhile of taking care of himself as he is too old and has serious dementia issues. I am a CPA and was asked to do this during the busiest time of the year.\n\nDuring this trip, I told my dad that when he dies he should give my inheritance to my sisters instead of me since neither of them have a house that they own. He told me that he was already planning on doing that as it was what my mom\u2019s father had done for my mom\u2019s sister when he died. He left my mom a tiny amount and gave my aunt his entire interest in a house they owned together and all of his assets. While I was planning on giving it anyway, it hurt me deeply that my father would not have the courtesy to ask me if that was ok. I own a house, rental properties, have a high-paying job and am well for myself. Regardless of all this, I am the result of my choices and have consistently made the most advantageous choice I can to get my wife and kids ahead. With those choices have come large sacrifices of time and effort that my sisters have not made. Whether or not they get that money, should have been my choice and I was going to do it. By not giving me the choice I feel my father is punishing me for making the right choices.\n\nRecently, at my parent\u2019s house, my sister\u2019s tone towards my wife, who is the most reasonable person I know, while my wife was asking her daughter to calm down because she was yelling at my son and wife since she wanted a particular seat where my son had sat, made my wife feel insulted enough that she, without telling anyone, left the house. When I realized what had happened, I told my kids we needed to go and left my parents house.\n\nMy parents wanted to know what had happened and I told my mom my sisters behavior towards my wife wasn\u2019t acceptable and that we shouldn\u2019t be treated like outsiders. My mom says she treats us all the same and is always helping all of us. Referring to how much more her and my dad help my sisters, I simply said mom you take care of my kids every once in a while. She got upset and we haven\u2019t talked since. I have made a determination that I don\u2019t really want a relationship with any of them. My parents give their all to my sisters, I am left with the scraps and I\u2019m tired of being treated like my wife, kids and I don\u2019t belong.",

Although my home life is toxic (just my dad and me), I stayed so I could pay off school and did so within a year. My dad (68m) was gracious enough to offer to help me pay on my loans, but it has turned into something he uses as a way to put me down. \n\nMy dad is someone who would do anything for me, but also uses his kindness as a way to control me. He will offer favors and then turn around and call me selfish for accepting the next time he gets angry. He can be extremely abusive in general and that is when he tends to throw things like this back in my face. I\u2019m finally leaving next month. \n\nHere\u2019s the deal - He gave me about $5,000 to put towards school over the course of the year it took me to pay off my loans. Obviously, that\u2019s a huge deal and I\u2019ve always been very appreciative of his help. I told him multiple times that I know it\u2019s not his responsibility and he assured me he wanted to do it. I tried to deny his help multiple times but he insisted. \n\nAs of late, things have been really bad at home and he\u2019s been bringing up the school money more during arguments. Out of no where he will go on rants about paying for my schooling and how he was kind enough to do that. This is usually in response to me asking him to not talk to me in a disrespectful tone or manner. \n\nMy mom died a couple of months ago and I\u2019m selling her vehicle for $7,000. I told him today that he will get $5,000 out of that as a pay back for school. I mentioned that I\u2019m tired of this situation and I can sense his resentment. \n\nHe flipped out on me and told me I was a hateful person with something wrong with me.

      "selftext": "\nI (19f) have been dating my boyfriend (20m) for a little over a year. Recently I\u2019ve noticed he acts a little weird around my sister (24f). He\u2019s met my entire family (I have 3 other younger siblings) and he\u2019s always been super nice to my whole family so I never thought much of him being very nice to my sister. Since I do live with her, he\u2019s been around her a lot more than the rest of my family. A few events as of recently have made me question if he\u2019s TOO nice to her.\n\nIt started when he would come over and always wanted to say hi to her and asked if she had anything going on, he would be very invested in her stories or drama. He would ask me about her drama or life issues even when she wasn\u2019t around. Another thing I found odd was anytime she walked past my room he would immediately whip his head around and look at her. This mostly weirded me out when she would walk out of the bathroom in just a towel and he would stare. \n\nThen he started being a bit too nice to her (imo). Anything she needed he would offer to get or bring to her, if she needed help he would help her, etc. Now it has gotten worse. He sometimes asks to come over to my house and if I mention my sister won\u2019t be there he makes an excuse that he can\u2019t come anymore. He has her phone number in his phone and has her name saved as a nickname for her as well.  The other day I mentioned I needed to take something of hers I left at his house back home, I forgot it and said I would get it next time. He said he would bring it instead, drives an hour out of his way to come inside and give it to her. When he walked inside I was talking to him and she walked downstairs and he cut me off to look at her and say he brought it back for her and make conversation with her. Also I think it\u2019s worth mentioning, compared to me, my sister is much more of his type then I am. \n\n(A little context, I do have trust issues from being cheated on in the past so please don\u2019t come for me if this post is me being insane)",

      "selftext": "Fair warning; this is a long one, I apologize, but need some input. Summary of a 7 year relationship incoming.\n\nI (26/f) have been married to my husband (28/m) for 4 1/2 years, in a relationship for 7 years total. While the relationship started great (2017), that only lasted for about a year. We met on Tinder, talked for 2 months, met in person and immediately became exclusive. I was 19, in college, and had never had a serious boyfriend. He was 21, just left a 4 year relationship where he had been living with her, and was living with his parents when we met. At 8 months into the relationship we had to move in together due to my schooling causing financial stress and his living situation. We moved in with the agreement that we would both work and pay half of the bills. I thought this was a great idea as he had told me he was paying for an apartment alone with his ex. (this was a lie, that I discovered years later, they lived with her parents and he paid for food.) I was in school full time while working as many hours as I could to pay my half. He was working a fast food job part time and didn't look for other work (he was not in college and never attended).\n\n2018: After 3 months living together, we were thinking about getting engaged. I bought the ring, as he wasn't working as many hours and couldn't afford it. The ring wasn't outrageous in price, as I couldn't afford much either, it was under $1,000. He promised he would make up buying my own ring to me with the proposal. The ring sat in the apartment for weeks and I thought he was planning something special. When one night, he proposed in the living room of our apartment, no speech, could hardly remember my full name, and didn't get down on one knee. He just sat beside me, stumbled over my name, and asked me to marry him. I said yes. At the time I wasn't disappointed with the proposal, as I truly loved him and thought he was just too nervous to do it publicly.\n\n2019: A month after our engagement, he got fired. With the craziness of losing his job, he forgot my birthday and I thought it was an accident, but it was a red flag. For the remainder of my schooling, he told me he was applying to several jobs with no luck securing one... From Jan-Aug, I was in school, working two part time jobs, and paying all the bills alone, while he sat in the apartment and played video games. I was still the one to do most of the cooking and cleaning, unless I encouraged him to help me once I started. After I left college, we couldn't afford to stay in the city we were in with only my income. We had to move back in with my parents for about 3 months. During that time, I was still the only one working to secure income and looking for a new apartment.\n\nI managed to secure us an apartment in a shared home in my hometown and he was able to secure another fast food job. While I launched my own business and worked part time, he was also working and contributing to the household for the first time in almost a year. It was the first Christmas that we could both buy each other gifts and actually celebrate a holidays without financial stress. It was great and the first holiday that felt like we were a little family. At the time we had two cats and had just adopted a third as a Christmas gift to each other. We bought his wedding band and I purchased that one as well. It was more expensive than mine, and he lost it within a year of the wedding.\n\n2020: Shortly after Christmas, I got extremely sick with a mystery illness that was never diagnosed. (rapid weight loss, constant exhaustion, severe stomach and joint pains, and more that I won't go into.) I knew with his income alone we couldn't pay our bills. So I pushed through the pain and continued working. This was also the same month COVID hit. My work got reduced but with him being in fast food his shifts stayed the same. However, he started call in constantly and missing multiple shifts a week. On my birthday that year he was sick and I thought that was why he forgot to say happy birthday until I reminded him.\n\nBy February, he was unemployed again due to calling in. I was the only one working and we were a month away from our wedding. After he got fired, our wedding venue had to temporarily close due to COVID and we had a makeshift wedding outdoors in winter weather with 10 people in attendance. The wedding, mixed with COVID caused a lot of drama with his family and my own extended family and that caused even more tension in our marriage. We tried to replan at our venue in 2021 but after all the family drama, it just wasn't worth it. I never got a real engagement, a real wedding, or a honeymoon... Which I know isn't a massive deal and at the time I was more than okay with it all, because I had the love of my life by my side.. and we couldn't afford it.\n\nBy May of 2020 we were in the same financial position as our last apartment and again, resorted to moving in with my parents. During this time, I had a small business that was bringing in quite a bit of money and working a part time job. He was unemployed from about Feb-Jun and then got a position part time. I managed to save up enough money, and got us into another apartment in my hometown.\n\n2021: The apartment is huge, cost effective, and a decent landlord to deal with. When we moved into the new place (oct 2020), it felt like a fresh start. We were both employed, my business was taking off, we were talking about children and then, he started calling in again... Within a few months of being in the apartment, he lost another job. He promised me he would have a new job within a month. My birthday past again that year and he forgot and used his unemployment as the reason for not doing anything when I reminded him. He didn't get another job for a year. During all this time I was still incredibly sick, losing weight, and trying to keep motivated while being in and out of the hospital.\n\nWe started to incur debt and I wasn't able to afford the rent alone. I had to rely on my parents a lot to save my ass and I am forever grateful for them. I had to get credit cards which built more debt and in turn made the situation worse. While I cried and pleaded with him to apply for jobs anywhere to help us get out of the hole we were in, he was picky with applications and wouldn't take any minimum wage jobs. With how much I was working with how sick I was I couldn't keep up with the house chores. I asked him to at least keep the house clean while I worked to pay the bills and tried to recover. He would do the dishes once after a fight broke out, but eventually I didn't have the energy in me to fight and the apartment became a dump. It was impossible for me to keep up with. It eventually got so bad, I was embarrassed to ask my family members or friends for help and it added more stress to the marriage and made me feel secluded from any kind of community. I was feeling incredibly alone and neglected by him and made that clear. I asked for more help, more attention, more affection, someone to vent to. Every time I brought it up, I was told I was nagging him and he was trying.\n\nDuring this time, many fights broke out where I was told I was the reason he was unhappy and that if I would just cheer up maybe he'd be able to make be happy. This was the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I set very clear boundaries, told him I expected him to pull his weight, help clean, at least get a part time job, and treat me kindly or I would be leaving. This was the first of many times he cried, promised me he'd change, that I meant the world to him, and he loved me enough to try more. The trying would happen, I do have to give him some credit, but within a week, he would be back to playing video games all day, ignoring me when I spoke to him or giving me an annoyed 'what?'. A job was also not something he got until November of 2022.\n\nFrom 2022-2023 he held down a part time job making minimum wage. It was good, we were able to pay all our bills for a year, we weren't struggling to afford food, and our animals were spoiled. However, he and I were still having constant arguments about household chores, how he was treating me, and how often we were physically affectionate. In December of 2023, we got a marriage 'fix it' puppy (I was smart enough to not have a fix it baby...) At the time I thought it would prepare us for taking care of something with more needs, that requires patience and training. The week we got the pup, I had to travel for work for two nights. I called him to see the pup a few times and things seemed fine. When I got home, he was irritated and the first thing he said was 'I think we need to get rid of the dog, I can't handle her.' I was devastated. That pup is everything I ever wanted and more, she may be a handful, but she's mine. I told him he needed to learn to cope with her being here. I would handle the training and he wouldn't have to deal with her often. To this day, he still doesn't handle her well and when he does, he's annoyed at every little thing. This was just another sign to me that he could never handle a child. During this time a divorce was discussed for the first time and he convinced me again, he'd try harder and change.\n\n2024: In January of this year, he quit his job. He claimed the workplace was unsafe and the staff was rude and threatening. It was a grocery store... My birthday again was a week or so after his unemployment. He told me he was going to call in a reservation for dinner, but forgot and would make it up to me. That never happened. The reason I mentioned birthdays is because it's the easiest way to show you all the little things about me that he couldn't remember. Every year for his birthday, I would take him out to his favourite restaurant, buy him $300-$600 worth of gifts, make him a cake at home, and plan some other fun activity. I simply just wanted a \"Happy birthday!\" without needing to remind him... From now to then our marriage has been filled with endless fights, things said by both of us that can never be taken back, resentment that has reached a boiling point, and one party (myself) wanting to leave and file for divorce, while the other is in denial. I have made it extremely clear that if his attitude toward me didn't change and if he was still unemployed by the end of the year, I'd be moving out and filing for divorce. He has never taken this as more than a threat, but I've always been serious. We have not been sharing a bedroom for a year, we haven't kissed or held hands in almost a year, and the only time I'm told I'm important is after I say I'm leaving. I loved him deeply, I wanted him to be the father of my children, a little part of me still does. But how do I stay when I feel I've been used for a free ride while being belittled and under appreciated.\n\nI have plans to pack up my things, 3/4 of our pets, and leave for good. I will be filing for divorce and feel the need to cut most if not all ties or I will be tempted to come back. I've left out a lot of wedding drama details, and rude things said during fights to keep it a little more anonymous. I feel absolutely sick to my stomach thinking about leaving and I never wanted to have to leave this way or at all. But I feel as though I have no other option as I've asked him to move out and he refuses. I've asked him to try, to get a job, and show me he appreciates and loves me.. he doesn't. He will be left with the apartment paid off up until January 1st and all the bills will be paid by me as well before being transferred into his name. His pet will be left with lots of food and supplies by me to last until he can get a job. I feel like leaving is something I need to do to be happy, as I am currently miserable and burnt out, but I still feel horrible for leaving this way.\n\nSo, AITAH?",

      "selftext": "I (22F) don't have an amazing relationship with my family, but I don't feel comfortable cutting any more contact with them than I already have, just living almost two hours away from them and not really texting them more than necessary.\n\nBut that leads me to today, when I was at their house earlier to help babysit my brothers. The day went mostly okay, or as okay as twelve hours worth of breaking up fights between two rambunctious tween boys (10M and 13M) for no pay can be.\n\nWhen our parents finally got home, I stuck around for a couple hours more to just chat, and also to let my parents settle in a bit before I left.\n\nAnd chat I did, not just with my recently-returned parents, but with my brothers too. Which is where I made my mistake... So, it's a running joke in my family to call somebody (or just a body part of theirs, like their face) a random household object, such as a towel or a couch cushion. In the middle of one of those jokes, my (13M) brother asked my dad for some Ritz crackers, to which I cut in and said, \"you're a cracker,\" without really thinking due to how fatigued I was.\n\nFor those who aren't versed in the connotations of calling somebody a cracker: a cracker is a colloquial that originally referred to a whip-cracking slavemaster.\n\nMy parents proceeded to blow up the moment I had said that, meanwhile my (13M) brother awkwardly just grabbed the crackers and left the room. Well, I say \"my parents,\" but it was mostly my mom, who is white and also a firm believer in the concept of reverse-racism. My hispanic dad mostly kinda just jokingly went \"wooahhh\" before shit actually hit the fan, after which he silently just nodded his head to whatever my mom said.\n\nI didn't really say much as I was berated, besides replying to my mom's pointed question of \"Do you know what 'cracker' even means?\", but all I could think about was how my parents both feel no shame in saying the n-word (including the derivative that rhymes with what you would call a baby pig) in the comfort of their own home, and with the full knowledge of what they're saying, at that.\n\nI know two wrongs absolutely don't make a right, but was I truly an asshole for what I did? I've been thinking about that ever since I left.\n\n**tldr: In a family of non-black people who feel no shame in using the n-word, I jokingly called my 13-year old brother a slang term denoting a slavemaster on accident, and I was met with backlash.**",

      "selftext": "I (34m) saw my mom earlier today, and she told me she was hosting Thanksgiving dinner next week. She asked me to go, and I asked, who is going to be there? She gave me a look, a look that clearly said \"You know who will be there.\" So I just said no, I won't be going.\n\nI knew she was referring to either my dad or my brother, both of whom I am not in contact with. Very long story short, my dad has been verbally abusive for years, and emotionally manipulative. We had a very bad relationship for awhile, and about 2 years ago I finally pulled the trigger on going full no-contact. Very shortly after that, my brother, whom I was pretty close to, told me he didn't believe me about our dad and believed I was the primary problem, and if I just stopped being petty or whatever, it would be fine. This was very shocking, I knew he and my sister both have a good relationship with our dad but I didn't think he would just throw me under the bus.\n\nDespite being divorced, my mom and dad have a very civil relationship and often see each other for things like holiday dinners (he isn't out but we suspect my dad is actually gay). My mom is heartbroken that I don't communicate or see them, but I explained to her why I don't and likely never will again. She wants us to be able to make amends. I regularly skip Christmas gatherings, my nephew's birthdays, any other family gatherings, because I know they'll be there. For many reasons, I just can't see them. It isn't good for my mental health, I have absolutely no intention of ever trying to reconnect with them, if anything made me upset I would default to snide remarks that would just make everything uncomfortable for everyone and not at all help the situation. There's no point be around them.\n\nThe first Easter after I stopped talking to my dad, my mom invited me over for an Easter dinner. This wasn't even two months after the NC. I showed up, and my mom looked nervous and apologetic, and admitted she \"forgot\" and invited my dad to the dinner. She tried to pull the \"I mean since you're already here!\" card, but I just left. Now she knows not to try to Parent-Trap me into reconnecting, but she still clearly wants us to repair our relationship. It's just not something I'm capable of or interested in. I hate missing so many family gatherings, because I still love my mom, sister, and nephews, but as long as my dad and brother are regulars at the events, I can't be. I know how they are, I know how I am, and it's a bad mix that won't produce a positive outcome. It's gotten to the point they literally just don't invite me because they know I'll say no. Which is understandable because they're totally right. But my mom decided to invite me to Thanksgiving anyway, and I could tell saying no hurt her. She didn't say anything but it was written in her facial expression.\n\nIt breaks my heart too but I have very firm boundaries on this for a reason. I just hate that those boundaries cause negativity for the family I still care about. AITA for turning down my mom's invitation to Thanksgiving dinner?",

      "selftext": "[My previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1f7qwy7/update_3_aita_for_calling_my_fathers_wife_a_creep/)\n\nI'm happy to announce my daughter was born two weeks ago. She arrived a little earlier than expected, but she's perfect. My older kids are in love with their baby sister. And as much as I didn't plan to have a third child, I am truly glad I did.\n\nAs I mentioned last time I posted, my husband and I didn't announce the sex in advance when our first two kids were born. This time, I decided to give my father a heads up. After I found out about the whole \"girl mom\" thing, I became worried about how Sasha would react to the news I was having another daughter. Telling my father ahead of her birth would give him more time to prepare.\n\nSo about a month ago, my father told Sasha I was having another girl. As expected, she didn\u2019t take it well.\n\nA few days after I gave birth, my father told me that he and Sasha were separating. They\u2019re not sure about divorce, but he thinks that\u2019s where they\u2019re headed.\n\nSasha started talking to my father about having children around the time I made my last post. According to him, they started fighting about it when she tried to convince him to get his vasectomy reversed (I didn\u2019t know he had one).\n\nMy father said Sasha cried when he told her I\u2019d have another daughter, and they decided to separate a few days later. I\u2019m not very informed about the situation, but my father did state that the decision was mutual.\n\nAbout a week ago, Sasha texted me. It started with her congratulating me for my daughter\u2019s birth, then evolved into what seemed like a farewell letter to my children.\n\nNot much about them stood out to me (though \u201cyou\u2019ll never understand the love I feel for your children\u201d was an interesting statement). She talked about how much it hurt to know she\u2019d never meet my baby, or watch my daughter become a big sister. Sasha told me I had \u201ctortured\u201d her by keeping my kids away, and it was that distance that made her accept she \u201cneeded\u201d to be a mother.\n\nShe deleted the text a few minutes after I finished reading it. I decided not to reply.\n\nI haven\u2019t been thinking much about the situation lately, but the more I do, the dumber I feel for not realizing Sasha wanted kids sooner. I remember she started talking about my father\u2019s future grandchildren long before I got pregnant with my son. Her behavior around my daughter (at least before the Disney trip) always felt weird to me, but I still never made the connection.\n\nI still don\u2019t dislike Sasha, but I think she brought this situation upon herself. As much as I recognize my father is far from innocent, he\u2019s always been very clear about not wanting more children. Sasha is 47 years old, and while I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to have kids at that age, I know people who have. If that\u2019s what she wants, then I wish her luck.\n\nWe're also officially moving to Europe in 2025 (the work-related news I mentioned in my previous update were really, *really* great). My husband and I had been hoping for an opportunity like this for a while. We're helping the kids make arrangements to maintain contact with their friends (luckily, my daughter\u2019s best friend is my goddaughter).\n\nThis will be my last update. I\u2019m busy with my baby, and I\u2019ll definitely have a busy 2025 as well, so I don\u2019t intend to write about this anymore.\n\nI want to thank you all for the advice, reassurance and kindness you have shown me. Happy holidays!",

She's an attractive young woman with a small, but decent social media presence, and lives a lot of her life digitally (shit, more so than me, and I've been on the internet since 1997). She's been living with us for the past year, after she had a bad break up, tried to commit suicide, y'all know the deal. In that time (13 months) she has had six... acquantences, I guess? They aren't her BF cause apparently zoomers are too chickenshit to just be like \"I really like you, we should be a thing\" and they pussy-foot around commitment, but that's neither here nor there. In 13 months, she has helped financially the last four, with $200 on a $1600 rent. My wife feels bad about asking her to help with utilities and shit, and white that shit kinda irks me, the thing that really bugs me, is that she always brings  by her \"exclusive\" of the week and has them over.  \nLook, I'm in my mid 30's, I live in fuckin' boonies. I live a calm, quiet life with my wife and son and pets. I like smoking my weed.\n\nI don't like random dudes from the city in rotation in my fuckin house every three to six weeks spending the night, with my pregnant wife and my toddler in the next room over, and my belongings. She meets these dudes on Tinder and shit and idk, I feel like she pays $200 so she should get some say, but at the same time, fuck outta here with $200 if that's reason enough to bring randos to spend the night.\n\nWho the fuck are these guys? I don't know shit about them, and people in America are fucking looney bins, I'm not fuckin around to find out.\n\nSo, AITAH for wanting to tell her: \"hey, stop bringing in your fucking bi-monthly boyfriends into the house were your pregnant sister and toddler nephew live and sleep?\" or am I just a boomer lol :(\n\nEvery celebration or family get-together we have, there's always a new douchebag in the photos and I'm not feelin that, feels hella intrusive\n\nedit: I just want to make it clear, that I don't mind her bringing people over for cookouts or having a social life, or trying to find a partner or even getting laid or anything like that.\n\nI just don't want people that I don't know (particularly men that I don't know) sleeping over at my house, when I have a pregnant wife and a toddler.",

Before my mother passed, our childhood was tumultuous. Father was/is an alcoholic, and my mother was dying of cancer for 5 years and was trapped with him. My mother was an amazing person and we never knew she was suffering until they very end.  I never felt \"at home\" after my mother passed. He tried forcing his new wife on us, and we didnt care for it. Not because we were evil, but we were teenagers still string to process her leaving. \n\nBut I only felt \"at home\" when I built my own. Life and family that I'm proud of. My sisters have bother done the same. We're close because I think our mother passing forced us to look out for one and other. \n\nMy father's new wife has issues and her son has been served time in jail for drug and violent offences. I told my dad after my children were born that I have no interest in having a relationship with my step brother, and my children will never be around him. It's nothing personal, I don't want my kids near someone like that. I've let him in my life probably ten times. I tried helping him multiple times when he was down on his luck. He stole from me, and took advantage of my kindness. Once I had a kid, I was done with him. Period. \n\nThis is where I'm wondering if IATA. He's on parole now and my dad wants him invited to Christmas dinner that I'm hosting this year. I said no. He got mad at me and said well his mother is refusing to come because my sisters and I need to learn empathy. I mentioned previously.. my sisters have also built good lives for themselves and are in healthy marriages. They're all coming home and feel the same, as they have young families. \n\nI am hosting and work a stressful job that I enjoy and work hard at. But I also enjoy booking time off and enjoying that. I love hosting my family, but if he's there I will be stressed out that he's there the whole time. As will my sisters. My dad told me his wife won't come if her son can't.

      "selftext": "My wife (33) and I (35)have been together for 5 years total. She\u2019s pregnant with her 3rd baby, my first. She has 2 kids from a previous relationship (same dad, her now deceased ex boyfriend). They\u2019re 8 & 9.\n\nShe was with her ex off & on for 10 years, since she they were in high school. The reason for the \u201coff\u201d periods was because he was a drug addict. Thats what killed him. Died of a massive OD. She wasn\u2019t a drug user. She rarely even drinks alcohol. He wasn\u2019t a major drug user when they met and started dating either, but they\u2019d been dating for a few years by the time he started using harder drugs and she was already \u201cin love\u201d with him by then & basically destroyed herself trying to get him to get clean.\n\nSo they had 2 kids together but he was never really an active parent. He went through periods where he\u2019d get clean for a while and was able to be more involved, but never stayed that way. He always maintained contact with them, but it\u2019s not like he had custody of them. I\u2019ve been the stable father figure in their lives and I did my best to respect that he was their dad and they loved him, did what I had to do to help facilitate the relationship while also keeping the kids safe.\n\nHe died and she was really devastated. She told me she\u2019d never get over him and that he was the real love of her life. Things got worse after that for a while but eventually she went to therapy to deal with years of everything he\u2019d put her through and things were really going well. \n\nThis baby was intentional and our whole family is excited about it. She\u2019s not quite 22 weeks now. We just found out it was a boy at the 20 week ultrasound. About a week after that is when she told me she wanted to name the baby after her ex. I told her hell no, sorry. We already had a few boys names we\u2019d talked about and both liked. We also previously agreed that to keep things fair we wouldn\u2019t use a namesake name from either side. I have important people I\u2019d like to name my son after too, but we agreed no namesake names. \n\nShe said it\u2019s just really been in her heart to do this and she knew I\u2019d be upset, but I should know how much he means to her. She\u2019s also trying to use the excuse that it\u2019d be something nice to do for her kids and it\u2019d mean a lot to them. They\u2019ve both suggested names, but none of those names have anything to do with their dad\u2019s name. \n\nWhy would I ever want to name my kid after a junkie who couldn\u2019t take care of his own kids? Who my wife says she\u2019ll always love?\n\nSo she asked if she could just use the same initials as her ex. No! I\u2019ll always know that my kid\u2019s initials are a tribute to this guy. She says I\u2019m being petty and jealous. Maybe I am but I stand by my petty jealousy!\n\nSo, do you agree with her that I\u2019m being petty? AITA for refusing to allow any part of my kid\u2019s name be in any way a tribute or reference to this guy or am I picking the wrong hill to die on? Would any anger I feel about it be less than whatever happiness she and her kids would feel about it, meaning I should just do this for their sake and I\u2019m an asshole if I don\u2019t? \n",

From since I was little, my parents made it known they would not financially support me in any way, no college or anything. They ended up getting divorced when I was 13 and Ive lived with my mom till I left last summer. I didn\u2019t ask for much, whatever I wanted I worked for by getting a job after sophomore year. I don\u2019t even have a driver\u2019s license because my mom didn\u2019t want to help. Some point after I got a job, I started paying my mom roughly $100 per month. I didn\u2019t mind, I wasn\u2019t saving up for anything major. I don\u2019t have a car, i\u2019m not married, and i\u2019m going to a different country for my duty station in January. \nWhen I was going through boot camp, my mom and her boyfriend started developing problems so by November, way after I graduated boot camp, they ended up breaking up. They didn\u2019t have the best relationship, that I knew before I left but it wasn\u2019t my business. Now she\u2019s trying to move out 3 hours away from where she lived and she\u2019s asking for money. First she asked for me to request a 4 year loan and I left it at that. It just doesn\u2019t benefit me in any way. Then she asked if could simply just borrow 4k then pay it back over time. It just irks me to why she can\u2019t get a loan like that in her own name or she doesn\u2019t have anything saved up.\nIt gets complicated because the reason she is asking for money is she was on paid leave for 2 months due to medical issues and now left her job and is trying to get one 3 hours away. So she has already asking for a few hundred every once in a while, she has paid me in the past except recently because of this issue. She\u2019s been doing a lot of things recently in spur of the moment. My little brother lives with her so he\u2019s stuck with whatever is happening at home or whatever she is doing. She\u2019s even made him ask me for money. I know it\u2019s not my responsibility to take care of him just because I was smart with my money and wanted to save it. I know if I give her this money now, I\u2019ll probably not see it again and it\u2019s gonna help her habit of constantly coming to me for money. So my mom and I didn\u2019t have the best relationship. Many other people in my life expressed care or interest in how I\u2019m doing or what i\u2019m doing in my life 10x more regardless how long they\u2019ve known me despite her being there my whole life. I feel like she just sees me as an ATM at this point. ",

      "selftext": "Earlier today, there\u2019s a group chat with A, D and myself. It\u2019s about yugioh. A and I play and talk shit all the time, and today was no different. It\u2019s always about who is better. At one point, A said something like \u201cI\u2019ma fuck your mom\u201d or something, to which I was gonna say something, and he said \u201cat least I can get hard\u201d or something similar. This honestly hurt me a lot. I have been struggling with mental health and substance abuse for several years, and this is a new consequence of years of drinking plus strong medication. \nThis whole year I\u2019ve only hooked up a couple times, and I\u2019ve shared this with A. I told him it really is affecting my self steem and I can\u2019t blame anyone but myself for my problems but it sucks. It was like the cherry on top a couple weeks ago that I needed to pick up a beer and binge drink for a week to end up in detox for 8 more days which concluded with losing my job and leaving my sober living. \nI probably said this in front of D, about low libido, who is also in the chat. I\u2019m working on switching meds that don\u2019t mess with libido or lower dosage, one provider even suggested testosterone booster even though my Testosterone level is fine. \nSo A apologized but really feels like gaslighting me into making me look like I\u2019m \u201ctoo emotional,\u201d and that I\u2019m making too much of a big deal out of this. I think it\u2019s fucked up that someone who I felt I could be confident enough to tell something so personal, would turn around and use it against me in an argument like that, and in front of D (or same group chat).

      "selftext": "35F. My husband Nate (36M) and I have two baby girls together (6F and 4F).\n\nI met Nate in college and have been with him ever since I was twenty. My husband prides himself on being \u201cstrong\u201d and won\u2019t talk about his feelings unless I pry. He\u2019s very protective of me and our girls and likes to take care of us in whatever ways he can. \n\nWhen I was in middle school, I was molested by my dad\u2019s friend. I\u2019m not ashamed, but it\u2019s also something I\u2019ve only spoken about with a few close friends and my family. I opened up to Nate about what happened to me after we\u2019d been dating for around two years, and I remember he had a very strong emotional reaction to learning about my abuse. He got teary (it was the first time I\u2019d seen him cry) and told me he wanted to kill the guy. He also told me that he understood how hard that was for me and so he\u2019s determined to make sure nothing like that ever happens to me again. I asked what he meant, but he wouldn\u2019t elaborate any further. I always had this comment in the back of my mind, but I didn\u2019t want to push him into telling me about something he wasn\u2019t ready to talk about.\n\nThe year we got engaged, we spent Christmas with his family. My MIL and I both had way too much to drink and were sitting and talking in the living room. Out of the blue, my MIL asked me if Nate told me what happened to him when he was little. I said no, and she started crying and telling me that someone hurt him very badly and I needed to talk to him about it.\n\nNate was rightfully furious when he heard this. He said that he was over what happened and didn\u2019t want to worry me unnecessarily. I told him that he didn\u2019t need to share anything, but I\u2019d selfishly like to know what his mom was talking about so I could support him. He said he didn\u2019t need support, but told me that he was molested and raped when he was in second grade. I told him I was so sorry and that I was there if he ever wanted to talk to someone about it. Nate told me that he doesn\u2019t like to talk about what happened because it sounds worse than it was and that he doesn\u2019t like to upset people unnecessarily. We\u2019ve talked about what happened to him twice since, but he really is resistant to letting me support him or acknowledging that it hurt him in any way. He also always tells me that what happened to him wasn\u2019t as serious as what happened to me because it\u2019s different for guys, which I obviously don\u2019t agree with. \n\nMy MIL is an entirely different story. On several occasions (usually after drinking), she\u2019s raised the assault with me. She\u2019s shared a lot with me, including some of the more personal details about the abuse and the fact that he was withdrawn and had night terrors for years after it happened. She\u2019s asked me if the abuse still impacts him, specifically, if he has nightmares or has trouble enjoying sex. I was very uncomfortable with these questions, but always said I hadn\u2019t noticed anything. \n\nI admittedly let this gone for longer than I should have because I had conflicting feelings about what I should do in this situation. On one hand, I know this was difficult for my MIL, and I wanted to support her in whatever way I could. On the other, I felt strange about the fact that I knew more about the situation than my husband realized and felt that my MIL\u2019s sharing sessions were a major violation of his privacy. \n\nI finally worked up the courage to tell my MIL that I\u2019m glad she trusts me with this information, but I feel guilty hearing about the situation from anyone other than my husband. I explained that he\u2019s very private about it, and I feel like these conversations are an invasion of his privacy. My MIL got teary and said Nate\u2019s just ashamed and doesn\u2019t feel comfortable talking about it because he\u2019s a man and doesn\u2019t want to be perceived as weak, especially by me. I told her I don\u2019t necessarily disagree, but I want him to have control over the situation and what he shares with me. My MIL, to her credit, seemed to understand and stopped talking about the abuse with me.\n\nLast weekend, my oldest daughter had a sleepover with her grandparents. The night we picked her up, she started crying when I was getting her ready for bed. She told me that her grandmother told her that someone hurt her daddy when he was little and that it made him very sad. My MIL told her that the person touched his private parts and said that some adults who seem nice are bad and want to hurt kids. My daughter expressed fear that someone may hurt her, and is even more upset about the fact that someone hurt her dad. I told my daughter that her dad is safe and happy now, and that the things that happened in the past aren\u2019t for her to worry about. I calmed her down, but my daughter is still scared, sad, and confused about the situation.\n\nWhen I told my husband what happened, he was devastated. He told me that he doesn\u2019t want her to worry about him and that he wants to be \u201cstrong\u201d for our little girls. I told him that we all know he\u2019s strong and he has nothing to be embarrassed about, but my husband kept saying that his mom humiliated him by sharing this with me and our child. I asked how he wanted to handle his mother, and he he was too overwhelmed to even think about it.\n\nYesterday, my MIL called about getting together with the kids again soon. I immediately asked why she thought it was appropriate to share deeply personal information about Nate with my six year old. My MIL said that my daughter needs to know that bad things can happen to kids and how to keep herself safe. I said that not only is it my job to teach her those things, but also, I can teach her to set boundaries and communicate with me without sharing her dad\u2019s trauma. I said that not only is my child afraid and sad, but my husband is embarrassed that his daughter knows about his assault. \n\nMy MIL then said I was feeding into his embarrassment by repeatedly suggesting it\u2019s something that shouldn\u2019t be shared with me or my daughters. She said that I\u2019m validating his fears that he has something to be ashamed of and that he\u2019s less of a man by encouraging the secrecy. I told her that I\u2019m not doing anything aside from letting him take the lead on what he wants to share and not taking to others about his trauma. She started crying and said I was failing as a wife by not encouraging him to talk about the abuse and insisting he go to therapy. She also said I\u2019m failing as a mother by not educating my daughter and leaving her vulnerable to predators.\n\nI\u2019m not proud of this, but I completely snapped. I told my MIL that maybe the reason he doesn\u2019t talk about the abuse is because she falls apart anytime the subject comes up. I said that the few times he\u2019s opened up about the abuse, he\u2019s too busy convincing me he\u2019s fine to let me comfort him or let himself process his feelings. I said I blame her for this impulse since he\u2019s had to be \u201cstrong\u201d for her so she doesn\u2019t lose it for his entire life. I also told her that she\u2019s failing as a grandmother by repeatedly violating her son and daughter-in-law\u2019s boundaries and teaching her grandkids that\u2019s okay.\n\nMy MIL said I have no idea what it\u2019s like when your child is hurt in the worst way possible and says she sincerely hopes I never have to experience that. She then said it\u2019s even worse to be the mother than a victim and that I have zero empathy for her. I said she was making it difficult to sympathize with her and hung up the phone.\n\nI do feel badly that I said she failed as a mom and a grandma even though she started it. I know it\u2019s a sensitive topic and I could have handled it better, but also, I was so angry. I told my husband what happened, but he\u2019s reached his emotional capacity at this point. I told him I\u2019d fix it and am considering apologizing to my MIL just to take the stress off of him. Aitah for how I handled the situation? I\u2019d appreciate any advice.",

      "selftext": "Ok so recently a tiny little kitten came out from under my van and ran up to me and my family. He was like maybe 5 weeks old and weighed 3 lbs on the dot. I took him to a vet and found out he was riddled in fleas and ear mites and malnourished. I have since decided to keep him and nourish him back to health. Now here is my dilemma. My neighbors left town for the last 4 days straight(weather has gotten cold af) and now that they are back they've been going around looking for a lost kitten(described very similar to the guy I found). I'm not torn on giving the cat to them. That won't happen as they obviously were not taking care of it, but their special needs grandson is who the cat was for and I feel terrible knowing that he won't get his kitten because they don't know how to take care of animals. It's worth mentioning their house is full of strays in their yard, which looks like a junk yard. They also have at least 3 dogs all of which don't look healthy and let themselves in and out of the house and all of the neighbors trash. AITAH for keeping the cat even after finding out who it was intended for? Or am I in the right for keeping the cat where it will be happy and healthy? ",

      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I need some outside perspective on this situation with my mom.\n\nFor context, my mom and I have a complicated relationship. We were estranged for several years when I was a teenager because of her struggles with addiction. We\u2019ve since reconnected, but things are still rocky. She\u2019s often dealing with health issues and family drama, and I\u2019ve tried to support her, but honestly, it\u2019s emotionally exhausting.\n\nRecently, when it became clear who the winner of the 2024 election would be, we had a heated conversation about Trump winning. I shared how devastated I felt because of how it impacts me personally (I\u2019m in a same-sex marriage, and I\u2019m deeply concerned about LGBTQ+ rights and abortion access). My mom felt I was being unfair in how I expressed my fears, and the conversation left us both hurt. Since then, things have been tense, and we haven\u2019t talked much.\n\nEarlier today, we had a phone conversation where she told me about a painful medical issue she\u2019s dealing with. I expressed sympathy and tried to be supportive, but the conversation took a turn. She said I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to struggle financially or live in pain. That upset me because, during the years we were estranged, I went through my own struggles that she wasn\u2019t there to witness. I pointed this out\u2014not to attack her, but to correct what felt like an unfair statement.\n\nShe took this as me throwing her mistakes in her face and got really defensive. Then she made a jab about how I should \u201cgo argue with my husband\u201d (who I don\u2019t even argue with much, so this felt unnecessary). The conversation ended with her saying she didn\u2019t want to argue and hanging up.\n\nShe called back a few minutes later, but I didn\u2019t pick up because I felt too upset and didn\u2019t think I deserved to be treated that way. I sent her a text afterward saying I didn\u2019t want to talk at the moment and hoped she felt better soon.\n\nSince then, I\u2019ve been reflecting on our relationship. I feel like every conversation eventually leads to tension or drama, and honestly, I\u2019m just tired of it. I have a lot of good things happening in my life right now (a new job, a raise, plans to move out of the area), and I want to focus on those positives without being constantly drained by this dysfunction.\n\nThanksgiving is coming up, and I\u2019ve decided to skip it this year to give myself space. I plan to send her a message explaining my decision while setting some boundaries, but I feel guilty because she\u2019s dealing with real medical issues, and I know her life has been hard. At the same time, I can\u2019t keep putting myself in these emotionally draining situations.\n\nSo, AITA for stepping back and skipping Thanksgiving with my mom?",

      "selftext": "So, this is all embarrassingly about a post in a crafting Facebook group. \n\nI\u2019m a middle school teacher, and I\u2019ve spent the last few days scouring the internet - Pinterest, Google, TPT, YouTube - for a lesson plan or instructions on how to recreate a Pioneer Day project I did as a kid in the 90s. Basically, every quarter my students get to earn a party where we do some kind of craft/fun activity. I thought it would be super fun to make tapered candles the way I did as a kid on Pioneer Day by dipping a wick into a crock pot or something similar. I remember having a really good time and my students really like crafts, plus I thought they may not have participated in anything like this before. After only finding small batch recipes that require pretty expensive, fancy ingredients, I turned to a Facebook group specifically for inexpensive Christmas crafting ideas. I posted my dilemma:\n\n- I have 120+ students\n- I would need to have them complete this in a classroom environment\n- The dipping would have to be done in less than 45 minutes, drying could take longer because we\u2019re doing this 3 days before break\n- the ingredients needed to be fairly cheap or else the school won\u2019t pay for them, and I don\u2019t make enough money to buy them myself. \n\nI mentioned that I have had no luck finding a lesson plan or information that fits the bill, hence why I was reaching out to the group. \n\nAlmost immediately after posting, and an older woman commented \u201cCan you Google it?\u201d \nAnd I, possibly too snarkily, said \u201cthis is such an odd question. Do you really think I didn\u2019t try that first?\u201d Because, again, I mentioned in my OP that I was having trouble finding info. I felt like I included lots of details that made it clear I had, in fact, googled it quite extensively and was having no luck meeting the requirements I had laid out. Then the replies started. Several other women commented: \n\n\u2022 \u201cyou could have been more nice about it \ud83e\udd26\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\u201d \n\n\u2022 \u201c\ud83d\ude21\ud83e\udd74People are trying to help\u2026Be nicer.\u201d \n\n\u2022 \u201csorry, but your response is very rude. A simple yes I checked Google would have been sufficient.\u201d \n\n\u2022 \u201cchill. You'd be surprised at how many times I've mentioned Google and people hadn't even thought of it.\u201d\n\nI replied twice to the replies and the gist was, \u201cit appears the commenter didn\u2019t read my post or ignored the requirements I needed. They weren\u2019t as helpful as they think they were.\u201d And \u201cI don\u2019t owe anyone niceness\u201d (which I can admit in hindsight isn\u2019t very *nice* either, but I genuinely felt like the original comment was dismissive and rude so I matched energy. As a woman, being told I\u2019m not nice enough is always a little annoying, so I realize this is potentially an issue I had a knee-jerk emotional reaction to.) \n\nI\u2019m sitting on my couch now, having turned off the comments of my OP because I\u2019m also pregnant and it was stressing me out to have a bunch of people call me rude over a reply on a crafting group, but now I\u2019m wondering if I should\u2019ve just left it alone. I felt at the time of my reply like it was actually the other commenter who was initially rude because, imo, \u201cGoogle it\u201d is basically internet speak for \u201cfigure it out yourself\u201d and I was reaching out to this group *because* I was having trouble. Now I\u2019m not sure and considering just talking my L, deleting the OP, and leaving the group.\n\nWhile I realize this is all a bit ridiculous to be writing and posting about, it\u2019s bugging me.

She also takes care of my niece (4yrs) and nephew (10 months). My sister (34 yrs) drops them off about 3 times a week. She then says she\u2019ll be back in 30 min - 1 hour and leaves. But she takes four hours instead. My niece is poorly behaved. She is constantly screaming, demanding things, throwing things, and refusing to listen. Just being plain disrespectful. My mom loses her patience and gets overwhelmed with her. Especially when she has to watch both kids. When she has her hands full with them it\u2019s difficult for her to help me. So I try to be understanding and patient. My mom won\u2019t tell my sister not to bring the kids too often, or not to take so long when she leaves them here. Why? She\u2019s afraid to. My sister gets extremely defensive and cusses and yells at my parents if they complain.\n\nIt\u2019s very stressful because there\u2019s constant chaos in the house. It makes my symptoms worsen. But if I say something, nobody cares. Because of my nieces behavior, we avoid letting her stay the night. My mom let her stay last night. Today, around lunchtime, my mom couldn\u2019t get my niece to eat. My niece was complaining that she was thristy and was screaming at my mom to give her juice. She does this because she doesn\u2019t want to eat but wants to drink juice, soda, sugary drinks instead (not because she\u2019s actually thirsty). My mom told her she\u2019d give her a drink if she ate a few bites of her food. My niece refused screaming \u201cNo! My stomach hurts!\u201d (another thing she says to avoid eating). My mom opened the fridge to get something when my niece saw some whipped cream in there. Then she started screaming at my mom to give her whipped cream. My mom started yelling back at her to shut up. I got fed up so I went to the kitchen to talk to my niece. I explained to her why she couldn\u2019t have the whipped cream. I told her to eat her food and leave grandma alone. She tried to throw her spoon at me and broke down screaming and crying. My mom got angry at me for \u201cmaking her cry\u201d, she told me I shouldn\u2019t have said anything to her.\n\nMy niece was begging my mom and saying \u201cI want a hug!\u201d. I told my mom she shouldn\u2019t give her a hug because that\u2019s just saying her bad behavior is okay. But she gives her a hug anyway just to get her to be quiet. Then she proceeds to scold me for making things worse. I told my mom I was going to text my sister and ask her not to leave my niece overnight anymore. She got scared and said \u201cNo, no, no don\u2019t she\u2019ll get mad\u201d. But I texted her anyway and explained what happened. My sister responded with an attitude and insulted me. Honestly, I\u2019m not surprised because she does this anytime she gets even remotely criticized. She thinks she\u2019s being attacked. I'm just surprised she didn't cuss me out. I'll try to attach screenshots of the texts. I want to note that I find it interesting that she talks about \u201dhaving more patience\u201d and tells me to do \u201cresearch on how to deal with kids who have been through trauma\u201d. Because she is really one to talk. She cusses and yells at her daughter all the time and makes her cry.\n\nMy parents and I NEVER cuss at my niece or nephew. My sister and her boyfriend are the literal REASON for the kids' trauma! Their relationship was a nightmare, and it did a lot of harm to the kids. Now did I say that to her to be cruel and make her feel bad? No, because I won\u2019t stoop to that level. But she thinks it\u2019s perfectly fine to insult me about my disability? Then brushes it off and tells me to \u201crelax\u201d? It's such an immature and hurtful response. I just sobbed and screamed because my mom left with my niece to the store and I was finally home alone, I needed to release some frustration. I sent the whole text exchange to my dad and asked him to speak to my mom about it. His response? \u201cI guess it was inevitable\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s all part of a growing family\u201d. This is how it\u2019s always been, no repercussions for my sister. Just keep quiet and don\u2019t make her mad. If there was some way for me to move out and not have to depend on them anymore, I would do it in a heartbeat. If you were me, how would you feel? Is my reaction valid or AITAH?\n\nEdit: I couldn't upload screenshots of the text conversation because images aren't allowed. I I copied and pasted them below instead.\n\n  \nME - Please don\u2019t let (niece) stay here overnight. I don\u2019t know if mom tells you how she actually behaves when she\u2019s here or if she just glazes over it. But she doesn\u2019t listen at all and mom is always complaining about it. They\u2019re constantly yelling at each other. I tried to help by talking to (niece) when she was screaming about wanting to eat whipped cream instead of her food. But she started crying and screaming even worse and mom gets mad at ME for \u201cmaking her mad\u201d. She babys her. She was begging mom for a hug after she threw a tantrum. Mom just gives in and hugs her to make her be quiet. She\u2019s basically telling her that her bad behavior is okay. It\u2019s crazy because first mom\u2019s complaining and getting frustrated with her. Then she gets pissed at me for trying to help.\n\nSISTER - Yes she does the same here. I\u2019m getting help for her and help her for what she\u2019s seen. You are set up in your princess style bedroom waited on hand and foot. If you want to help anyone help your mother dearest and maybe help her with patients and speaking better to (niece) about what she wants done and why and if she doesn\u2019t listen she is in time out or there is a consequence\u2026 sorry she bothers you but now you know why I need the help. Please try to do research on how to deal with kids that have been through trauma. It sucks.\n\nME - \u201cWaited on hand and foot\u201d lol. I have a disability that drains me of energy. Try to function with a heart that\u2019s beating 100+ beats per minute every time you try to stand on your feet or move the slightest. So you constantly feel dizzy, out of breath, like you\u2019re gonna faint. Not only that, but multiple symptoms from other health conditions, too. And side effects from all the medication. Of course you would need help. Whenever I feel a bit better I try to do as much as I can on my own. But even so, mom is getting paid for helping me. \n\nSISTER - I know what you have I\u2019m just saying relax and kids are not easy. Thanks for letting me know. You don\u2019t have to defend yourself over something you know nothing about.\n\n\n\n",

      "selftext": "  \nFor context, The baby's 100th day is celebrated in my culture with a small party; essentially, family and friends gather between the 4th and 6th month of age. At this point, the infant takes her first mouthful of solid food and selects an item that is presumably meant to predict her future self. ( Its stupid but fun, eg, my daughter choose a pen, so we think she will be interested in studying.)  \nAdditionally everyone brings gifts for the baby, family usually gives gold, and friends give baby product.\n\n\n\nI've been with my husband for 6 years, and I can tell you that his family doesn't really like me. For the first four years of our relationship, I put a lot of effort into it, but once we were engaged and his family wasn't too enthusiastic, I gave up. Even though we still get together for celebrations, birthdays, and other events, I no longer make an effort to speak with them. (When we got engaged, my husband assured me that I didn't have to put in a lot of effort to win his family's approval, so I quit.)\n\n  \nMy in-laws haven't had a major part in our lives since we got married; we only see them 4 or 5 times a year. Since they haven't seen our baby yet, I invited them to this celebration. They were hesitant, attempting to argue that this isn't how we do things in our family and that we don't understand your foreign culture. I politely told them that it is their wish whether or not they want to see their grandchild, and I wouldn't force them to.  \n\n\nLast week, there were around 50 people to celebrate my beautiful child, the most of whom were from my side of the family. Everything was nice and pleasant, my MIL, FIL, and SIL arrived as well. After that, it was time for the presents. As previously said, every member of my family gave my child a gold earring, necklace, bracelet, or coin.  \n\n\nAt the party, my in-laws began to remark that it was a waste of money to give gold to a small child, but nobody listened. They then criticised me for not telling them that my family would spend so much money and accused me of making them look bad.\n\n  \nI apologised, explaining that it was simply part of our tradition and that I thought you wouldn't be interested because you had never been. They complained to my husband, he ignored them, but they still woudnt stop.  \n  \nit started of as me trying to make them look bad, to them now demanding i give them some of the gold as my daughter has no use for it and its meant to be shared with family.  \n  \n  \nWhen my husband and I stopped picking their calls, my SIL posted on instagram and facebook about child cruelty because our 6 month daughter has her ears pierced and wears small earrings. I get that its not common in the US hence why everyone now thinks i am torturing my baby. \n\n\n\nThe thing is I feel like i am not in the wrong, but when i read all the comments about me being a horrible parent and using my baby to make money it just feels bad. \n\ni am posting this to see if everyone thinks the same ig ?\n\n",

      "selftext": "I (16M) am in my junior year of high school and I plan to move to a different state for university immediately after I graduate. Almost two years ago, my family dog, Lucy, passed away from old age. We got her when I was around two years old and I honestly do not remember what my life was like before her. When she passed everyone in my family was devastated, but almost immediately my dad started talking about getting a new dog. I was surprised for two reasons:\n\n1. He barely paid any attention to Lucy when she was alive, and it was entirely our (me, my mom, and my siblings') job to feed, walk, and hang out with her.\n2. My mom had very clearly stated she did not want to get a dog for a while after Lucy's passing.\n\nI was obviously pretty upset that he was already talking about getting a new dog and confided in my mother that I was NOT ready for a new dog and was still actively mourning the loss of a dog I loved and lived with my entire life. My mom told me that we were not getting a new dog and I had no reason to worry, so I let it go.\n\nFast forward to a year ago, my dad continued his antics trying to get a dog even with my mother saying no. I don't feel safe telling my dad that I don't want a dog because I am not emotionally prepared and I asked my mom if they could wait until I graduate to get a dog. She once again reassured me that we were not getting a dog anytime soon, but this time it was harder to believe. It got worse when she said that we \"probably wouldn't even get a dog until spring at the earliest\" which made me doubtful because her opinions have changed a lot from a hard no to a maybe.\n\nLast night, my mother admitted that my dad found a dog breeder near us that would be a \"good match\" and I clearly expressed that I still wasn't ready. I told her that if they got a dog I wouldn't interact with it, take care of it, etc. I said that I would have no harmful intention or anger towards the dog at all, I just don't want anything to do with it. She said I was being childish and selfish and I should \"prioritize the needs of my family\". \n\nI wouldn't care if they got the dog after I moved out, I just asked if they could wait. I don't feel like this is an unreasonable request, but I wanted to make sure I'm not being biased. So, AITA?",

      "selftext": "I (23F) have a son who is 2 now back in July we sadly lost his father (21M) in a motorcycle accident and, I didn't take it well at all I just wanted to stay. Instead of saying home and laying in bed I worked hard to save up money to move away. I didn't plan on telling anyone I just missed my family at that point and needed them and, for the next 2 weeks it seems fine. We all went to his body before they animated him for the actual funeral, I was kinda help with his friends and invites. Then his family started taking Grace's (not real name) (19F) word over mine I knew him for 4years long. They just didn't seem to care about my word they kept taking her word over mine. Which made me feel uncomfortable welcome like they didn't llike me as much as they liked her. They didn't really get to know her tell about then and, she knew him for about 7-5months. So yes I was being a bit childish for that but, not as childish I was when I posted something. I'm not the best at cleaning and I will own up to that but, I can clean up well then I really get going. I'm saying this because this is the reason why we broke up in the first place. We did work at the place as well and some of his work friends new me pretty well so, I did make a few friends with his friends when I started working there after he moved out. We would also talk sometimes about our son and our pets that we had together still. When he passed away I took the 2 days off I was allowed for grievance then I came back everyone was very supportive. They allowed me to take a few minutes to myself if I needed it as well, and it wasn't easy working there after he was gone. I was sitting one day waiting on something when one of our mutual friends that I'd always see him talking to walked up to me and, she told me I feel like you need to know that you should that he always talked about you and no one else. He would always talk about and say my baby mom takes such good care of our kid and, said he still loved you very much he was always looking at you with love. That made me feel sentimental and very emotional so I posted something on of my social media accounts, just saying I wish I was a better gf to you and I'm sad but happy to hear you still loved me. After posting it I didn't think much about then not even 30 seconds later he's ex was blowing up my phone. Grace was saying he didn't love you anymore you need to get over him and move on he never talked about you, you need to take the post down. So I told her what he said to me very bluntly, I said he was planning on moving back and breaking up with you anyways. So we had a bit of a cat fight over texts until. I said well you won't have to worry about me and my son anymore anyways because we are moving to my home town. Grace instantly started to back track saying no you don't have to do that I don't mind you guys. So I told her what she wanted to hear. Posting about him here and there still not saying anything about moving. Then the funeral happen I was back to my nice self not being bitchy letting her think she was okay in my book. Then after the funeral and stuff I told Paul's family I don't want Grace around my son then, a few days later they said don't do this her she needs him so I told them what they wanted to hear. I still didn't tell them I was moving until the last day of work by that time it's been about 4 weeks I told them that night after I got off work. The very next morning Paul's brother was there trying to guilt trip me into keeping my son there while I move. I told them that is not happening they started doing it every single day and, I still didn't comply then they started being rude about my family. Just for some context my family is poor and can't afford long trips, so they didn't come to see my son when he was born. They just wanted me to leave him there they said he's the last thing of Paul we have completely forgetting about cleaning out my house of all of his thing. He used my house as a storage unit I didn't really mind it after he was still nice to me. They took pretty much everything but the things he left to me I hide all of that. Then when the day it came to move Paul's family looked all through our son's baby stuff and, asked me what all Paul had purchase for our son so I told them. Then the started taking toys that Paul purchased for our son saying you don't need them so I had to ask them not to take all of them because he still needs them to play with. They did help a bit with the moving process but only with the small stuff that was left that was Paul's. When my mom and brother came it we got most of it out and my mom cleaned up pretty well and my brother was a big help with moving things. It took us about 7hrs to get everything out or at least as much as we could before we had to leave it was 2am by the time we decided to leave. So when I went to go get my son it was not in the car because, Paul's family decided to lock there door so I had it knock/bang on there door for them to open it. So I could tell them hey we are leaving could I please have my son so about 15mins later the brought him down. Then another 15 minutes to say goodbye to him which was fine, when we finally left they it felt like a big weight lifted off my chest finally going home I felt happy. AITAH?",

She rejected me, but we mutually decided that we could remain friends.\n\nA few months ago, she was sad, and wanted me to call her to cheer her up. We started calling, and played counterstrike. I died early in a lot of rounds (she's a bit better at the game than me lol) and got bored while waiting for the rounds to end. Without even thinking about it, I started fidgeting with my private parts. I felt terrible about it, but after a while of this, I became aroused. I didn't want to leave the call for this, and I knew that I could quickly deal with the situation, so I finished in a round after I had died. She had no idea that I did this, and I didn't think that it would ever come out and be able to impact our relationship.\n\nLast night, we were playing never have I ever with a group of friends, and the question came up, \"Never have I ever masturbated while talking to someone.\" I put a finger down, and when my friends questioned me on it, I, stupidly, admitted that I had done that on call with her before. When she learned this, she was instantly disgusted with me, and gave me the cold shoulder for the rest of the night. When I got home, I saw that she had blocked me on discord. I've been friends with her for a long time, so this really hurt me, especially because my relationship with her meant a lot to me. I feel like I fucked up something important, and I hate myself for it. I messaged my other friends who were at the party about it, and they all say I'm in the wrong, but I feel like she's slightly overreacting by throwing our relationship away over something so small.

      "selftext": "Need advice from older adults \n\nforgive me for the long story \n\nI had a best friend of 8 years . We met in 2018 and have been doing so much shit together. Went to weddings , funerals and , graduated high school together and even worked together . He was jobless at the time and I helped him get into the company I was in . This happened atleast twice when the first job closed down. \n\nRecently a couple of months ago he got a good job , that pays quite well . When he got his job , I lost mine and I\u2019ve been unemployed until now. Ever since then , he became proud . Paying for shit for the both of us and always bringing it up during conversations .Ive never asked to be paid for but he always insisted . He even paid for our road trip twice now \n\nBut yesterday , we had a huge fallout . He borrowed something of mine 2 days ago and promised to return to me the next day because he was sending me for my interview anyway ( my car broke down ) . The day came and he never got back to me  , we were late because I was waiting for him and he never showed up , nor did he even bother to text me at all . I called him , within 3 seconds he declined my call and after a while , told me he just woke up . Which doesn\u2019t make sense because he declined my call within seconds. He has a history of doing this btw , especially during important events . Cold feet or bailing at the very last minute . \n\nI told him that he put me in a difficult spot and he still got my item to return . Then he got mad and told me I\u2019m being calculative . He told me how he spent so much on me and how I\u2019m counting small stuff like this . \n\nI told him it\u2019s not about my item not being returned , it\u2019s because he didn\u2019t honor his word and clearly didn\u2019t take me seriously. The dude then got defensive and told me that he doesn\u2019t understand how am I so stressed out when I\u2019m jobless , and useless . He said how I lied about being abused as a child because he saw me as a fatass and didn\u2019t believe me . Claiming I made shit up all this time . For 8 years I\u2019ve been telling him my story on abuse and he threw it all in my face in 1 day . \n\nHe then said some really hurtful stuff and when I said he doesn\u2019t actually mean that and he better think wisely before he speak, he threatened to bring buddies of his over to my place to **** me up . He then took my laptop , and my clothes that he borrowed for weeks now , wrapped them up , and threw them out his balcony into bushes nearby and told me to find it . It was raining heavily at the time . I was willing to overlook the stuffs that he said to me but by throwing my shit out and making me search for it in the night like a dog under the rain , that was a different kind of betrayal . Idk if it\u2019s forgivable , I mean who even does that ? \n\nI don\u2019t know what to feel tbh . I\u2019m more than heartbroken but at the same time relieved ? Because I felt like I\u2019m being held hostage by him throughout these couple of months because of how he pays for shit and then brings it up , making me feel that I owe him . \n\nIs the friendship recoverable ? I can\u2019t accept the fact that this is it . Even though he threatened me like I was nothing to him , he meant a lot to me . ",

My (26f) friend (26f) has been in a situationship for about 5 years now. It\u2019s been a situation where they have been on and off for a long time, but the guy has never committed long term. She\u2019s talked about him at length for years and he\u2019s lead her on, calling her and talking to her a lot. She\u2019s been saying she\u2019s gonna cut off the relationship for a while now, and she\u2019s just waiting for a certain point in time. We were talking on the phone and she asked me if I thought he loved her and I said I do, but not enough. I\u2019ve told her this before. I told her it has to do with him more than her. He just doesn\u2019t want to commit. And I guess the next thing I said may have made me be the asshole because I said if you\u2019re not in a relationship now then you probably never will be because it\u2019s been so long. And if he wanted to commit he would have. She got upset and basically said my words meant she\u2019s an idiot and that he never loved her. And I said I didn\u2019t say that and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I do think he has feelings for her but there\u2019s something with him that makes him not want to commit. anyway now she\u2019s upset and I don\u2019t know. Did I go to far?

We\u2019ve been together for multiple years and I\u2019m still having a hard time with some stuff that happened early on. We\u2019re happy right now but inside I think I have bottled stuff up to keep peace. \n\nWhen we first met, she informed she had a previous billionaire boyfriend that she had 3ways with and went on lavish international dates with. \n\nI\u2019m a kinky guy and have had my fair share of experiences, but nothing like she did with this one guy. Early in the relationship, pre making it official, she was offering similar kinky situations and suggested we have threesomes with her friends but it would always somehow not happen. \n\nAbout a year into our relationship I caught her messaging the guy, who lived out of state, but had no real evidence anything happened between them other than an exchange of texts. She deleted and blocked him in front of me. \n\nI had also caught her in some lies, including not telling me she was HSV1 positive. \n\nSince this time, and my confrontation, I\u2019ve had a great time with her and am otherwise happy. \n\nBut I\u2019ve wanted to explore more kinky stuff with her, including 3ways, but she said she\u2019s happy with our sex and that was just part of an experimental phase. Any hint of wanting to explore that with her is shut down. \n\nTo me, it feels like she was giving preferential treatment to her previous partner who was far wealthier than I am. She insists this is not the case, but I can\u2019t help but feel that way. I thought I was over it and have told her it\u2019s fine. \n\nWe are now discussing spending our lives together and while I\u2019m very happy with her I can\u2019t help but hear a voice in the back of my head still sifting through these topics. \n\nAm I the asshole for not letting it go or wanting to pursue those kinks?

      "selftext": "Every holiday is so stressful for me.  My (41F) anxiety is through the roof every time.  My mom and sister just make it absolutely miserable for me.  My sister shows up late with Starbucks coffee in hand and sits and texts with someone while she is \"helping\" me cook, so it appears like she would rather be other people. She usually starts a fight with someone so she can storm off and leave right after we eat dinner and she takes a bunch of leftovers with her.  My mom has a separate property that is about 30 minutes from her house and about 45 minutes from my house.  She has 2 horses and a bunch of farm cats that she feeds.  She never rushes to feed all of them on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter when I end up hosting Thanksgiving dinner.  My husband (43M) ends up watching the boys (well, sort of.  I end up having to yell for him to go look for them.) and I end up doing all the cooking by myself until my sister finally arrives.  I usually end up making a 30 lb turkey, 10 lbs of mashed potatoes from scratch, 5 boxes of stuffing (Stove Top now to save my sanity a little bit), croissants that roll up and bake yourself, and 2 pans of green bean casserole. Furthermore, my mom expects me to cook food for 40-50 people, so we have leftovers for days for us and her and my sister. There's usually less than 10 people that come.  My in laws come sometimes. My mom will pitch in on buying stuff but she won't pitch in to help on anything until the very end and then she acts like I'm a psychopath when she finally does show up hours later . She usually shows up about time for us to start serving lunch. My sister is the exact same way. She'll tell me she'll get there early and help me with the cooking but then she doesn't show up until 10:00 - 12:00pm.  We usually eat lunch at noon or so. The last few years I've been a witch and told them I'm not starting cooking anything until they get here. Then they get upset because they want to look at the Black Friday ads and go Black Friday shopping that night.  My mom has tons of stuff in her kitchen (think hoarder) so there would be no way to do it at her house.  Table is covered with crap and counters are covered too. There is literally no room to cook or to eat dinner. It is plenty big enough but she just has too much stuff everywhere.  My sister also lives with my mom so she can't host.  I end up beating myself up because I think to myself how many more holidays will I have left with my mom. She's 66 years old.  My sister is 33 years old.  I just hate the holidays.  I have a special needs child who is autistic and kinda verbal but still requires a lot of help. He is 9 years old and not potty trained.  We also have a 6 year old too.  My mom always insists upon having my husband go with her to the farm to help with the animals. She goes every other damn day by herself but on the holiday she expects someone to help her.  I don't let this happen. What would you do?  I would love some advice.  \n\nEDIT: This year, we had family that invited us over and my mom and sister are saying they aren't going because they live about an hour away.  My response to them, \"Oh boo fucking hoo\".  I'm going early to make mashed potatoes and green bean casserole and help the host cook since I know how overwhelming it can be.  Then my mom asked me to go help her at the farm before we drove out there and she wanted to ride with us rather than drive her own car.  Hell no.  Tired of this shit.  ",

      "selftext": "I (23F) have a close relationship with my sister (27F), but lately, I\u2019ve been feeling like I\u2019ve become her emotional dumping ground. My sister has had a lot of ups and downs in her relationships over the years, and she often turns to me to vent, seek advice, or just process her emotions. At first, I tried my best to support her\u2014analysing situations, offering suggestions, and just listening. But honestly, it\u2019s been exhausting.\n\nI\u2019ve never been in a serious relationship myself, so I already feel like I\u2019m out of my depth when it comes to giving advice. On top of that, she doesn\u2019t seem to follow my suggestions anyway, which I do respect because it's not like she needs to do what I tell her - but in her last relationship she kept turning back to her toxic ex who hurted her, and there was a cycle where they broke up and get together over more than four to five times (that's only what I could count, but probably more), which makes me wonder why I\u2019m even involved. \n\nRecently, when she called me again to talk about her relationship (she moved on and got a new partner), I finally told her that I don\u2019t want to get too involved in her relationship issues anymore because it\u2019s draining and stressful for me. \n\nI also mentioned that it feels like my time and boundaries aren\u2019t respected\u2014our calls about her relationships often drag on for hours, and if I try to wrap it up, she\u2019ll ask to keep talking \u201cjust give me 5 more minutes\u201d, which turned out to be another 20-30 minutes listening to her. It feels like everytime she calls me, she expects me to be available to listen to her, while I am busy and have my own life going. I know we are both busy, she is also busy, and sometimes when I had emotional breakdowns over work and studies, she was also there for me, but I never called her constantly to seek advice on my studies or work. The frequency and intensity that we called each other to ask another to listen is just inequivalent.\n\nAnother point of my frustration is that, when I talk to her, or when our family talks with her, it seems like she only talks about what she wants, and doesn't really listen what others got to say. In our family groupchat, whenever my mum, dad or me share something, she rarely reacts, or at most just presses an emoji, then she would be posting about herself, her life, things she found interesting without addressing any of other conversation topics that the family brought up. This conversation patterns continues, and even gets worse when she enters a relationship - all she talks about is her relationship.\n\nShe responded by saying that she just needs someone to listen to her, not necessarily to give advice, and that I shouldn\u2019t feel so pressured. But for me, listening to intense emotional conversations about her relationships is already a source of pressure, even if I\u2019m not giving advice. I also pointed out that I don\u2019t come to her with problems nearly as often\u2014on the rare occasions I\u2019ve asked her for help (e.g., with issues about work, study or interpersonal interaction), it was more about practical advice than emotional venting.\n\nThen she said she did care about me, and she accused me of I never actively reach out to her and ask her how she is going. However, this comment makes me feels even more pissed off because for the number of calls we had, she would call me, ask \"How are you doing\" for like 3-4 lines, and then proceeding with telling me about her relationship. It made me feel like all her \"care\" are only paving a way for her to vent about her relationship. Whereas when I call her, I spend like 60-70% of the time listening to her life, then I talk about my life. It feels entirely different, and at this moment, talking to her just feels really draining. \n\nShe feels hurt and says it\u2019s unfair that I\u2019ve leaned on her in the past but am now refusing to be there for her. She also says it feels like I\u2019m pushing her away, and I can understand why she feels that way. \n\nI was about to depart from the city I\u2019m currently in to her city in the next couple of weeks to stay with her since I have an internship there. She had proposed that I could stay with her (but at the same time, I wouldn\u2019t be staying there for free\u2014my mum suggested she could cover part of her rent if I chose to stay with her during my internship). However, now that she\u2019s entered a new relationship and considering the way our communication has been lately, I\u2019m rethinking whether I should stay with her.\n\nIf I choose to live by myself, it will definitely be more expensive, but I do have the financial capability to sustain myself. At the same time, I feel hurt that voicing my suppressed feelings about not wanting to listen to her venting anymore might cause a rift in our bond.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if this is partly due to our personalities. My sister is a mega extrovert\u2014she needs to get things off her chest by talking constantly, and sometimes she even talks to herself out loud. I, on the other hand, am more of an introvert, and I find it hard to handle her constant need to verbalise everything and vent frequently.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been clear about my emotional limits, but she doesn\u2019t seem to respect them.\n\nAITA for setting this boundary and telling my sister I don\u2019t want to listen to her relationship problems anymore? And what should I do about the living situation in the next few weeks?",

It\u2019s mostly for fitness, but I\u2019ve also sparred here and there with people around my level. Last week, during open sparring, this guy named Greg (58M) came up to me and asked if I wanted to spar.\n\nNow, Greg is in good shape for his age\u2014lean, quick on the bag, and clearly experienced. But he\u2019s still 58. I hesitated at first because it felt weird, but he insisted, saying he\u2019s been boxing for years and can \u201chandle himself.\u201d The coach overheard and said, \u201cIt\u2019s up to you.\u201d So I agreed, thinking we\u2019d keep it light.\n\nWell, the moment the bell rang, Greg came at me like I owed him money. He was throwing heavy punches, cutting off the ring, and taunting me. I held back at first because I didn\u2019t want to hurt him, but he was landing some solid shots, and I realized he wasn\u2019t holding back at all.\n\nSo, I stopped pulling my punches.

But I feel like Greg asked for this. If you step into the ring and don\u2019t say you want to keep it light, isn\u2019t it fair game?\n\nStill, I feel guilty. Did I take it too far? AITA?\n",
