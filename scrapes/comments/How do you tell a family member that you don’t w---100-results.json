She has ruined so many birthday parties and holiday gatherings by throwing adult tantrums and making everything about her. This year I have been hosting all gatherings secretly and the difference in the peace level is astounding. I have enjoyed the parties and felt really happy when it was over. \nI can\u2019t really host thanksgiving/ Christmas in secret the way I can other things\u2026\nHow can I tell her it\u2019s so much lighter and easier without her?",
