      "selftext": "I (23F) have a close relationship with my sister (27F), but lately, I\u2019ve been feeling like I\u2019ve become her emotional dumping ground. My sister has had a lot of ups and downs in her relationships over the years, and she often turns to me to vent, seek advice, or just process her emotions. At first, I tried my best to support her\u2014analysing situations, offering suggestions, and just listening. But honestly, it\u2019s been exhausting.\n\nI\u2019ve never been in a serious relationship myself, so I already feel like I\u2019m out of my depth when it comes to giving advice. On top of that, she doesn\u2019t seem to follow my suggestions anyway, which I do respect because it's not like she needs to do what I tell her - but in her last relationship she kept turning back to her toxic ex who hurted her, and there was a cycle where they broke up and get together over more than four to five times (that's only what I could count, but probably more), which makes me wonder why I\u2019m even involved. \n\nRecently, when she called me again to talk about her relationship (she moved on and got a new partner), I finally told her that I don\u2019t want to get too involved in her relationship issues anymore because it\u2019s draining and stressful for me. \n\nI also mentioned that it feels like my time and boundaries aren\u2019t respected\u2014our calls about her relationships often drag on for hours, and if I try to wrap it up, she\u2019ll ask to keep talking \u201cjust give me 5 more minutes\u201d, which turned out to be another 20-30 minutes listening to her. It feels like everytime she calls me, she expects me to be available to listen to her, while I am busy and have my own life going. I know we are both busy, she is also busy, and sometimes when I had emotional breakdowns over work and studies, she was also there for me, but I never called her constantly to seek advice on my studies or work. The frequency and intensity that we called each other to ask another to listen is just inequivalent.\n\nAnother point of my frustration is that, when I talk to her, or when our family talks with her, it seems like she only talks about what she wants, and doesn't really listen what others got to say. In our family groupchat, whenever my mum, dad or me share something, she rarely reacts, or at most just presses an emoji, then she would be posting about herself, her life, things she found interesting without addressing any of other conversation topics that the family brought up. This conversation patterns continues, and even gets worse when she enters a relationship - all she talks about is her relationship.\n\nShe responded by saying that she just needs someone to listen to her, not necessarily to give advice, and that I shouldn\u2019t feel so pressured. But for me, listening to intense emotional conversations about her relationships is already a source of pressure, even if I\u2019m not giving advice. I also pointed out that I don\u2019t come to her with problems nearly as often\u2014on the rare occasions I\u2019ve asked her for help (e.g., with issues about work, study or interpersonal interaction), it was more about practical advice than emotional venting.\n\nThen she said she did care about me, and she accused me of I never actively reach out to her and ask her how she is going. However, this comment makes me feels even more pissed off because for the number of calls we had, she would call me, ask \"How are you doing\" for like 3-4 lines, and then proceeding with telling me about her relationship. It made me feel like all her \"care\" are only paving a way for her to vent about her relationship. Whereas when I call her, I spend like 60-70% of the time listening to her life, then I talk about my life. It feels entirely different, and at this moment, talking to her just feels really draining. \n\nShe feels hurt and says it\u2019s unfair that I\u2019ve leaned on her in the past but am now refusing to be there for her. She also says it feels like I\u2019m pushing her away, and I can understand why she feels that way. \n\nI was about to depart from the city I\u2019m currently in to her city in the next couple of weeks to stay with her since I have an internship there. She had proposed that I could stay with her (but at the same time, I wouldn\u2019t be staying there for free\u2014my mum suggested she could cover part of her rent if I chose to stay with her during my internship). However, now that she\u2019s entered a new relationship and considering the way our communication has been lately, I\u2019m rethinking whether I should stay with her.\n\nIf I choose to live by myself, it will definitely be more expensive, but I do have the financial capability to sustain myself. At the same time, I feel hurt that voicing my suppressed feelings about not wanting to listen to her venting anymore might cause a rift in our bond.\n\nI\u2019m wondering if this is partly due to our personalities. My sister is a mega extrovert\u2014she needs to get things off her chest by talking constantly, and sometimes she even talks to herself out loud. I, on the other hand, am more of an introvert, and I find it hard to handle her constant need to verbalise everything and vent frequently.\n\nI feel like I\u2019ve been clear about my emotional limits, but she doesn\u2019t seem to respect them.\n\nAITA for setting this boundary and telling my sister I don\u2019t want to listen to her relationship problems anymore? And what should I do about the living situation in the next few weeks?",

If she likes venting about stuff and getting off her chest why don't you guys make a shared Google doc or shared notes app so she can put everything down and you can set a day to \"read\" (skim it incase she calls you out on not reading it) and that way she's getting her vent, your getting your break from the venting and you guys can go back to your normal chats?",
