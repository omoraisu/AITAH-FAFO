      "selftext": "My father was supposed to pick me up at the end of a 5 day hiking trip and take me back to my car at the starting point. This was planned weeks in advance and he offered to do this. It's not possible to estimate the exact time one will complete a long hiking trip (74 miles), but I gave him a range on the last day between noon and 4pm. I called him the night before he was supposed to pick me up and told him between 2 and 4 PM and he said he'd be there. I pushed much harder than I would have liked to for the entire trip in order to get to the end in time for him. I finish at 3pm, and he's not there. No cell service so I can't call. I wait until just before dark and hitchhike back to my car. When I get ahold of him he tells me I didn't give him an exact time so he went to a friend's in another state and can come pick me up in a couple days! Since then I've had no contact because I am soooo mad. Am I wrong here?",
