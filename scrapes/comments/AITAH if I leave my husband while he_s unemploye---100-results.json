      "selftext": "Fair warning; this is a long one, I apologize, but need some input. Summary of a 7 year relationship incoming.\n\nI (26/f) have been married to my husband (28/m) for 4 1/2 years, in a relationship for 7 years total. While the relationship started great (2017), that only lasted for about a year. We met on Tinder, talked for 2 months, met in person and immediately became exclusive. I was 19, in college, and had never had a serious boyfriend. He was 21, just left a 4 year relationship where he had been living with her, and was living with his parents when we met. At 8 months into the relationship we had to move in together due to my schooling causing financial stress and his living situation. We moved in with the agreement that we would both work and pay half of the bills. I thought this was a great idea as he had told me he was paying for an apartment alone with his ex. (this was a lie, that I discovered years later, they lived with her parents and he paid for food.) I was in school full time while working as many hours as I could to pay my half. He was working a fast food job part time and didn't look for other work (he was not in college and never attended).\n\n2018: After 3 months living together, we were thinking about getting engaged. I bought the ring, as he wasn't working as many hours and couldn't afford it. The ring wasn't outrageous in price, as I couldn't afford much either, it was under $1,000. He promised he would make up buying my own ring to me with the proposal. The ring sat in the apartment for weeks and I thought he was planning something special. When one night, he proposed in the living room of our apartment, no speech, could hardly remember my full name, and didn't get down on one knee. He just sat beside me, stumbled over my name, and asked me to marry him. I said yes. At the time I wasn't disappointed with the proposal, as I truly loved him and thought he was just too nervous to do it publicly.\n\n2019: A month after our engagement, he got fired. With the craziness of losing his job, he forgot my birthday and I thought it was an accident, but it was a red flag. For the remainder of my schooling, he told me he was applying to several jobs with no luck securing one... From Jan-Aug, I was in school, working two part time jobs, and paying all the bills alone, while he sat in the apartment and played video games. I was still the one to do most of the cooking and cleaning, unless I encouraged him to help me once I started. After I left college, we couldn't afford to stay in the city we were in with only my income. We had to move back in with my parents for about 3 months. During that time, I was still the only one working to secure income and looking for a new apartment.\n\nI managed to secure us an apartment in a shared home in my hometown and he was able to secure another fast food job. While I launched my own business and worked part time, he was also working and contributing to the household for the first time in almost a year. It was the first Christmas that we could both buy each other gifts and actually celebrate a holidays without financial stress. It was great and the first holiday that felt like we were a little family. At the time we had two cats and had just adopted a third as a Christmas gift to each other. We bought his wedding band and I purchased that one as well. It was more expensive than mine, and he lost it within a year of the wedding.\n\n2020: Shortly after Christmas, I got extremely sick with a mystery illness that was never diagnosed. (rapid weight loss, constant exhaustion, severe stomach and joint pains, and more that I won't go into.) I knew with his income alone we couldn't pay our bills. So I pushed through the pain and continued working. This was also the same month COVID hit. My work got reduced but with him being in fast food his shifts stayed the same. However, he started call in constantly and missing multiple shifts a week. On my birthday that year he was sick and I thought that was why he forgot to say happy birthday until I reminded him.\n\nBy February, he was unemployed again due to calling in. I was the only one working and we were a month away from our wedding. After he got fired, our wedding venue had to temporarily close due to COVID and we had a makeshift wedding outdoors in winter weather with 10 people in attendance. The wedding, mixed with COVID caused a lot of drama with his family and my own extended family and that caused even more tension in our marriage. We tried to replan at our venue in 2021 but after all the family drama, it just wasn't worth it. I never got a real engagement, a real wedding, or a honeymoon... Which I know isn't a massive deal and at the time I was more than okay with it all, because I had the love of my life by my side.. and we couldn't afford it.\n\nBy May of 2020 we were in the same financial position as our last apartment and again, resorted to moving in with my parents. During this time, I had a small business that was bringing in quite a bit of money and working a part time job. He was unemployed from about Feb-Jun and then got a position part time. I managed to save up enough money, and got us into another apartment in my hometown.\n\n2021: The apartment is huge, cost effective, and a decent landlord to deal with. When we moved into the new place (oct 2020), it felt like a fresh start. We were both employed, my business was taking off, we were talking about children and then, he started calling in again... Within a few months of being in the apartment, he lost another job. He promised me he would have a new job within a month. My birthday past again that year and he forgot and used his unemployment as the reason for not doing anything when I reminded him. He didn't get another job for a year. During all this time I was still incredibly sick, losing weight, and trying to keep motivated while being in and out of the hospital.\n\nWe started to incur debt and I wasn't able to afford the rent alone. I had to rely on my parents a lot to save my ass and I am forever grateful for them. I had to get credit cards which built more debt and in turn made the situation worse. While I cried and pleaded with him to apply for jobs anywhere to help us get out of the hole we were in, he was picky with applications and wouldn't take any minimum wage jobs. With how much I was working with how sick I was I couldn't keep up with the house chores. I asked him to at least keep the house clean while I worked to pay the bills and tried to recover. He would do the dishes once after a fight broke out, but eventually I didn't have the energy in me to fight and the apartment became a dump. It was impossible for me to keep up with. It eventually got so bad, I was embarrassed to ask my family members or friends for help and it added more stress to the marriage and made me feel secluded from any kind of community. I was feeling incredibly alone and neglected by him and made that clear. I asked for more help, more attention, more affection, someone to vent to. Every time I brought it up, I was told I was nagging him and he was trying.\n\nDuring this time, many fights broke out where I was told I was the reason he was unhappy and that if I would just cheer up maybe he'd be able to make be happy. This was the point where I couldn't take it anymore. I set very clear boundaries, told him I expected him to pull his weight, help clean, at least get a part time job, and treat me kindly or I would be leaving. This was the first of many times he cried, promised me he'd change, that I meant the world to him, and he loved me enough to try more. The trying would happen, I do have to give him some credit, but within a week, he would be back to playing video games all day, ignoring me when I spoke to him or giving me an annoyed 'what?'. A job was also not something he got until November of 2022.\n\nFrom 2022-2023 he held down a part time job making minimum wage. It was good, we were able to pay all our bills for a year, we weren't struggling to afford food, and our animals were spoiled. However, he and I were still having constant arguments about household chores, how he was treating me, and how often we were physically affectionate. In December of 2023, we got a marriage 'fix it' puppy (I was smart enough to not have a fix it baby...) At the time I thought it would prepare us for taking care of something with more needs, that requires patience and training. The week we got the pup, I had to travel for work for two nights. I called him to see the pup a few times and things seemed fine. When I got home, he was irritated and the first thing he said was 'I think we need to get rid of the dog, I can't handle her.' I was devastated. That pup is everything I ever wanted and more, she may be a handful, but she's mine. I told him he needed to learn to cope with her being here. I would handle the training and he wouldn't have to deal with her often. To this day, he still doesn't handle her well and when he does, he's annoyed at every little thing. This was just another sign to me that he could never handle a child. During this time a divorce was discussed for the first time and he convinced me again, he'd try harder and change.\n\n2024: In January of this year, he quit his job. He claimed the workplace was unsafe and the staff was rude and threatening. It was a grocery store... My birthday again was a week or so after his unemployment. He told me he was going to call in a reservation for dinner, but forgot and would make it up to me. That never happened. The reason I mentioned birthdays is because it's the easiest way to show you all the little things about me that he couldn't remember. Every year for his birthday, I would take him out to his favourite restaurant, buy him $300-$600 worth of gifts, make him a cake at home, and plan some other fun activity. I simply just wanted a \"Happy birthday!\" without needing to remind him... From now to then our marriage has been filled with endless fights, things said by both of us that can never be taken back, resentment that has reached a boiling point, and one party (myself) wanting to leave and file for divorce, while the other is in denial. I have made it extremely clear that if his attitude toward me didn't change and if he was still unemployed by the end of the year, I'd be moving out and filing for divorce. He has never taken this as more than a threat, but I've always been serious. We have not been sharing a bedroom for a year, we haven't kissed or held hands in almost a year, and the only time I'm told I'm important is after I say I'm leaving. I loved him deeply, I wanted him to be the father of my children, a little part of me still does. But how do I stay when I feel I've been used for a free ride while being belittled and under appreciated.\n\nI have plans to pack up my things, 3/4 of our pets, and leave for good. I will be filing for divorce and feel the need to cut most if not all ties or I will be tempted to come back. I've left out a lot of wedding drama details, and rude things said during fights to keep it a little more anonymous. I feel absolutely sick to my stomach thinking about leaving and I never wanted to have to leave this way or at all. But I feel as though I have no other option as I've asked him to move out and he refuses. I've asked him to try, to get a job, and show me he appreciates and loves me.. he doesn't. He will be left with the apartment paid off up until January 1st and all the bills will be paid by me as well before being transferred into his name. His pet will be left with lots of food and supplies by me to last until he can get a job. I feel like leaving is something I need to do to be happy, as I am currently miserable and burnt out, but I still feel horrible for leaving this way.\n\nSo, AITAH?",
