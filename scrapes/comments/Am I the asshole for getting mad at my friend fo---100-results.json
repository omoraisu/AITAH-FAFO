      "selftext": "I(19F) was hanging out with my friends and one of them joked that I was basically a pedophiles wet dream because I\u2019m 4\u201911 and 80lbs and in their words \u201clook prepubescent\u201d. Also because I wear braces. And it hurt my feelings that they\u2019d make fun of me for that because they know I\u2019m insecure about being flat and I couldn\u2019t get braces any earlier because I\u2019m from a poor family and we couldn\u2019t afford it. I feel like it was such an unnecessary comment to make. It ruined my whole mood and I left shortly after. I\u2019m being told I\u2019m overreacting because it\u2019s just a joke and not how they actually feel. Even then it\u2019s such distasteful joke \n\nLink to the update: https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/s/czqfwL2LKc",

Short pleasantries exchanged and my workmate asked him what he's done to his foot and he explains it's like this for the rest of his life. My workmate then called him a \"snipers nightmare\", everyone in the area laughs. They shake hands and everyone goes about their day. This is as tame as it gets, it was a workplace full of customers.\n\nWe say some horrendous things to each other with the goal of getting a laugh.

Maybe they were just downvoting all your comments on the thread. I don't think you're an evil person, and I actually do think it's valid to teach people to set boundaries instead of to be people pleasers.\n\nI just think there's a couple unfortunate situations that are necessary to acknowledge here. One is that therapy speak is commonly spread online by people who don't actually know the nuances of how to appropriately talk about the concepts in depth, so the words can be used too generally. The other is just the general experiences of women are very often not well understood by men. Yes, you can say the exact same thing in reverse to an extent, but it's just a fact that this was posted by a woman, so there is context that is important to consider as far as the kinds of experiences women often have. \n\nA boundary is not meant to control another person's behavior to force them to behave. A boundary should be about what you're willing to do if someone doesn't respect you when you tell them something bothers you, and she has made it clear that she wasn't a fan of this \"joke\". A boundary is what you are willing to tolerate from others, and she does not seem willing to tolerate this kind of thing. If she decides to \"set a boundary\", it very well could come off like an ultimatum, because if you have a boundary about what you will and will not tolerate in a friendship, it can only be enforced by being willing to leave the friendship if necessary. If she is already perceived by the \"joker\" as having overreacted, there's little point in saying, \"I'm not going to tolerate joking like this, and I will not be interacting with you if you continue to act this way towards me.\" She's already verbalized the issue, and the other person further disrespected her by invalidating her feelings about this. \n\nTo set a boundary here would just be an unnecessary step at this point, in my opinion. It would be like coming back and saying, \"Just so you know, I'm really serious about how much this bothered me!\" And it's just like... doesn't the reaction she had already prove that? To me, it's totally reasonable to just avoid this person at this point unless/until they send a sincere and reasonable apology because it sounds like she's already done her part in making her issue with the joke known. To say more on the matter without prompting would very likely get her more accusations of being \"dramatic\" because she's an \"emotional woman\". Because women are so often told that they are dramatic, a lot just end up being conditioned into swallowing their feelings and people pleasing to \"keep the peace\" because they are perceived as dramatic for having a reaction to gross things said to them... It is unfortunate but true that women have to hear very gross comments about their bodies throughout their lives, often starting at a very young age, mostly by men, but occasionally by other women too.\n\nAlso, me speaking about how common this is for women doesn't mean it never happens to men. This is a shared experience for most women though, and this is a post from a 19F OP, so the focus here IS the experience of women. I'm just adding that part for anyone in the comments who wants to make the assumption that I'm a bullshit feminazi, who only cares about women's issues because I didn't talk enough about a male perspective here when I'm a woman discussing something women often experience in a thread posted by a woman.",

Maybe they were just downvoting all your comments on the thread. I don&#39;t think you&#39;re an evil person, and I actually do think it&#39;s valid to teach people to set boundaries instead of to be people pleasers.</p>\n\n<p>I just think there&#39;s a couple unfortunate situations that are necessary to acknowledge here. One is that therapy speak is commonly spread online by people who don&#39;t actually know the nuances of how to appropriately talk about the concepts in depth, so the words can be used too generally. The other is just the general experiences of women are very often not well understood by men. Yes, you can say the exact same thing in reverse to an extent, but it&#39;s just a fact that this was posted by a woman, so there is context that is important to consider as far as the kinds of experiences women often have. </p>\n\n<p>A boundary is not meant to control another person&#39;s behavior to force them to behave. A boundary should be about what you&#39;re willing to do if someone doesn&#39;t respect you when you tell them something bothers you, and she has made it clear that she wasn&#39;t a fan of this &quot;joke&quot;. A boundary is what you are willing to tolerate from others, and she does not seem willing to tolerate this kind of thing. If she decides to &quot;set a boundary&quot;, it very well could come off like an ultimatum, because if you have a boundary about what you will and will not tolerate in a friendship, it can only be enforced by being willing to leave the friendship if necessary. If she is already perceived by the &quot;joker&quot; as having overreacted, there&#39;s little point in saying, &quot;I&#39;m not going to tolerate joking like this, and I will not be interacting with you if you continue to act this way towards me.&quot; She&#39;s already verbalized the issue, and the other person further disrespected her by invalidating her feelings about this. </p>\n\n<p>To set a boundary here would just be an unnecessary step at this point, in my opinion. It would be like coming back and saying, &quot;Just so you know, I&#39;m really serious about how much this bothered me!&quot; And it&#39;s just like... doesn&#39;t the reaction she had already prove that? To me, it&#39;s totally reasonable to just avoid this person at this point unless/until they send a sincere and reasonable apology because it sounds like she&#39;s already done her part in making her issue with the joke known. To say more on the matter without prompting would very likely get her more accusations of being &quot;dramatic&quot; because she&#39;s an &quot;emotional woman&quot;. Because women are so often told that they are dramatic, a lot just end up being conditioned into swallowing their feelings and people pleasing to &quot;keep the peace&quot; because they are perceived as dramatic for having a reaction to gross things said to them... It is unfortunate but true that women have to hear very gross comments about their bodies throughout their lives, often starting at a very young age, mostly by men, but occasionally by other women too.</p>\n\n<p>Also, me speaking about how common this is for women doesn&#39;t mean it never happens to men. This is a shared experience for most women though, and this is a post from a 19F OP, so the focus here IS the experience of women. I&#39;m just adding that part for anyone in the comments who wants to make the assumption that I&#39;m a bullshit feminazi, who only cares about women&#39;s issues because I didn&#39;t talk enough about a male perspective here when I&#39;m a woman discussing something women often experience in a thread posted by a woman.</p>\n</div>",
