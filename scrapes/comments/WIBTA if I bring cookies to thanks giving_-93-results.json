      "selftext": "I (19F) recently got into baking, maybe 6ish months ago so far I\u2019ve made basic deserts like cookies/cheesecake/muffins/biscuits/some pies. I don\u2019t know how to full bake well and the best thing I\u2019ve baked so far is the cookies since it\u2019s the desert I have baked the most. Anyways, my brother and my SIL is hosting thanksgiving this year and has tasked me to bring a dessert but they keep asking me things out of my skill range. I\u2019ve told them mostly my SIL that i can\u2019t bake well enough for the dessert they are asking me. I\u2019ve recommended different cookie flavors like pumpkin,cinnamon,chocolates chip,and sugar cookies. But I only got told \u201cEnough with the cookies they make to much of a mess.\u201d The thing is I\u2019m preparing it at my house and don\u2019t fully understand \u201cto much of a mess\u201d?? My mom is telling to just make the cookies but I don\u2019t want to disappoint my brother or SIL",

You are kind and generous enough to want to contribute cookies, as not only do you enjoy making them, but you found you are good at it.\n\n\nI have an awesome pumpkin oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe that is a massive hit with everyone. It's become a Thanksgiving tradition for my in-laws. One year I wasn't able to make them due to my work schedule....they went out and bought the ingredients and had great fun learning how to make them with me, lol!\n\n\nOne big secret professional bakers so to produce excellent cookies is to make the batter 24-36 hours in advance of baking them, storing the batter in the fridge. This gives all the ingredients a change to really meld together. Let the batter come to room temp, then bake them. Total game changer!",
