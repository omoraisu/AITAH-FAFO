And if he or I get tired before the other we go to our room and start our bed time routine. If the other is tired they come with, if not they stay in the living room and hang out.  If the one who went to bed first can&#39;t sleep then we&#39;ll read in bed or watch something to unwind until we fall asleep or the other comes to bed.<br/>\nAs far as the Friendsgiving thing that&#39;s embarrassing af.... why invite Friends over just to kick them out by 9pm cause she&#39;s tired. She&#39;s not freaking 5.... if she gets tired then she should have taken a nap before everyone came over. I would have understood like 1/2am.... but 9?  I&#39;d have been mortified</p>\n\n<p>And why tf does she think she can kick you out of your own fucking bed? You live together, I&#39;m guessing you pay bills just like she does that&#39;s your bed too! No matter how bad of a fight me and my SO have gotten in to neither of us has EVER even tried to kick the other out of OUR bed. It&#39;s not mine it&#39;s not his, it&#39;s OURS</p>\n</div>",
