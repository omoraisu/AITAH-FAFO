      "selftext": "\u00a0I (F 28 yrs) am disabled with severe anxiety and depression. I need help with daily living activities, my mom (64 yrs) is my in home caregiver. She gets paid for helping me. She also takes care of my niece (4yrs) and nephew (10 months). My sister (34 yrs) drops them off about 3 times a week. She then says she\u2019ll be back in 30 min - 1 hour and leaves. But she takes four hours instead. My niece is poorly behaved. She is constantly screaming, demanding things, throwing things, and refusing to listen. Just being plain disrespectful. My mom loses her patience and gets overwhelmed with her. Especially when she has to watch both kids. When she has her hands full with them it\u2019s difficult for her to help me. So I try to be understanding and patient. My mom won\u2019t tell my sister not to bring the kids too often, or not to take so long when she leaves them here. Why? She\u2019s afraid to. My sister gets extremely defensive and cusses and yells at my parents if they complain.\n\nIt\u2019s very stressful because there\u2019s constant chaos in the house. It makes my symptoms worsen. But if I say something, nobody cares. Because of my nieces behavior, we avoid letting her stay the night. My mom let her stay last night. Today, around lunchtime, my mom couldn\u2019t get my niece to eat. My niece was complaining that she was thristy and was screaming at my mom to give her juice. She does this because she doesn\u2019t want to eat but wants to drink juice, soda, sugary drinks instead (not because she\u2019s actually thirsty). My mom told her she\u2019d give her a drink if she ate a few bites of her food. My niece refused screaming \u201cNo! My stomach hurts!\u201d (another thing she says to avoid eating). My mom opened the fridge to get something when my niece saw some whipped cream in there. Then she started screaming at my mom to give her whipped cream. My mom started yelling back at her to shut up. I got fed up so I went to the kitchen to talk to my niece. I explained to her why she couldn\u2019t have the whipped cream. I told her to eat her food and leave grandma alone. She tried to throw her spoon at me and broke down screaming and crying. My mom got angry at me for \u201cmaking her cry\u201d, she told me I shouldn\u2019t have said anything to her.\n\nMy niece was begging my mom and saying \u201cI want a hug!\u201d. I told my mom she shouldn\u2019t give her a hug because that\u2019s just saying her bad behavior is okay. But she gives her a hug anyway just to get her to be quiet. Then she proceeds to scold me for making things worse. I told my mom I was going to text my sister and ask her not to leave my niece overnight anymore. She got scared and said \u201cNo, no, no don\u2019t she\u2019ll get mad\u201d. But I texted her anyway and explained what happened. My sister responded with an attitude and insulted me. Honestly, I\u2019m not surprised because she does this anytime she gets even remotely criticized. She thinks she\u2019s being attacked. I'm just surprised she didn't cuss me out. I'll try to attach screenshots of the texts. I want to note that I find it interesting that she talks about \u201dhaving more patience\u201d and tells me to do \u201cresearch on how to deal with kids who have been through trauma\u201d. Because she is really one to talk. She cusses and yells at her daughter all the time and makes her cry.\n\nMy parents and I NEVER cuss at my niece or nephew. My sister and her boyfriend are the literal REASON for the kids' trauma! Their relationship was a nightmare, and it did a lot of harm to the kids. Now did I say that to her to be cruel and make her feel bad? No, because I won\u2019t stoop to that level. But she thinks it\u2019s perfectly fine to insult me about my disability? Then brushes it off and tells me to \u201crelax\u201d? It's such an immature and hurtful response. I just sobbed and screamed because my mom left with my niece to the store and I was finally home alone, I needed to release some frustration. I sent the whole text exchange to my dad and asked him to speak to my mom about it. His response? \u201cI guess it was inevitable\u201d and \u201cit\u2019s all part of a growing family\u201d. This is how it\u2019s always been, no repercussions for my sister. Just keep quiet and don\u2019t make her mad. If there was some way for me to move out and not have to depend on them anymore, I would do it in a heartbeat. If you were me, how would you feel? Is my reaction valid or AITAH?\n\nEdit: I couldn't upload screenshots of the text conversation because images aren't allowed. I I copied and pasted them below instead.\n\n  \nME - Please don\u2019t let (niece) stay here overnight. I don\u2019t know if mom tells you how she actually behaves when she\u2019s here or if she just glazes over it. But she doesn\u2019t listen at all and mom is always complaining about it. They\u2019re constantly yelling at each other. I tried to help by talking to (niece) when she was screaming about wanting to eat whipped cream instead of her food. But she started crying and screaming even worse and mom gets mad at ME for \u201cmaking her mad\u201d. She babys her. She was begging mom for a hug after she threw a tantrum. Mom just gives in and hugs her to make her be quiet. She\u2019s basically telling her that her bad behavior is okay. It\u2019s crazy because first mom\u2019s complaining and getting frustrated with her. Then she gets pissed at me for trying to help.\n\nSISTER - Yes she does the same here. I\u2019m getting help for her and help her for what she\u2019s seen. You are set up in your princess style bedroom waited on hand and foot. If you want to help anyone help your mother dearest and maybe help her with patients and speaking better to (niece) about what she wants done and why and if she doesn\u2019t listen she is in time out or there is a consequence\u2026 sorry she bothers you but now you know why I need the help. Please try to do research on how to deal with kids that have been through trauma. It sucks.\n\nME - \u201cWaited on hand and foot\u201d lol. I have a disability that drains me of energy. Try to function with a heart that\u2019s beating 100+ beats per minute every time you try to stand on your feet or move the slightest. So you constantly feel dizzy, out of breath, like you\u2019re gonna faint. Not only that, but multiple symptoms from other health conditions, too. And side effects from all the medication. Of course you would need help. Whenever I feel a bit better I try to do as much as I can on my own. But even so, mom is getting paid for helping me. \n\nSISTER - I know what you have I\u2019m just saying relax and kids are not easy. Thanks for letting me know. You don\u2019t have to defend yourself over something you know nothing about.\n\n\n\n",

He called my mom a \u201cstupid fake a</em>* b**ch\u201d and terrified the kids and made them cry. Then he kicked my mom\u2019s dog and made him bleed. And I heard everything when he showed up a few days later at 4 AM pounding on the front door and yelling. So, sorry I have ears and can hear! I may not be able to control what my parents do in their own house. But no one can sit there and say this behavior is normal and healthy. My mom has told me multiple times that she doesn\u2019t want my niece staying the night. Key word ME not my sister. She always complains and vents to me about what\u2019s stressing her out. Been this way since I was a little girl. It becomes MY problem, too. So, my bad for trying to defend my mom. It backfired anyway.\u00a0</p>\n</div>",
