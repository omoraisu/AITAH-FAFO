      "selftext": "me (21,F), my boyfriend (22,M), and our two friends (both male, also in a relationship with each other), hangout often. the two friends are known for being late often and i always react badly when it happens. \n\nmost recently, i told one of them, let\u2019s call him Barry, to come over at 8pm so we could have time to watch a movie and do an activity. he read it at 3pm. at 8:15pm i still hadn\u2019t heard anything. i texted asking if they were coming. nothing. 30 minutes late at 8:45 i ask again. nothing. \n\nmy boyfriend was making dinner and he was waiting to finish when they responded so the food would be ready for the movie. at 8:50 i get fed up and say \u201cokay nevermind let\u2019s do it another night i want to eat dinner\u201d\n\nimmediately i get a call from the other of the friends, call him Simon. he asks me what\u2019s up. i tell him i\u2019ve been texting Barry all day and heard nothing so i assumed plans were cancelled. Simon asks if they can still come over. I\u2019m very upset at this point having waited for an hour for them and ask to call him back. i discuss with my boyfriend and decide tonight isn\u2019t the best night as we have a trip tomorrow morning and i was relying on them being on time to watch the movie. when i tell Simon this, he gets upset, saying he really wanted to watch the movie and i should\u2019ve texted him rather than just Barry. they are in a relationship so i had been assuming they would have communicated. Simon said that Barry didn\u2019t see my texts because he had been in the shower (for 45 minutes? when he knew we had plans?)\n\ni understand i could\u2019ve texted Simon but my boyfriend says Simon is manipulating me. Simon made it sound like it was my fault that i didn\u2019t want to hang out with them after they are an hour late. \n\nAITA?",
