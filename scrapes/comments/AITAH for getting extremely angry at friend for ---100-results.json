      "selftext": "Earlier today, there\u2019s a group chat with A, D and myself. It\u2019s about yugioh. A and I play and talk shit all the time, and today was no different. It\u2019s always about who is better. At one point, A said something like \u201cI\u2019ma fuck your mom\u201d or something, to which I was gonna say something, and he said \u201cat least I can get hard\u201d or something similar. This honestly hurt me a lot. I have been struggling with mental health and substance abuse for several years, and this is a new consequence of years of drinking plus strong medication. \nThis whole year I\u2019ve only hooked up a couple times, and I\u2019ve shared this with A. I told him it really is affecting my self steem and I can\u2019t blame anyone but myself for my problems but it sucks. It was like the cherry on top a couple weeks ago that I needed to pick up a beer and binge drink for a week to end up in detox for 8 more days which concluded with losing my job and leaving my sober living. \nI probably said this in front of D, about low libido, who is also in the chat. I\u2019m working on switching meds that don\u2019t mess with libido or lower dosage, one provider even suggested testosterone booster even though my Testosterone level is fine. \nSo A apologized but really feels like gaslighting me into making me look like I\u2019m \u201ctoo emotional,\u201d and that I\u2019m making too much of a big deal out of this. I think it\u2019s fucked up that someone who I felt I could be confident enough to tell something so personal, would turn around and use it against me in an argument like that, and in front of D (or same group chat). I\u2019m gonna add links https://imgur.com/a/QIBBiSF",
