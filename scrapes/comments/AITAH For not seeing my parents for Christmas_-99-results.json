      "selftext": "So, for the past month, I\u2019ve been \u2018gently reminded\u2019 by my parents to arrange my Christmas visit, because apparently, \u2018December 25th\u2019 isn\u2019t a flexible enough date for them. I told my mom it all depends on how much PTO I have left at work, but I could squeeze in a visit the weekend before and even sacrifice one precious PTO day to spend an extra 24 hours with them. She then proceeded to hang up on me, and now refuses to speak to me. Oh, and did I mention she lives over 1000 miles away? So now, I\u2019m essentially being ghosted by my mom for trying to make it work. Merry Christmas, I guess? AITAH?",
