      "selftext": "I (22F) don't have an amazing relationship with my family, but I don't feel comfortable cutting any more contact with them than I already have, just living almost two hours away from them and not really texting them more than necessary.\n\nBut that leads me to today, when I was at their house earlier to help babysit my brothers. The day went mostly okay, or as okay as twelve hours worth of breaking up fights between two rambunctious tween boys (10M and 13M) for no pay can be.\n\nWhen our parents finally got home, I stuck around for a couple hours more to just chat, and also to let my parents settle in a bit before I left.\n\nAnd chat I did, not just with my recently-returned parents, but with my brothers too. Which is where I made my mistake... So, it's a running joke in my family to call somebody (or just a body part of theirs, like their face) a random household object, such as a towel or a couch cushion. In the middle of one of those jokes, my (13M) brother asked my dad for some Ritz crackers, to which I cut in and said, \"you're a cracker,\" without really thinking due to how fatigued I was.\n\nFor those who aren't versed in the connotations of calling somebody a cracker: a cracker is a colloquial that originally referred to a whip-cracking slavemaster.\n\nMy parents proceeded to blow up the moment I had said that, meanwhile my (13M) brother awkwardly just grabbed the crackers and left the room. Well, I say \"my parents,\" but it was mostly my mom, who is white and also a firm believer in the concept of reverse-racism. My hispanic dad mostly kinda just jokingly went \"wooahhh\" before shit actually hit the fan, after which he silently just nodded his head to whatever my mom said.\n\nI didn't really say much as I was berated, besides replying to my mom's pointed question of \"Do you know what 'cracker' even means?\", but all I could think about was how my parents both feel no shame in saying the n-word (including the derivative that rhymes with what you would call a baby pig) in the comfort of their own home, and with the full knowledge of what they're saying, at that.\n\nI know two wrongs absolutely don't make a right, but was I truly an asshole for what I did? I've been thinking about that ever since I left.\n\n**tldr: In a family of non-black people who feel no shame in using the n-word, I jokingly called my 13-year old brother a slang term denoting a slavemaster on accident, and I was met with backlash.**",
