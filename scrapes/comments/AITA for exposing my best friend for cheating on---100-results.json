      "selftext": "Throw away since it is fresh \n\nThis happened recently, and I\u2019m still struggling with whether I did the right thing. My best friend, Jeff, was getting married to Jessica, someone he\u2019s been with for six years. They\u2019ve always seemed like the perfect couple, and Jessica has been nothing but kind to me over the years.\n\nAbout a month ago, Jeff had his bachelor party. It was a small gathering with just close friends at a bar, nothing wild. That night, Jeff disappeared with a woman he\u2019d been flirting with most of the evening. When I confronted him the next day, he admitted he had cheated with her. He laughed it off, saying it was \"just a bachelor party thing\" and that it didn\u2019t mean anything.\n\nI was disgusted and told him it was a massive betrayal. He brushed me off, saying I was overreacting and to keep my mouth shut because \"what Jessica doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt her.\"\n\nFor weeks, I wrestled with what to do. I tried to talk to Jeff again, hoping he\u2019d come clean on his own, but he doubled down and told me to mind my business. As the wedding approached, I couldn\u2019t shake the guilt of knowing Jessica was about to marry someone who had been unfaithful.\n\nThe day before the wedding, I decided I couldn\u2019t stay silent. I went to Jessica privately and told her everything. She was devastated and canceled the wedding immediately.\n\nJeff is furious with me, saying I destroyed his life and ruined our friendship. Some mutual friends are split\u2014some think I did the right thing, while others believe I should have stayed out of it and let them work it out.\n\nNow, I\u2019m questioning myself. Did I overstep by telling Jessica? Should I have just stayed out of it? AITA for exposing Jeff?\n\n\n",
