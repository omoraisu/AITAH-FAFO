      "selftext": "Every holiday is so stressful for me.  My (41F) anxiety is through the roof every time.  My mom and sister just make it absolutely miserable for me.  My sister shows up late with Starbucks coffee in hand and sits and texts with someone while she is \"helping\" me cook, so it appears like she would rather be other people. She usually starts a fight with someone so she can storm off and leave right after we eat dinner and she takes a bunch of leftovers with her.  My mom has a separate property that is about 30 minutes from her house and about 45 minutes from my house.  She has 2 horses and a bunch of farm cats that she feeds.  She never rushes to feed all of them on Thanksgiving, Christmas, or Easter when I end up hosting Thanksgiving dinner.  My husband (43M) ends up watching the boys (well, sort of.  I end up having to yell for him to go look for them.) and I end up doing all the cooking by myself until my sister finally arrives.  I usually end up making a 30 lb turkey, 10 lbs of mashed potatoes from scratch, 5 boxes of stuffing (Stove Top now to save my sanity a little bit), croissants that roll up and bake yourself, and 2 pans of green bean casserole. Furthermore, my mom expects me to cook food for 40-50 people, so we have leftovers for days for us and her and my sister. There's usually less than 10 people that come.  My in laws come sometimes. My mom will pitch in on buying stuff but she won't pitch in to help on anything until the very end and then she acts like I'm a psychopath when she finally does show up hours later . She usually shows up about time for us to start serving lunch. My sister is the exact same way. She'll tell me she'll get there early and help me with the cooking but then she doesn't show up until 10:00 - 12:00pm.  We usually eat lunch at noon or so. The last few years I've been a witch and told them I'm not starting cooking anything until they get here. Then they get upset because they want to look at the Black Friday ads and go Black Friday shopping that night.  My mom has tons of stuff in her kitchen (think hoarder) so there would be no way to do it at her house.  Table is covered with crap and counters are covered too. There is literally no room to cook or to eat dinner. It is plenty big enough but she just has too much stuff everywhere.  My sister also lives with my mom so she can't host.  I end up beating myself up because I think to myself how many more holidays will I have left with my mom. She's 66 years old.  My sister is 33 years old.  I just hate the holidays.  I have a special needs child who is autistic and kinda verbal but still requires a lot of help. He is 9 years old and not potty trained.  We also have a 6 year old too.  My mom always insists upon having my husband go with her to the farm to help with the animals. She goes every other damn day by herself but on the holiday she expects someone to help her.  I don't let this happen. What would you do?  I would love some advice.  \n\nEDIT: This year, we had family that invited us over and my mom and sister are saying they aren't going because they live about an hour away.  My response to them, \"Oh boo fucking hoo\".  I'm going early to make mashed potatoes and green bean casserole and help the host cook since I know how overwhelming it can be.  Then my mom asked me to go help her at the farm before we drove out there and she wanted to ride with us rather than drive her own car.  Hell no.  Tired of this shit.  ",
