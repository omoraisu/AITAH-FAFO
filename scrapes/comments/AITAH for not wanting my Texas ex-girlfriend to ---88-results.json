      "selftext": "I (23F) have a son who is 2 now back in July we sadly lost his father (21M) in a motorcycle accident and, I didn't take it well at all I just wanted to stay. Instead of saying home and laying in bed I worked hard to save up money to move away. I didn't plan on telling anyone I just missed my family at that point and needed them and, for the next 2 weeks it seems fine. We all went to his body before they animated him for the actual funeral, I was kinda help with his friends and invites. Then his family started taking Grace's (not real name) (19F) word over mine I knew him for 4years long. They just didn't seem to care about my word they kept taking her word over mine. Which made me feel uncomfortable welcome like they didn't llike me as much as they liked her. They didn't really get to know her tell about then and, she knew him for about 7-5months. So yes I was being a bit childish for that but, not as childish I was when I posted something. I'm not the best at cleaning and I will own up to that but, I can clean up well then I really get going. I'm saying this because this is the reason why we broke up in the first place. \n\nWe did work at the place as well and some of his work friends new me pretty well so, I did make a few friends with his friends when I started working there after he moved out. We would also talk sometimes about our son and our pets that we had together still. When he passed away I took the 2 days off I was allowed for grievance then I came back everyone was very supportive. They allowed me to take a few minutes to myself if I needed it as well, and it wasn't easy working there after he was gone. I was sitting one day waiting on something when one of our mutual friends that I'd always see him talking to walked up to me and, she told me I feel like you need to know that you should that he always talked about you and no one else. He would always talk about and say my baby mom takes such good care of our kid and, said he still loved you very much he was always looking at you with love. That made me feel sentimental and very emotional so I posted something on of my social media accounts, just saying I wish I was a better gf to you and I'm sad but happy to hear you still loved me. After posting it I didn't think much about then not even 30 seconds later he's ex was blowing up my phone. Grace was saying he didn't love you anymore you need to get over him and move on he never talked about you, you need to take the post down. So I told her what he said to me very bluntly, I said he was planning on moving back and breaking up with you anyways. So we had a bit of a cat fight over texts until. I said well you won't have to worry about me and my son anymore anyways because we are moving to my home town. Grace instantly started to back track saying no you don't have to do that I don't mind you guys. So I told her what she wanted to hear. Posting about him here and there still not saying anything about moving. Then the funeral happen I was back to my nice self not being bitchy letting her think she was okay in my book. Then after the funeral and stuff I told Paul's family I don't want Grace around my son then, a few days later they said don't do this her she needs him so I told them what they wanted to hear. \n\nI still didn't tell them I was moving until the last day of work by that time it's been about 4 weeks I told them that night after I got off work. The very next morning Paul's brother was there trying to guilt trip me into keeping my son there while I move. I told them that is not happening they started doing it every single day and, I still didn't comply then they started being rude about my family. Just for some context my family is poor and can't afford long trips, so they didn't come to see my son when he was born. They just wanted me to leave him there they said he's the last thing of Paul we have completely forgetting about cleaning out my house of all of his thing. He used my house as a storage unit I didn't really mind it after he was still nice to me. They took pretty much everything but the things he left to me I hide all of that. Then when the day it came to move Paul's family looked all through our son's baby stuff and, asked me what all Paul had purchase for our son so I told them. Then the started taking toys that Paul purchased for our son saying you don't need them so I had to ask them not to take all of them because he still needs them to play with. They did help a bit with the moving process but only with the small stuff that was left that was Paul's. When my mom and brother came it we got most of it out and my mom cleaned up pretty well and my brother was a big help with moving things. It took us about 7hrs to get everything out or at least as much as we could before we had to leave it was 2am by the time we decided to leave. So when I went to go get my son it was not in the car because, Paul's family decided to lock there door so I had it knock/bang on there door for them to open it. So I could tell them hey we are leaving could I please have my son so about 15mins later the brought him down. Then another 15 minutes to say goodbye to him which was fine, when we finally left they it felt like a big weight lifted off my chest finally going home I felt happy. AITAH?",
