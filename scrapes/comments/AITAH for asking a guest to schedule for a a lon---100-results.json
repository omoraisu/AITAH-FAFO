      "selftext": "I (23F) am a waxer. I specialize in Brazilians, but do full body waxing. I\u2019ve been doing this for a year and half.  I see anywhere from 3-10 Brazilians per day. Male brazilians are scheduled 30-45 minutes and Female brazilian\u2019s are 15-30.  \n\n2 days ago I had a guest come in who booked for a female Brazilian. I took them back and prepared them, came back in and right when I took away the sheet I immediately noticed that I couldn\u2019t tell what exactly I was looking at. I deal with genitalia all day and have had every kind of anatomy. I honestly was trying to figure out if this was a male or female area while cleansing the skin and couldn\u2019t figure it out, which is fine, the most important part of my job is making my guest feel comfortable. \n\nI am no doctor but from what I saw was what appeared to be an oversized clitoris (or maybe the tip of a small penis)and the outer labias but no vagina. I assumed I was working with an intersex person. The other hard part, was that this person didn\u2019t \u201clook\u201d female or male.\n\nThis person took me 40 minutes to wax, mostly because their anatomy was harder to work with.  I feel awful even typing this because I sound so rude but I have no other way to describe it. Men\u2019s waxes sometimes take longer because their scrotum is more sensitive and we have to prepare the skin better with the kind of wax we use. This person\u2019s (appearing to be) outer labias had skin that was similar - it was wrinkled. The micropenis or clitoris was harder to work around. Again, I am not a medical professional, just a safe person who deals with peoples body\u2019s, so I do not know what or how to describe these anyway else. I am really sorry if I sound stupid. \n\nAnyway, before I left the room I let them know that the next time they book, just to book for the 45 minute brazilian and not the 30. I noticed the look of confusion on their face and explained that everybody has different anatomy and some people just need some extra time. This was me trying to be sensitive to how they identify. (I also was thinking about my coworkers, specifically the ones who are not signed off on men\u2019s waxes, because we wait to train those until they are completely ready. I didn\u2019t want them to be booked and not feel prepared for this person.) \n\nThey pretty much replied \u201cYou want me to book a service meant for a man?\u201d and I said, \u201cNo, I want you to book a service where you are taken care of, comfortably, in a allotted time that works for us as well\u201d. They were visibly upset that I was saying this and have now contacted my boss stating that they felt unsafe and judged by me. I feel really upset. I had a great convo with them during the wax, I thought I built trust, and it was thrown away. I do not judge peoples body\u2019s. It\u2019s part of my job to help people realize that there is absolutely nothing wrong with the way they look. In their description to my boss they wrote, \u201c..made me embarrassed of my identity.\u201d \n\nI have seen HUNDREDS of people and I am now so worried that I waxed someone whose anatomy was just a bit different. I tried to handle it but I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t even know if I am making sense right now. My boss seems understanding of my situation but also so disappointed in me. I don\u2019t want to make people feel this way, but I was also trying to think of my coworkers who might be taken back. I don\u2019t know. AITAH?",

                        "body": "While I love the de-gendering aspect of it all, the training for male versus female genitalia is specific with most waxers taking time to get trained on male. It would mean that not everyone could do the intake appointment or you may end up with a worse situation where you have someone not trained for your genetalia either waxing you or having to pass the appointment along to someone else. I think that would end up being a worse situation. \n\nI think the answer lies more in the fact that the person who got waxed in the OP is super sensitive about their uniqueness and no matter what was said, probably would have been upset. \n\nFor safety, what if the waxer (not OP) hadn\u2019t underwent the male training and then hurt the person with their inexperience? I understand that this person got their feelings hurt (while OP was trying their best to create a safe space for them) but they could have easily gotten their body hurt by not acknowledging the fact that they are different and that they need an experienced waxer with knowledge of both anatomies, and time to also do the job correctly. What is the salon had tried to rush OP?
