      "selftext": "My wife (33) and I (35)have been together for 5 years total. She\u2019s pregnant with her 3rd baby, my first. She has 2 kids from a previous relationship (same dad, her now deceased ex boyfriend). They\u2019re 8 & 9.\n\nShe was with her ex off & on for 10 years, since she they were in high school. The reason for the \u201coff\u201d periods was because he was a drug addict. Thats what killed him. Died of a massive OD. She wasn\u2019t a drug user. She rarely even drinks alcohol. He wasn\u2019t a major drug user when they met and started dating either, but they\u2019d been dating for a few years by the time he started using harder drugs and she was already \u201cin love\u201d with him by then & basically destroyed herself trying to get him to get clean.\n\nSo they had 2 kids together but he was never really an active parent. He went through periods where he\u2019d get clean for a while and was able to be more involved, but never stayed that way. He always maintained contact with them, but it\u2019s not like he had custody of them. I\u2019ve been the stable father figure in their lives and I did my best to respect that he was their dad and they loved him, did what I had to do to help facilitate the relationship while also keeping the kids safe.\n\nHe died and she was really devastated. She told me she\u2019d never get over him and that he was the real love of her life. Things got worse after that for a while but eventually she went to therapy to deal with years of everything he\u2019d put her through and things were really going well. \n\nThis baby was intentional and our whole family is excited about it. She\u2019s not quite 22 weeks now. We just found out it was a boy at the 20 week ultrasound. About a week after that is when she told me she wanted to name the baby after her ex. I told her hell no, sorry. We already had a few boys names we\u2019d talked about and both liked. We also previously agreed that to keep things fair we wouldn\u2019t use a namesake name from either side. I have important people I\u2019d like to name my son after too, but we agreed no namesake names. \n\nShe said it\u2019s just really been in her heart to do this and she knew I\u2019d be upset, but I should know how much he means to her. She\u2019s also trying to use the excuse that it\u2019d be something nice to do for her kids and it\u2019d mean a lot to them. They\u2019ve both suggested names, but none of those names have anything to do with their dad\u2019s name. \n\nWhy would I ever want to name my kid after a junkie who couldn\u2019t take care of his own kids? Who my wife says she\u2019ll always love?\n\nSo she asked if she could just use the same initials as her ex. No! I\u2019ll always know that my kid\u2019s initials are a tribute to this guy. She says I\u2019m being petty and jealous. Maybe I am but I stand by my petty jealousy!\n\nSo, do you agree with her that I\u2019m being petty? AITA for refusing to allow any part of my kid\u2019s name be in any way a tribute or reference to this guy or am I picking the wrong hill to die on? Would any anger I feel about it be less than whatever happiness she and her kids would feel about it, meaning I should just do this for their sake and I\u2019m an asshole if I don\u2019t? \n",

She isn't just mourning him as he was, she's also mourning the life they could have had if he'd been the man she *wanted* him to be.

She would be better off finding something more related to that loss.

She either can&#39;t give you that, or won&#39;t.  It isn&#39;t petty jealousy.  She refuses to move past him.  I am willing to bet you that on some level, maybe even a level SHE won&#39;t consciously admit to, you are simply a space filler for her ex.  You provide the stability.  You provide the Dad.  On some level she may even love you, but you will never be number one.   Until she can leave the ex in the past and let him rest, you will be the third wheel in this relationship.</p>\n</div>",
