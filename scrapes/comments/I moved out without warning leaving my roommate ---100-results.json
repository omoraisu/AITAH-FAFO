      "selftext": "I 29f had been looking for a place because my apartment kept flooding. I found a single mom 24 looking for a roommate ( I myself am a mother but I have an open adoption, I am active in their lives they just deserved more then I could provide for them) When I moved in we had agreed to split the bills in half because she was pregnant with her 5th baby and her man had left her. About a month after I moved in he moved back in and I had asked her if we could split the bills 3 ways. She agreed that we could revisit it when he started working. He refused to get a job the entire time I was there because he didn't want to pay bills also. Rent was $1,800 total with a $800 electric bill, $250 water and sewage. In total I paid $1400 a month in bills. She would lose her shit and would constantly scream 24/7. Threatening and hitting her kids. Calling them derogatory names (i did make an anonymouscall to cps).  She also didn't work and her parents paid her half of the bills and also agreed rent should be split 3 ways. One night while I was doing my laundry She took my clothes out of the dryer and threw them on the floor while they where soaked. When I went to get my clothes out of the dryer I also realized they where on the floor but also had an amonia odor coming from them. I finally lost my shit and she tried bringing up that I don't have custody of my kids or try to get my kids for weekends. And I told her I don't trust her around them and I refuse to expose them to mentally unstable women who cuss out, degrade, and hit their kids because they cannot control their behavior. I moved out while she wasn't home to move into my own apartment (which only cost 600 a month all bills included). She has started blowing up my phone telling me I owe her for rent and utilities and she is facing being evicted because I didn't give her time to find a new roommate. I responded that she cannot find a roommate because Noone is going to split her bills in have when there are two other adults and 5 kids that they are paying half of the bills for. ",
