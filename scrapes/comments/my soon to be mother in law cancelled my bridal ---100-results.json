      "selftext": "i\u2019m just so lost, im getting married to my childhood crush and best friend next year in may, the wedding will be in haw\u00e1ii ( where he lives ) and we invited strictly close friends and family. we went over our limit of 200 people so there is no room for extras, now, a new family moved to there church and they grew close to my fianc\u00e9es family, not my fianc\u00e9e, but his mom and sister, they are even living with his sister. \n\ni think what makes me upset is that the new family automatically assumed they were invited to my wedding even when not being close to the bride or groom, they haven\u2019t even shot me a text saying they were excited to meet me, they were helping my soon to be mother in law plan the bridal shower, and now that they found out they are NOT invited my mother in law called it off, she said if they aren\u2019t at the wedding, then they won\u2019t be at the bridal shower, she doesn\u2019t want to un-invite so her solution is to call it off, i\u2019m meeting with her today to talk about this, any thoughts? \n\nthere is more to the story with my relationship with them, when they hosted an engagement party, my soon to be sister in law wore white, everyone knows white is for the soon to be bride and groom, when i found my wedding dress, they had nothing but bad things to say and which ultimately made me back down from my dress. \n\ni just don\u2019t know what to do ): the bridal shower was to welcome me , to introduce me to make friends but i don\u2019t know anymore, they also made it seem like the invite was a ticket to friends and if i don\u2019t invite them i wont have any friends\n\nedit : thank you all for the support and the advice, i will be meeting up with her to have a discussion , i\u2019ll update when i can\n\n\nEDIT 2 : so i met up with my MIL, she brought her sister AND her niece, who begged to be in my bridal party, the niece is my age and she gave me nothing but dirty looks and attitude, my MIL didn\u2019t let me give a word in, she claims they were invited and she didn\u2019t want to hurt there feelings by simply admitting she made a mistake, then she went on and bashed the food i want at the wedding, hie my fianc\u00e9e and i have bigger problems to worry about, etc, later in the evening i got a text from SIL which reads \u201cHey so I was informed today that your friend is going to do your make up and you still wanted to get your hair done, however since you never reached back out to me after our conversation we already booked ours and I can\u2019t make anymore changes so you will have to find someone to do your hair.\u201d , keep in mind she said my hair and makeup would be a gift, i asked her when is the deadline to book back in september and she never told me, but i for sure told her i wanted / needed my hair done, and now she leaves me in the dark??\n\nshe is part of the bridal party, it is a bridesmaid job to arrange it for the bride, now she put the responsibility and more stress on ME, my sister and brother in law told me this family is going to make my life miserable \n\nEDIT 3 : i responded to my sister in law a with a ss regarding our chats, and told her that it\u2019s okay and thank you anyways, then she responded with snapping with me with a HUGE paragraph stating she doesn\u2019t like my vibe how it is competitive, how I need to work on my communication ( when she didn\u2019t get back to me), how she wants respect from me and no snarky remarks, how she is willing to try for a good relationship with me but there\u2019s a lot of work to be done, and so on",
