      "selftext": "didn\u2019t mean to break his camera\u2026 okay, maybe I kind of did. But seriously, I couldn\u2019t take it anymore. My brother has this habit of filming *everything*. At first, it was harmless\u2014random family moments, sunsets, whatever. But now? It\u2019s like he\u2019s some wannabe director, shoving that thing in everyone\u2019s face 24/7.\n\nThe other day, I was having a rough time and told him I needed space. What does he do? He storms into my room with the camera rolling, narrating like it\u2019s some nature documentary. \u201cAnd here we have the grumpy older sister in her natural habitat\u2026\u201d I told him to stop. He didn\u2019t. I told him again\u2014louder. Nothing.\n\nSo yeah, I snapped. I grabbed the camera and smashed it onto the floor. The room went dead silent except for the sound of him gasping. \u201cWhat the hell?!\u201d he yelled, picking up the pieces like they were his precious little baby.\n\nI just stood there, hands still shaking, and muttered, \u201cI told you to stop.\u201d He started ranting about how I owed him a new one, and maybe I do. But honestly? Maybe now he\u2019ll finally get it. Or not. Knowing him, he\u2019ll just switch to his phone next time. Great. Can\u2019t wait.\n\nAm I the asshole for breaking my brother\u2019s camera?",
