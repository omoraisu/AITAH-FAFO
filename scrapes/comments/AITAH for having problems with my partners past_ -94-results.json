      "selftext": "M35/F29 - Am I the asshole for not being able to get over my gf\u2019s past? We\u2019ve been together for multiple years and I\u2019m still having a hard time with some stuff that happened early on. We\u2019re happy right now but inside I think I have bottled stuff up to keep peace. \n\nWhen we first met, she informed she had a previous billionaire boyfriend that she had 3ways with and went on lavish international dates with. \n\nI\u2019m a kinky guy and have had my fair share of experiences, but nothing like she did with this one guy. Early in the relationship, pre making it official, she was offering similar kinky situations and suggested we have threesomes with her friends but it would always somehow not happen. \n\nAbout a year into our relationship I caught her messaging the guy, who lived out of state, but had no real evidence anything happened between them other than an exchange of texts. She deleted and blocked him in front of me. \n\nI had also caught her in some lies about previous partners, including not telling me she was HSV1 positive **when she knew she had it**. \n\nSince this time, and my confrontation, I\u2019ve had a great time with her and am otherwise happy. \n\nBut I\u2019ve wanted to explore more kinky stuff with her, including 3ways, but she said she\u2019s happy with our sex and that was just part of an experimental phase. Any hint of wanting to explore that with her is shut down. \n\nTo me, it feels like she was giving preferential treatment to her previous partner who was far wealthier than I am. She insists this is not the case, but I can\u2019t help but feel that way. I thought I was over it and have told her it\u2019s fine. \n\nWe are now discussing spending our lives together and while I\u2019m very happy with her I can\u2019t help but hear a voice in the back of my head still sifting through these topics. \n\nAm I the asshole for not letting it go or wanting to pursue those kinks? Do I just need to talk to her more directly about it? ",
