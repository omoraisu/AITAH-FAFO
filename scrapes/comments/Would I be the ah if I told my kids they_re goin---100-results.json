      "selftext": "My ex told me 2 weeks ago that his fiance was 32 weeks pregnant. He still has not told our kids aged 11 and 5. He already puts them second to the fiance and her daughter, and doesn't see ours as much as he should. I told him 2 weeks ago that they at the very least deserve time to adjust to such a big change that will certainly affect them. \n\nHe saw them today and still said nothing so I texted and asked when. Now he's saying they will tell all the kids in the first or second week of December which would put her around 36/37 weeks. This is so incredibly dysfunctional. \n\nSo, would I be the ah if I tell him that if he doesn't tell them tomorrow, I will?\n\n\n\nUpdate: Thanks, everyone, for your opinions. As some suggested, I've decided that I'm going to reach out to the school psychologist and my therapist for their opinions on how I should proceed. My 11yo is emotional and is already feeling sad about how things are going with his dad, so I'm concerned he's going to have some big feelings. If dad doesn't want to tell me a reason for hiding a life changing thing, that's on him. I just wish he would do the right thing by the kids for once. There's so much more to this story and very little effort from dad to be a part of their lives outside of his limited scheduled days/times. I consistently have tried to get him to be more involved, and so has his mom, but I can't make anyone be a better person for their kids. If I do end up being the one to tell the 11yo, I will do it in a positive way and make sure he knows I'm available if he has any big feelings or concerns or even excitement. I'd love to have a good relationship with them, but they've made it impossible and difficult at every turn. It's really hard to coparent when the other parent won't let the kids sleep over because they are a \"disruption\" and said that they aren't his kids when it's not his scheduled day/time. I just want my kids to be happy and feel loved by both their parents and the significant others, but I can only ensure that on my end.",

I was a \u201cnew mommy\u201d at one point, and to make it worse- my ex\u2019s Ex Wife was *very* controlling and withholding of the children he and she shared. He had two sons, 7 & 14 when I got pregnant, and he was not allowed to see them (per her, not court ordered) unless he went to *her* house while she and her new husband were there as well. \n\nWell, her new husband was also my ex\u2019s previous best friend since childhood. He wasn\u2019t even sure if the 7 yr old was *his* because of the timeline of them getting together. So imagine your wife leaves you, then moves your bff in and makes him the \u201cnew daddy\u201d and then *demands* that you spend time with all of them like one big happy family. Yeah, it was still very raw for my ex when we met, so he hadn\u2019t seen his sons in months. \n\nThen I get pregnant, and his ex wife starts telling the children horrible things about their father like, \u201cSee he doesn\u2019t love you. He doesn\u2019t care about any of us anymore. He is starting a new family and replacing you two with a brand new baby.\u201d She also spread it all over Facebook. I couldn\u2019t help but feel incredibly guilty that he wasn\u2019t seeing his sons, yet he was the most amazing father to *our* little boy. He did see them once when our son was almost a year, the kids got dropped off at his mother\u2019s for a day and he took our son to meet his boys. \n\nBut after that I honestly can\u2019t tell you when he saw them next.. it was years later. Because his ex was *infuriated* that he brought his \u201cnew baby\u201d to meet his half brothers. *I wasn\u2019t even there.* He would call to talk to them and she wouldn\u2019t let him. She basically punished her children by taking away their father, thinking she was only punishing my ex. It was so fucked up. \n\nBut *I* will always carry that guilt like, \u201cWhat if we hadn\u2019t met and got pregnant? Would he have been able to actually be a father to those boys??? Is this all my fault in a round about way??\u201d And now it\u2019s too late because he passed unexpectedly three years ago this month. I finally met the boys at the viewing, they\u2019re all grown now and the oldest sees what the mom did and hates her for it, but the younger one might never understand what happened. He might go the whole rest of his life thinking his dad didn\u2019t love him or care about him anymore. **Fuck that bitch.** What kind of mother would say that to her own children???",
