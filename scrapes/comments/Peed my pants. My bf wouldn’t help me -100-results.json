      "selftext": "\nSo I had a vaginal birth nearly three years ago  and since then I\u2019ve had stress incontinence. Today, I was in class and I was taking an exam. I had to pee so bad but couldn\u2019t leave until it was done. When I finally finished, I peed my pants and it leaked as I went to the bathroom. I refused to leave the bathroom until I had another outfit and my bf refused to help me. \n\nI asked him to buy sweats from the uni gift shop and he refused at first until I sent him money for them (I asked to borrow). He then said he wanted me to walk to the restroom door and I said my pants are covered in pee there\u2019s no I can do that and he said he\u2019s not walking into the women\u2019s restroom. I told him to hand it to a girl walking in and he wouldn\u2019t. He eventually left them outside the door to the restroom and I had to walk out in pee pants.\n\nI\u2019m furious with him. Do I have a right to be? ",

Emergency rain ponchos, extra gloves, hot hand packets, and ear muffs for when the weather turns? Bug spray and sunscreen because no one ever remembers to put it on before. Tylenol, Motrin, and Pamprin. Instant heat packs for cramps. Pens and paper. Gum. Glasses wipes. Baby wipes. Hand sanitizer. Lotion. A&D cream. \n\nI always bring an insulated big water jug filled with ice water and snacks in case anyone needs it. An external battery for when phones don't have charge. That isn't counting my handy dandy binder with all the names, parents info, rosters, schedules, cheers, etc written out in case something goes wrong with my phone. \n\nBasically once I have a situation I'm not prepared for, that item gets added to the bag. Now I feel like Mary Poppins but my kids always have what they need and we can get back to the business at hand. Most importantly, they know I'm thinking about them and I care about them and I think it makes them feel safe in a way. \n\nTheir parents definitely comment about my \"magical bag\"!  \n\nI keep stuff my daughter outgrows in my game wagon and those extra poms, bows, body liners, uniforms, sweaters, leggings, etc get given away when someone needs them and I can go \"here you go and just keep it\". \n\nFor half the year my bag is in my car so I'm always willing to share with whoever needs it...

He later told me he had never seen so much blood before. He has a strong stomach too. Poor guy\u2026 </p>\n\n<p>it happened AGAIN not long after he cleaned the bathroom. I could feel the blood overflowing my pad and didn\u2019t make it in time. he had to do the whole thing again. He just helped me in the shower and I couldn\u2019t stop apologizing because I felt so bad he was cleaning all of that \u2639\ufe0f</p>\n\n<p>He just comforted me the entire time.</p>\n</div>",

He could literally be 5 hours from needing to wake up for work and he'll still comfort me and get me new clothes or make sure I don't fall in the shower after everything happened.

And when he gets home he always brings me a small snack or a sprite so I at least have some hydration that isn't dark soda.\n\nWe're not even married and the \"in sickness and health\" is taken so literally by him. He shifted one of his goals (kids) because he doesn't want me to suffer like with my last pregnancy. He'd rather just have me (and if a kid happened from failing BC he'd leave the choice entirely mine if we kept it). I mean with him kids would be nice but he's said biological isn't a huge matter to him. We could always foster and then adopt. He'd rather not put my body at risk just for the sake of biological continuing stuff. His family finally stopped asking us when we were gonna have kids due to both time and the fact I started sharing about my hidden disabilities that are genetic. \n\nI can somewhat understand OP's bf's POV. It's a girls bathroom. He could have gotten another female to help. Or even have a teacher on standby as he slowly entered the bathroom yelling \"special delivery!\" To make it clear he's not there for his pleasure if other women were there. Then hand the pants over, or leave em on the bathroom counter and ZIP his way out while thanking the teacher for the assistance to making sure nobody walked in on a boy in the girls bathroom in this circumstance. Shit happens. And in that moment because it was caused by what I assume is (medically documented?) A disability he is your helper in that moment. With assistance people doesn't matter the gender. As long as they do what they gotta do in the moment it is needed.\n\nI gave birth when I was 18, few days before turning 19. I still have issues with occasionally pissing myself if I cough too hard or worse yet have an asthma attack. \"If my allergies are bad, I wear a pad\" has become my life motto. On my period is even worse because I can't tell if it's from my bladder or just sweat or a squishing of blood. I'm 25 now and still feel the effects of after I gave birth.",

Up to 40% of women who have given birth experience some degree of urinary incontinence, and it affects roughly 25% of women overall. It can be linked to pregnancy, childbirth, frequent extended urine retention, sexual trauma, weight, and other health conditions.

I can't overstate that.* \n\n\u2022 Buying the sweats: \n\nYou're rite. The BF bought the sweats 4 her. Which, I think now, MAY have been more difficult 4 him than dick-ish. I'm not sure. \n\nOP's 1st paragraph says, \"he refused to help me\". In the next, she shares that he wouldnt 2 buy them until she sent him money...and then he did. \n\nHmm. Could he have been broke? If so, I could get on board with him needing the Venmo. \n\nI try hard 2 keep a balanced view when reading. But what you saw in my comments (and I believe, in other people's comments) was a suspicion that altho' he eventually assisted her, she'd had 2 really push him from the very start, 2 get him 2 do so. \n\nAs I associate her statement \"he refused to help me\" with him pushing back about the cost, I get the sense that perhaps his delay wasn't due 2 lack of funds - instead, maybe it began as a flat-out refusal, which then backed down into \"I don't have the money to purchase these\". \n\nDOES OP CLEARLY STATE THIS? No. \n\nCould I (and many others) possibly have been 2 harsh on the BF? Maybe. Maybe not. We don't have enough info. \n\nSo let's look at what we DO have: \n\nEvery time I look at this anew, I always come back 2 OP stating, \"he refused to help me\", as she's introducing the situation. Why would she make this over-arching statement, unless there was more going on than what's detailed? \n\nPeople are often upset while writing posts here. When they're still \"in the moment\", they're usually unable 2 share every single thing that happened, because their anger affects their focus. \n\nOP sounds absolutely LIVID in her post, which makes me think that she tossed off the 2 pieces of the experience that were hitting her the hardest at the time she was posting, but that these were by no means the entire story. \n\nWithout having more specifics, we're each going 2 pull in our own past experiences -- as well as our prejudices. Mine definitely influenced my comments; I imagine yours did the same. \n\n\u2022 The man-being-at-the-entrance-to-the-women's-bathroom situation: \n\nYou're adamant that the BF wouldve been harshly sanctioned by entering the women's bathroom. (Im consolidating what you shared in successive comments - probably badly, sorry!)\n\nUnless he was waving a gun in the hand NOT holding her new sweats, I truly don't believe that wouldve happened. \n\nShe states that she finally agreed 2 wait 4him at the bathroom entrance. Which means she wouldve verbally stopped anyone who potentially might have looked like they were going 2 freak out, by telling her/him/them that SHE'D ASKED HIM 2 meet her there because SHE'D ASKED HIM 2 bring her some badly-needed clean clothes. \n\nIf necessary, she'd likely add that he was STRICTLY dropping them off - he was NOT entering the bathroom. \n\nNow, had she stated that she was NOT  going 2B at the entrance, even tho' he was planning 2 meet her there (maybe instead, she decided 2 wait inside, until he texted), your concerns would be more valid. \n\n\u2022 The BF's reluctance 2 bring the new sweats 2 the bathroom: \n\nIf he had never B4 needed to wait 4 someone by a woman's bathroom, the idea of entering one or waiting near the door might have been somewhat or VERY uncomfortable. \n\nOP didn't expect the BF to balk at this! But I can understand why he would, if this was a brand new situation he was being asked to deal with.\n\n(To everyone who shared about their awesome partner who's done this & more, I get it! But we're individuals, with different backgrounds & expectations.)\n\nThat said....he needed 2 take a deep breath & HELP HER. He loved this woman & obviously knew she had a medical issue. What she was asking him 2do was not unreasonable. \n\nThankfully, he eventually got it 2gether & did so. \n\nI do think, however, that given his level of uncomfortable-ness, she shouldve just agreed 2 meet him at the bathroom entrance from the start. \n\n(Yes, it sucks 2 walk out in pee-soaked clothes! More so, with strangers in the bathroom. But at least OP was in the bathroom & not out in public.) \n\n\u2022 Me saying that the BF would probably never buy tampons:\n\nThank you 4 making me re-look at this. I jumped on him, without being as balanced as I profess 2 be. \n\nI pulled in my past experiences & my prejudices & all but pronounced him an asshole. \n\nAs Ive said b4, I think there's more 2 this story than we've been privvy to! \nI still have the feeling that he balked at getting the sweats, period. \n\nBut Im open to being wrong. \n\nI *am* heartened that he eventually bought the sweats & got them to her! It wasn't easy & it wasn't simple, but she finally got what she needed. \n\nI really hope that he & the OP can talk thru this situation in detail, whether alone or via some sort of counseling (perhaps offered by the uni). \n\nBecause *IF* they can set aside the time to carefully listen to each other...and if each of them can fully share & then fully explore how the other experienced this day, then YES, I could see him buying tampons when needed. \n\n(Sorry this got so long, m/soccer.

Most guys like to be given tasks so they feel like they're needed. And you needed him, and he kinda sucked at providing what you asked. \n\nPersonally, I don't think he's ready for a relationship.
