      "selftext": "\n\nI (28F) work in a male-dominated office, and I\u2019ve always tried to be professional and keep my head down. But there\u2019s this one coworker, \u201cJohn\u201d (53M), who constantly singles me out with rude comments\u2014always framed as \u201cjokes.\u201d\n\nAt first, it was subtle. He\u2019d say things like, \u201cOh, careful, you might blow away in the wind!\u201d or, \u201cYou should eat something; we don\u2019t need you fainting on us!\u201d I\u2019m naturally slim, and I\u2019ve dealt with comments about my weight my whole life, so I just brushed it off.\n\nBut then it escalated. He started calling me \u201cStick\u201d or \u201cTwig\u201d in front of others. Once, when I brought a salad for lunch, he constantly commented on it.\n\nThe breaking point came during a team meeting when he said, \u201cLet\u2019s not give [my name] any heavy assignments\u2014she might snap in half!\u201d This was in front of our boss and a client. I was mortified, but I didn\u2019t say anything in the moment because I didn\u2019t want to seem \u201cemotional\u201d or unprofessional.\n\nAfterward, I pulled John aside and told him his comments about my weight were inappropriate and made me uncomfortable. He smirked and said, \u201cJeez, don\u2019t take it so seriously. It\u2019s just a joke\u2014you\u2019re so sensitive, no wonder people have a hard time working with you.\u201d\n\nI went to HR the next day and filed a formal complaint. Now, John barely acknowledges me, and some of my other coworkers are acting cold toward me. One of them even said, \u201cYou really couldn\u2019t take a joke? You just made things awkward for everyone.\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t want to cause drama, but I also feel like I shouldn\u2019t have to put up with being humiliated about my appearance at work. Am I overreacting? AITAH? ",
