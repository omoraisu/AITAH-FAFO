      "selftext": "[My previous update](https://www.reddit.com/r/AITAH/comments/1f7qwy7/update_3_aita_for_calling_my_fathers_wife_a_creep/)\n\nI'm happy to announce my daughter was born two weeks ago. She arrived a little earlier than expected, but she's perfect. My older kids are in love with their baby sister. And as much as I didn't plan to have a third child, I am truly glad I did.\n\nAs I mentioned last time I posted, my husband and I didn't announce the sex in advance when our first two kids were born. This time, I decided to give my father a heads up. After I found out about the whole \"girl mom\" thing, I became worried about how Sasha would react to the news I was having another daughter. Telling my father ahead of her birth would give him more time to prepare.\n\nSo about a month ago, my father told Sasha I was having another girl. As expected, she didn\u2019t take it well.\n\nA few days after I gave birth, my father told me that he and Sasha were separating. They\u2019re not sure about divorce, but he thinks that\u2019s where they\u2019re headed.\n\nSasha started talking to my father about having children around the time I made my last post. According to him, they started fighting about it when she tried to convince him to get his vasectomy reversed (I didn\u2019t know he had one).\n\nMy father said Sasha cried when he told her I\u2019d have another daughter, and they decided to separate a few days later. I\u2019m not very informed about the situation, but my father did state that the decision was mutual.\n\nAbout a week ago, Sasha texted me. It started with her congratulating me for my daughter\u2019s birth, then evolved into what seemed like a farewell letter to my children.\n\nNot much about them stood out to me (though \u201cyou\u2019ll never understand the love I feel for your children\u201d was an interesting statement). She talked about how much it hurt to know she\u2019d never meet my baby, or watch my daughter become a big sister. Sasha told me I had \u201ctortured\u201d her by keeping my kids away, and it was that distance that made her accept she \u201cneeded\u201d to be a mother.\n\nShe deleted the text a few minutes after I finished reading it. I decided not to reply.\n\nI haven\u2019t been thinking much about the situation lately, but the more I do, the dumber I feel for not realizing Sasha wanted kids sooner. I remember she started talking about my father\u2019s future grandchildren long before I got pregnant with my son. Her behavior around my daughter (at least before the Disney trip) always felt weird to me, but I still never made the connection.\n\nI still don\u2019t dislike Sasha, but I think she brought this situation upon herself. As much as I recognize my father is far from innocent, he\u2019s always been very clear about not wanting more children. Sasha is 47 years old, and while I don\u2019t think I\u2019d want to have kids at that age, I know people who have. If that\u2019s what she wants, then I wish her luck.\n\nWe're also officially moving to Europe in 2025 (the work-related news I mentioned in my previous update were really, *really* great). My husband and I had been hoping for an opportunity like this for a while. We're helping the kids make arrangements to maintain contact with their friends (luckily, my daughter\u2019s best friend is my goddaughter).\n\nThis will be my last update. I\u2019m busy with my baby, and I\u2019ll definitely have a busy 2025 as well, so I don\u2019t intend to write about this anymore.\n\nI want to thank you all for the advice, reassurance and kindness you have shown me. Happy holidays!",
