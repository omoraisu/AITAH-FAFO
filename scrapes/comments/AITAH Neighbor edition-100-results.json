      "selftext": "For starters, I (18M) live in a rough neighborhood. The day started as normal, wake up, yadayadayada, all well and good. I went to get my mail around 10ish am this morning, I see my neighbors super friendly dog who is exorbitantly neglected running free. I called the animal control to advise them so they had it. For reference, Noone was home, this set of neighbors are what you would find living in a trailer park except they live in a nicer house. I walked the dog back home and hooked her up, cool, back to normal. Anyway, at about 1030pm, I arrived home from work to see the dog back loose. I took the dog home and knocked on the front door, I heard alot of yelling and stuff being thrown around and the parents fighting so I waited for the neighbor to come out. A few minutes later their kid (6M) walks out in nothing but gym shorts. I gave the dog to him to go inside but while i was outside he left the door open so i peeked around to see the current conditions, Theres no windows on the residence, its filled with junk, and the yard is a mess. I was concerned for the wellbeing of the 2 kids so I called the state police and they sent a trooper to investigate. AITAH?\n\nUpdate 1:  \nThe state police gave me a call back this morning advising that there will be a court date set, Bail is set for 1000 dollars, and DCFS did start another investigation. My state particularly is not very strict on animal neglect so I dont think it will get far. Charges of Animal Neglect, Child Abuse, Domestic Violence, Assault less than murder, Several failure to appear warrants, Property Damage (They rented), and Maintaining an unsafe environment for Children. Total of 11 charges. Arrest was made about 10:30 or so this morning, 2 troopers and a county sheriff pulled up on em getting ready to leave, possibly even trying to flee. ",
