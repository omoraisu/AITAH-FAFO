Either monitor your credit report with Credit Karma which is free or open accounts with  all 3 credit unions and freeze your credit, which can also be done for free;  I do both of these things.   Do not allow yourself to be caught  slipping, don&#39;t play with your credit. Your parents seem just shitty and  entitled enough to screw you over financially if they got the chance.</p>\n</div>",
