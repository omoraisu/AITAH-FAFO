      "selftext": "I (16M) am in my junior year of high school and I plan to move to a different state for university immediately after I graduate. Almost two years ago, my family dog, Lucy, passed away from old age. We got her when I was around two years old and I honestly do not remember what my life was like before her. When she passed everyone in my family was devastated, but almost immediately my dad started talking about getting a new dog. I was surprised for two reasons:\n\n1. He barely paid any attention to Lucy when she was alive, and it was entirely our (me, my mom, and my siblings') job to feed, walk, and hang out with her.\n2. My mom had very clearly stated she did not want to get a dog for a while after Lucy's passing.\n\nI was obviously pretty upset that he was already talking about getting a new dog and confided in my mother that I was NOT ready for a new dog and was still actively mourning the loss of a dog I loved and lived with my entire life. My mom told me that we were not getting a new dog and I had no reason to worry, so I let it go.\n\nFast forward to a year ago, my dad continued his antics trying to get a dog even with my mother saying no. I don't feel safe telling my dad that I don't want a dog because I am not emotionally prepared and I asked my mom if they could wait until I graduate to get a dog. She once again reassured me that we were not getting a dog anytime soon, but this time it was harder to believe. It got worse when she said that we \"probably wouldn't even get a dog until spring at the earliest\" which made me doubtful because her opinions have changed a lot from a hard no to a maybe.\n\nLast night, my mother admitted that my dad found a dog breeder near us that would be a \"good match\" and I clearly expressed that I still wasn't ready. I told her that if they got a dog I wouldn't interact with it, take care of it, etc. I said that I would have no harmful intention or anger towards the dog at all, I just don't want anything to do with it. She said I was being childish and selfish and I should \"prioritize the needs of my family\". \n\nI wouldn't care if they got the dog after I moved out, I just asked if they could wait. I don't feel like this is an unreasonable request, but I wanted to make sure I'm not being biased. So, AITA?",
