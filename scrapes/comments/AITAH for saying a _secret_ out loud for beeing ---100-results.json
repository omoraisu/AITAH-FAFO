      "selftext": "Hello guys, im (m/late twenties) in a hobby football club with about 20 people (everybody mid/late twenties). There is this one couple which is always bullying me for various things (beeing clumsy, shy and for never having a gf).\nToday we had an early christmas party and there was this couple again.\nThe problem was i was late about 30 min. and there were no more seats exept for one next to the couple.\nSo i sit there and the first thing i'm greeted with is again some stupid comments. I already said to them to shut up and they didn't listen. So in my head i'm like \"fuck it\" and said the \"secret\" everybody in this group knows already \"at least i'm not together with a guy who cheated the day before christmas last year\". FYI the girl in the relationship also knows she was cheated on. The girl then proceeds to go to the toilet and cry. The guy said to me a few minutes later that i should apologize to her which i didn't do. I then said \"why should i apologize if you are always bullying me, first things first you guys should apologize to me...\"\nMost of the group was stunned that i said the \"secret\" out loud, some of them said it was totally inappropriate.\nAITA for saying this?\n\ntldnr: because i was angry for beeing bullied i said a \"secret\" of a couple on an early\nchristmas party everyone already knows about?",
