      "selftext": "I (38F) have a 15-year-old daughter, \u201cEmma.\u201d For her birthday, I decided to throw a small gathering at our house with her best friend, Mia, and a few family members. My brother, \u201cEvan\u201d (45M), offered to help out. Emma adores Evan\u2014he\u2019s the \u201ccool\u201d uncle who\u2019s always joking around and treating her like an adult. I\u2019ve always been uneasy about how permissive he is, but I never imagined he\u2019d cross such a massive line.  \n\nThe evening started fine with music, snacks, and laughter. At one point, I stepped away to finish some work, trusting Evan to keep an eye on things. About an hour later, I went to check on them. I couldn\u2019t find Emma, Mia, or Evan anywhere. After asking a few guests, someone said they were in Emma\u2019s bedroom, \u201cplaying board games.\u201d I had a bad feeling about it, so I headed upstairs.  \n\nWhat I walked into made my stomach drop. Mia was half-passed out, slumped on the bed in Emma\u2019s room, barely able to sit up and throwing up all over herself. Emma and Evan were hovering over her, both panicked and trying to keep her awake. I immediately demanded to know what had happened. Emma looked petrified and didn\u2019t say much, but Evan\u2014calmly, almost nonchalantly\u2014admitted he had let them drink.  \n\nWhen I pressed for details, he shrugged and said Mia had had about 600ml of vodka. He said it like it was no big deal, casually adding, \u201cIt\u2019s fine\u2014I was supervising them.\u201d I was horrified. Mia was barely conscious, struggling to even breathe properly, and Evan acted like this was normal.  \n\nI called an ambulance right away, and Mia was rushed to the hospital. The doctors confirmed she had alcohol poisoning. Thankfully, she\u2019ll recover, but the situation could have ended far worse. I was shaking with guilt, fury, and disbelief.  \n\nWhen I got back home, I unleashed all my anger on Evan. I told him he had crossed an unforgivable line by putting two 15-year-olds in danger. He tried to justify himself, saying teens are going to drink anyway, and he thought it was \u201cbetter\u201d if they did it around him. He even smirked while saying it, which made my blood boil. I told him to pack his things and get out of my house immediately. I also told him he\u2019s not welcome around Emma until further notice.  \n\nWhat crushed me the most was when Emma later admitted, tearfully, that this wasn\u2019t the first time Evan had let her drink with him. She begged me not to cut him off and said I was overreacting, claiming Evan didn\u2019t mean for things to go so far. She also blames me for \u201cruining her birthday\u201d and won\u2019t speak to me now.  \n\nI\u2019m devastated and furious all at once. I feel like I failed to protect my daughter, but at the same time, I can\u2019t just forgive Evan for what he did. Emma doesn\u2019t see it that way, though, and thinks I\u2019m being unfair.  \n",

Also why is Evan alone in a room with two 15 year old girls??? Who are drinking to the point of alcohol poisoning??? I don't know many 45 year old's who would allow themselves to be in that sort of situation..",

Am I completely off thinking she drank almost an entire bottle of vodka? \n\nI come from a place with a lax alcohol culture and teen drinking is still a thing here. It's legal for teens to buy beer when they turn 16. In my teen years it was way crazier than now (hence why THOSE parents became more strict themselves!).\n\nAt 14-22 I'd have no problem drinking more than a bottle of 40% alcohol but I'm not saying that is something to aspire to! But it was the norm when I grew up and we were pretty good at looking out for each other so I don't have any insane stories that went completely and tragically wrong. \n\nI also think it's still the norm for kids to start drinking at home under the supervision of their parents to make sure they drink responsibly and there's someone there looking out for them while they find their tolerance. It still seems healthier than the \"kick out of the nest\" a lot of cultures do at 18 while saying \"you're an adult now, YOU are in charge and can start trying these things out on your own\". BUT! It's the parents (and laws) that need to set the limit for their kids! NOT the \"cool uncle\"!\n\nI've been pleased to see that the gen after mine drinks more responsibly and they started later. The most important, if you ask me, is that they find a way to cope with teen-akwardness on their own and without alcohol. My generation would drink for courage instead and that absolutely sets a trend for life. It's been a completely different experience to see young adults who's learned to cope with feeling akward without numbing it. They'll often drink until they get tipsy and giggly but it's rare for them to even get to the point where they black out. \n\nI'm the somewhat cool aunt and I'm honestly more worried about drugs and rape. I keep telling the kids (in front of their parents) that I'll happily do all the drugs they want with them - when they're 25-26yo and their brains are done developing and if they DO want to try drugs, ffs, please wait until that point! I think that tactic works better than actually forbidding it outright but we'll see what ends up happening. \n\nWe talked about our biggest fears for the kids last weekend and the biggest one was rape, be it drug rape or any other kind. A rape victim said she felt trapped at the place she was at and thus got raped so the new rule is this: If you ever feel uncomfortable, call an adult. ANY one of us! Or call a cab, even if you can't pay. We'll pay whatever it costs when you get here, just get yourself safe and out of situations you're uncomfortable with and we'll deal with the details, like payment, later. \n\nI'm saying all of this to kinda highlight the difference between Evan and the crew of \"cool aunts\" I know. He doesn't seem to actually care for her safety or wellbeing and wtf did he THINK would happen when getting them drunk in their own home with parents that have different attitudes and rules regarding drinking?! He seems to have no ability to risk-assess that we adults CAN actually do when we're done growing up. I would love for those kids to have a cool aunt or uncle but it shouldn't be that dude!

For starters, how the hell would the brother know exactly how many ml of vodka anyone drank? An average bottle is 750ml, like you see at a bar, so you're telling me someone would say 600ml instead of 2/3rds a bottle? No one is giving estimates that precise. \n\nThen there's the addition of checking in on them, because of a bad feeling. Who the hell says that? It's reasonable to check on your daughter and her friend that you hadn't seen in a minute. No one would say \"I had a bad feeling\" they'd say \"just wanted to check on em\" which is normal for a parent. \n\nThen the lack of mentioning anything about authorities, CPS involvement, the friends parents.

It\u2019s OP\u2019s house and was the one responsible for Mia - and Mia\u2019s parents trusted her to be in OP\u2019s care.  </p>\n\n<p>You think OP is gonna be let off Scott free because they weren\u2019t the person who handed over the alcohol and/or gave explicit permission for the girls to drink?  No. Ultimately they were the one who was in charge of Mia. They\u2019re gonna be incredibly fortunate if Mia\u2019s parents don\u2019t either sue them or press charges against them. </p>\n\n<p>This is going to have lasting and severe consequences for Emma too. Mia will likely not be allowed to spend time with her - even if they aren\u2019t at her house. And other parents will follow suit. OP will never be trusted again. Word of this is going to spread faster than a wildfire during a drought.  </p>\n\n<p>This is only the beginning of the consequences that will hit ALL OF THEM and that they will need to deal with.
