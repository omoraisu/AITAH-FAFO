      "selftext": "Throwaway cause yeah\n\nContext: My sister-in-law (F23) lives in the same house as my wife, who is currently pregnant (F30), my son (M2) and myself (M36). She's an attractive young woman with a small, but decent social media presence, and lives a lot of her life digitally (shit, more so than me, and I've been on the internet since 1997). She's been living with us for the past year, after she had a bad break up, tried to commit suicide, y'all know the deal. In that time (13 months) she has had six... acquantences, I guess? They aren't her BF cause apparently zoomers are too chickenshit to just be like \"I really like you, we should be a thing\" and they pussy-foot around commitment, but that's neither here nor there. In 13 months, she has helped financially the last four, with $200 on a $1600 rent. My wife feels bad about asking her to help with utilities and shit, and white that shit kinda irks me, the thing that really bugs me, is that she always brings  by her \"exclusive\" of the week and has them over.  \nLook, I'm in my mid 30's, I live in fuckin' boonies. I live a calm, quiet life with my wife and son and pets. I like smoking my weed.\n\nI don't like random dudes from the city in rotation in my fuckin house every three to six weeks spending the night, with my pregnant wife and my toddler in the next room over, and my belongings. She meets these dudes on Tinder and shit and idk, I feel like she pays $200 so she should get some say, but at the same time, fuck outta here with $200 if that's reason enough to bring randos to spend the night.\n\nWho the fuck are these guys? I don't know shit about them, and people in America are fucking looney bins, I'm not fuckin around to find out.\n\nSo, AITAH for wanting to tell her: \"hey, stop bringing in your fucking bi-monthly boyfriends into the house were your pregnant sister and toddler nephew live and sleep?\" or am I just a boomer lol :(\n\nEvery celebration or family get-together we have, there's always a new douchebag in the photos and I'm not feelin that, feels hella intrusive\n\nedit: I just want to make it clear, that I don't mind her bringing people over for cookouts or having a social life, or trying to find a partner or even getting laid or anything like that.\n\nI just don't want people that I don't know (particularly men that I don't know) sleeping over at my house, when I have a pregnant wife and a toddler.",

Precisely as you stated, my wife is who knows her mental state best, and she would be able to give a more dimensional perspective on the whole thing. I didn&#39;t express myself to her as I did in this post, though I said basically the same things that I said on this post (tact is always important and I don&#39;t want to cause shit with the people I live with)</p>\n\n<p>Ya know, I don&#39;t want to run her life, nor do I feel any entitlement to tell her what to do or anything like that, its just... I have a toddler and a pregnant wife, and I don&#39;t know these mfs</p>\n\n<p>I talked to my wife about it, I will be talking to SIL about it as well. She knows I&#39;m not the type to try and just impose my will on others, and I know she&#39;s not doing it maliciously, she&#39;s just being a young adult who is discovering themselves. But again (and I can&#39;t stress this enough) I don&#39;t know these mfs lol, at least not enough to feel at ease about them sleeping in my house with my pregnant wife and toddler</p>\n</div>",
