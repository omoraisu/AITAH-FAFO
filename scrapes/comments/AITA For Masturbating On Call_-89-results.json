      "selftext": "I (26M) was on a call with a friend of mine (25F). We have been friends since high school, and still hang out and call a lot. I've had romatic feelings for her in the past. She rejected me, but we mutually decided that we could remain friends.\n\nA few months ago, she was sad, and wanted me to call her to cheer her up. We started calling, and played counterstrike. I died early in a lot of rounds (she's a bit better at the game than me lol) and got bored while waiting for the rounds to end. Without even thinking about it, I started fidgeting with my private parts. I felt terrible about it, but after a while of this, I became aroused. I didn't want to leave the call for this, and I knew that I could quickly deal with the situation, so I finished in a round after I had died. She had no idea that I did this, and I didn't think that it would ever come out and be able to impact our relationship.\n\nLast night, we were playing never have I ever with a group of friends, and the question came up, \"Never have I ever masturbated while talking to someone.\" I put a finger down, and when my friends questioned me on it, I, stupidly, admitted that I had done that on call with her before. When she learned this, she was instantly disgusted with me, and gave me the cold shoulder for the rest of the night. When I got home, I saw that she had blocked me on discord. I've been friends with her for a long time, so this really hurt me, especially because my relationship with her meant a lot to me. I feel like I fucked up something important, and I hate myself for it. I messaged my other friends who were at the party about it, and they all say I'm in the wrong, but I feel like she's slightly overreacting by throwing our relationship away over something so small. AITA?\n\n",
