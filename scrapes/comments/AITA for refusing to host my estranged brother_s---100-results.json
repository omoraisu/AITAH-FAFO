      "selftext": "My brother and I have been distant for years. He cut ties with me after a disagreement over our late parents\u2019 estate. I inherited the family home, while he received a significant amount of money. At the time, he said he didn\u2019t want anything to do with the house because \"it held no sentimental value\" to him.\n\nFast forward to now: I\u2019ve poured years of work and savings into restoring the house. It\u2019s my pride and joy, and I\u2019ve hosted small gatherings here for close friends and family. Out of the blue, my brother reached out, announcing his upcoming wedding and asking to host it at my home.\n\nI was taken aback. This is the same brother who hasn\u2019t spoken to me in years, who insulted me during our last conversation, and who didn\u2019t even invite me to his engagement party. When I asked why he wanted my home, he said it was \u201cperfect for the aesthetic\u201d and would save him money on a venue.\n\nI politely declined, explaining that I didn\u2019t feel comfortable hosting such a big event for someone who\u2019s been out of my life for so long. He exploded, accusing me of being petty and holding onto grudges. Now, his fianc\u00e9e and even some relatives are calling me selfish, saying I should \u201cmove on\u201d for the sake of family.\n\nAm I really in the wrong for protecting my space and boundaries?",
