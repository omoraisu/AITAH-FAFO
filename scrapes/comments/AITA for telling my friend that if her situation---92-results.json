      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I\u2019ve seen a lot of these while on the sub and I just thought I\u2019d ask for advice on here. My (26f) friend (26f) has been in a situationship for about 5 years now. It\u2019s been a situation where they have been on and off for a long time, but the guy has never committed long term. She\u2019s talked about him at length for years and he\u2019s lead her on, calling her and talking to her a lot. She\u2019s been saying she\u2019s gonna cut off the relationship for a while now, and she\u2019s just waiting for a certain point in time. We were talking on the phone and she asked me if I thought he loved her and I said I do, but not enough. I\u2019ve told her this before. I told her it has to do with him more than her. He just doesn\u2019t want to commit. And I guess the next thing I said may have made me be the asshole because I said if you\u2019re not in a relationship now then you probably never will be because it\u2019s been so long. And if he wanted to commit he would have. She got upset and basically said my words meant she\u2019s an idiot and that he never loved her. And I said I didn\u2019t say that and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s true. I do think he has feelings for her but there\u2019s something with him that makes him not want to commit. anyway now she\u2019s upset and I don\u2019t know. Did I go to far? I just want advice about how to talk to her. ",
