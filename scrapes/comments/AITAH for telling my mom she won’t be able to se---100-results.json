      "selftext": "33M. My wife is currently 7 months pregnant with our daughter. The first time she was pregnant, she went into premature labor and had a stillbirth. It was a devastating experience for both of us, but especially my sweet wife. She\u2019s finally getting excited about this pregnancy, but there is a part of her that is afraid to get her hopes up in case something goes wrong. She asks me several times a day if I think something will happen and has been having nightmares about having another stillbirth. Luckily, her doctor says everything is going well so far, and I\u2019m confident everything will work out okay this time.\n\nMy wife and I are from the same town, but live around nine hours driving distance from our families. Right now, the plan is for my wife\u2019s mother to drive up once my wife goes into labor. She\u2019s going to support my wife during the labor and also stay for a week or so after the baby is born to help us get settled.  My wife explicitly said that she doesn\u2019t want any visitors aside from her mom for the first few weeks after the baby is born. She told me wants my family to visit a few weeks after the baby is born and even said my parents could stay in the guest room so they get more quality time with their granddaughter once we\u2019re ready for visitors. I truly just want this process to go as smoothly as possible for my wife in light of what she went through the last time around, and so I\u2019m 100% behind whatever plan makes her feel the most comfortable. \n\nYesterday, I got a call from my mom asking about the birth plan. I explained our current plan, and my mom said that she and my dad would drive up once my wife goes into labor. She didn\u2019t mention being in the delivery room, but said they\u2019d be in the waiting room to meet their granddaughter.  She also said they\u2019d stay at a hotel nearby and so they could spend time with the baby once she\u2019s home.\n\nI told my mom that we\u2019re excited for her to come up and meet the baby, but we\u2019d prefer if she wait a few weeks until we\u2019re settled. My mom said that my MIL is coming up right after the birth, and so she doesn\u2019t understand why she can\u2019t be there. I explained that my MIL is there to support my wife during the labor and help her get settled after the baby is born. I added that my wife obviously feels more comfortable with her mom and doesn\u2019t feel pressure to have the house spotless and be the perfect hostess when her mom comes over. I also said that we want her and my dad to get a lot of time with the baby, and we don\u2019t know how my wife is going to be feeling immediately after the birth. My mom started rambling about how boy\u2019s mom always gets the short end of the stick and everyone should be included when it comes to major milestones like the birth of a child. \n\nThe funny thing is that my younger sister had her first baby about six months ago. She can\u2019t stand her MIL, and she STILL hasn\u2019t given her the green light to come and visit. My mom and my sister have both justified this by saying her MIL is rude and difficult to be around. This is true, but also, my sister holds grudges and doesn\u2019t get along with most relatives. \n\nI responded to my mom by asking why she\u2019s okay with my sister keeping her baby away from her MIL for six months if everyone should be included. My mom was furious. She said that there was more to the situation than I realize and that this situation is completely different since she\u2019s always been perfectly nice to my wife. I asked what I was missing, and my mom just said that my sister\u2019s MIL ruined her bridal shower by bringing her obnoxious friends.\n\nI said regardless of the situation, I want to make this experience as stress free as possible for my wife given what happened last time. I said that she just wants me and my mom for a while, and I understand her perspective. I told my mom I love her and am excited for her to visit, and we\u2019ll make sure she gets plenty of time with her granddaughter. She seemed disappointed, but I thought we were on the same page.\n\nA few hours ago, my wife told me that she got a call from my mother. She said my mom was crying and saying she felt excluded and like we didn\u2019t want her to meet the baby. My wife is a sweetheart and a people pleaser and she truly took this to heart. She seemed stressed and asked me if we were doing the right thing. I told my wife I wanted her to feel as comfortable as possible and that I\u2019d deal with my mom moving forward. \n\nI was furious to say the least. The stress isn\u2019t good for my wife, and she\u2019s already under a lot of it because of her fears that history will repeat itself. I called my mom back and told her that if she calls my wife about the situation again, she won\u2019t get to see the baby for two months. I said I\u2019d add a month for every call after that. I meant this kind of as a joke, but I was being serious that she can\u2019t be putting this stress on my wife right now. My mom said we were excluding her and my father and that they raised me better than this.\n\nMy dad called and said I was wrong to give my mom an ultimatum and punish her for expressing her feelings. He said that I was using time with the baby as a form of control. I explained that I want them to have a good relationship with my kid, but I desperately don\u2019t want any extra stress on my wife right now. My dad says I owe my mom an apology for saying I\u2019ll add months to the wait time every time she speaks to my wife about the birth plan. I disagree. Aitah?",

            "body": "Your story is such a perfect way to illustrate how mothers like this aren't actually upset about the baby. They view the baby as a means of control and an opportunity to do so. \n\nBecause this person flew unannounced all the way across the country to insist on \"seeing the baby\" when their presence wasn't wanted, yet when they received pushback, when they didn't get their way, they decided not to have a relationship with the baby at all. 30 years of silence. That's how much the baby actually mattered\u2013 not at all. In your case it was an opportunity for your mother-in-law to create a situation where you felt you couldn't say no, and leverage it against you.\n\nIn OP's case, It's about the mother using this vulnerability to make it about herself and claim it's about one parent being favored over the other. About *her* being the \"boys mother\" or about *her* importance relative to OP's new nuclear family he has built with his wife. The baby represents a power struggle. A pecking order about who ultimately gets to make decisions and set boundaries when it comes to the family.\n\nMIL has centered herself in a situation where it would already be wrong to do so, but it's highlighted even more by the extensive trauma OP and his wife have already been through. \n\nMothers like this will use things like special events and the birth of new children as opportunities to exercise or reinforce their power and position. They can simultaneously make it seem like it's the biggest snub in the world because of the nature of the event, while not acknowledging that the nature of the event means the focus is on other people and *their* needs and boundaries.\n\nThis is a tale as old as time. \n\nIf his mother wants to see this grandchild she better get her \ud83d\udca9 together",
            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>Your story is such a perfect way to illustrate how mothers like this aren&#39;t actually upset about the baby. They view the baby as a means of control and an opportunity to do so. </p>\n\n<p>Because this person flew unannounced all the way across the country to insist on &quot;seeing the baby&quot; when their presence wasn&#39;t wanted, yet when they received pushback, when they didn&#39;t get their way, they decided not to have a relationship with the baby at all. 30 years of silence. That&#39;s how much the baby actually mattered\u2013 not at all. In your case it was an opportunity for your mother-in-law to create a situation where you felt you couldn&#39;t say no, and leverage it against you.</p>\n\n<p>In OP&#39;s case, It&#39;s about the mother using this vulnerability to make it about herself and claim it&#39;s about one parent being favored over the other. About <em>her</em> being the &quot;boys mother&quot; or about <em>her</em> importance relative to OP&#39;s new nuclear family he has built with his wife. The baby represents a power struggle.

We're lucky that both sets of parents are sub 15 minutes from us, so they could come by for the afternoon, or in my mil's case a heroic 2nd night home overnight shift because I basically hadn't had a rem cycle in 4-5 nights and the exhaustion and pain had wiped me out. \n\nI think if your parents had been lovely about waiting you could have graciously offered a quick trip, staying at a hotel a couple days after you got home - fully a 2 hour visit to meet the baby, then a longer visit in a few weeks,  but they've been jerks about it, so hard nope.\n\nI'd try your dad again in a cooler moment. He seems to feel very protective toward his wife so there's an analogy he COULD understand about you protecting your wife.  How traumatic the stillborn was, how she needs a little time to heal and you could even emphasize the gory bits or how worried YOU are about mother and baby.  Try to keep the conversation on an even keel.\n\nAnyway, your totally right and shouldn't give in, maybe try your dad or a sister to help with your mom.

I actually asked my husband to call and invite his parents because I wanted to thank them for all their support during a rough pregnancy.</p>\n</div>",

I\u2019m in my 30s and he\u2019s 2 yrs younger than me, no kids no full on career. My mother and stepfather are worth money (life insurance &amp; wills) and when I was getting married they said he seemed like the better bet to know the ins and outs of the wills and the paperwork, but in the 10yrs since they have \u201cadmitted\u201d im better suited to that job cause im \u201cstable\u201d and hes not. I was like well of course at first I wasn\u2019t y\u2019all didn\u2019t help for shit. </p>\n\n<p>But anyways yes OP is making all the right moves, look I ain\u2019t religious in any way shape or form, but the only thing I can stand 100% in the Bible is that a husband leaves his family and cleaves to his new one. Screw momma and daddy\u2019s feelings it isn\u2019t about them anymore.</p>\n</div>",

And tell your mom that you did this and she has lost the privilege of having  direct access to your wife. If anyone else in your family tries to harass your wife, they will be blocked by BOTH of you until after the birth. Follow through. </p>\n\n<p>You need to tell your mom she can come visit when the baby is 2 months old. Period. Stop engaging. Stop justifying. Anyone who can\u2019t understand why a woman who lost a child is anxious about giving birth is NEVER going to understand because they\u2019re lacking basic human empathy. </p>\n\n<p>Also, for the record, what your mom is doing is exponentially worse than what your sister\u2019s MIL did. Ruining a bridal shower doesn\u2019t even compare to endangering the heath of your wife and child. Anything less than telling your mom she should be ashamed of herself is kinda gross on your part too.</p>\n</div>",

But then hearing how overbearing mom is being about it and how she tried to manipulate OPs wife, I'm going hard NTA. I personally loved having visitors in the hospital. It broke up the monotony of the day when you're confined to 1 room. \n\nI actually saw a great TikTok video today from an account called theBarrys. The dad was talking about his mom wanting to be in the room when his wife gave birth. The way he explained it was that it didn't make sense for his mom to be there because his wife's mom was being there for HER baby and she just wanted to be there for the grandbaby basically. I was like dang... I've always agreed with dad and mom's mom being the people in the room but when you put it like that, how can you really argue with that. I feel like the logic could be extrapolated to this situation. MIL is going to be around to support HER baby while she transitions into motherhood. Yes, she'll get time with the grandbaby also, but this will be another opportunity where she as a mother will be caring for and supporting her own baby during one of the most vulnerable times of her life.",

If she ever utters that disgusting nonsense again and you know about it, you will leave, disengage, and zero tolerance. It&#39;s not healthy.</p>\n</div>",
