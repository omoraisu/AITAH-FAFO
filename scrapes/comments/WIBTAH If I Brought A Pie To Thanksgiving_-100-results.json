      "selftext": "I WISH i(19f) were joking. but im not, im going over to my boyfriends(20m) familys house for thanksgiving this year. this would be the first time im invited so im very nervous and want to bring something as a token of appreciation. a pie! right? easy, simple, everyone loves pies. well for some reason he thinks itd be rude to do that. weve been together for over a year so idk why it matters. his quotes are \"bringing food to somebody ELSE's thanksgiving? that's rude\" and \"they're the ones providing food, bringing your own indicates that you disagree with their food choices\" and \"I feel like my mom would rather bake one though.... \ud83d\ude2d\" please comment on this so i can show him its not weird\n\nedit: okay so he asked his mom if i could bring a pie and she said \"Of course, but it's really not necessary. She should save her money.\" Lmao so its not a his parents are weird thing, its a HE is weird and thinks its rude. \n\nedit 2: i feel like i need to clarify that i already know what was being made. the only dessert item will be chocolate chip cookies and oreo truffles which is why i thought to bring a pie lol",
