      "selftext": "Travelling in Asia atm and got put into a random group of people from all over the world on a 1 day boat trip. Everyone was nice enough except for a really obnoxious dude who happened to be from Israel. Kept bringing up the conflict going on over there and was asking everyone what did they think about it. Something about his face and tone didn\u2019t sit right with me and when he came around to me to ask my opinion I told him that I\u2019m on holiday trying to enjoy a place that I\u2019ve wanted to visit since I was a kid and that I don\u2019t really care. He then said \u201coh so you\u2019re anti semetic?\u201d \nAnd I replied \u201cit depends on the Semite in question. Jewish people in general? No. But tbh I think you\u2019re a bit of a cunt\u201d \n\nHe looked shocked, stammered something and quickly moved to a quiet part of the boat and I was happy I could continue my trip in peace. A couple of South American guys I\u2019d befriended said that although it was funny it was a bit harsh so now I\u2019m wondering aitah ",

On Using ChatGPT\n\nFirst, your issue with me using ChatGPT highlights how effective it is as a tool for structuring responses and presenting well-researched facts. It\u2019s here to stay, much like calculators revolutionized math or computers transformed communication. The real question is whether the points I\u2019m making are valid, not the tool I used to help structure them.\n\n\n---\n\n2. The \"Inciting Incident\" Fallacy\n\nYou\u2019re framing the October 7th Al-Aqsa Flood operation as the sole instigator of this conflict. That\u2019s not accurate. The reality is that the oppression of Palestinians\u2014and what Ilan Papp\u00e9 called an \"incremental genocide\"\u2014has been ongoing for decades.\n\n2007 Blockade: After Palestinians exercised their right to self-determination by electing a Hamas-led government, Israel imposed a brutal blockade on Gaza. This act of collective punishment, illegal under international law, devastated Gaza\u2019s economy and living conditions.\n\nGreat March of Return: When Palestinians organized a peaceful protest in 2018 demanding the right to return to their ancestral lands, Israeli forces responded with live ammunition, killing and injuring unarmed protestors. What was their \"crime\" here? Asserting their humanity and demanding justice?\n\nContinuous Settlements: In the West Bank, Israel has ramped up illegal settlement expansion, forcibly displacing Palestinians and destroying their homes and communities. This is nothing less than systemic land theft.\n\n\nTo claim that October 7th was unprovoked ignores this long history of oppression and systemic violence. When peaceful measures have proven ineffectual, it gives rise to credible justification for paramilitary actions like those on October 7th. It\u2019s a desperate response born out of decades of ignored suffering.\n\n\n---\n\n3. Hostages and Negotiations\n\nYou also mention the hostages. It\u2019s important to clarify that Hamas has repeatedly offered to negotiate for their release:\n\nThey proposed deals to release hostages in exchange for a ceasefire or prisoner swaps. These offers were outright rejected by Netanyahu\u2019s government, which shows a deliberate unwillingness to prioritize the hostages\u2019 safe return.\n\nHamas even offered to release some hostages unconditionally due to medical conditions, yet Israel continued its campaign of mass violence instead of taking the humanitarian option.\n\n\nBlaming Hamas entirely for the hostage situation while ignoring Israel\u2019s role in rejecting negotiations is dishonest. Netanyahu\u2019s government prioritized a genocidal military campaign over diplomacy, effectively weaponizing the hostages\u2019 plight.\n\n\n---\n\n4. The Genocidal Frenzy\n\nIsrael\u2019s response goes far beyond proportionality. The mass destruction of Gaza\u2019s infrastructure, hospitals, refugee camps, and entire families cannot be justified as \"self-defense.\" This is collective punishment on an unimaginable scale, targeting civilians in clear violation of international law.\n\nEven before October 7th, Palestinians in Gaza were living under conditions described by many as \"unlivable,\" with severe restrictions on food, water, medicine, and basic human rights. The current campaign escalates this suffering to genocidal proportions.\n\n\n---\n\nIn summary, your argument ignores decades of oppression and the ongoing genocide against Palestinians. Framing October 7th as the starting point is not only historically inaccurate but also absolves Israel of responsibility for its long-standing policies of systemic violence. Let\u2019s discuss the full context rather than cherry-picking events to fit a convenient narrative.",

Not a moment too soon. And we will be there, helping to dismantle it. Many, many countries from around the world.\n\nArrest warrants were issued. Now it's just a matter of time.\n\nLove, from South Africa.",
