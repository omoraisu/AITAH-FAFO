      "selftext": "I (22M) have a koi pond in my backyard. It\u2019s not just any koi pond\u2014it\u2019s a full-blown, professionally designed Japanese garden with a bridge, waterfalls, and koi that cost more than my car (I\u2019m talking $1,000 for a single fish). Maintaining this pond is my pride and joy. I\u2019ve put years into this hobby, and my yard is securely fenced with \u201cNo Trespassing\u201d signs everywhere.\n\nEnter my neighbor, \u201cKaren\u201d (fake name, but fitting). Karen has a son, let\u2019s call him Timmy (8M), who is notorious for wandering into other people\u2019s yards uninvited. I\u2019ve talked to Karen multiple times about this, but she just brushes it off with, \u201cKids will be kids.\u201d\n\nLast week, while I was out running errands, I got a frantic call from Karen. Apparently, Timmy *climbed over my fence* to \u201cfeed the fish\u201d (even though I have explicitly told him to stay out). In doing so, he slipped, fell into the pond, and destroyed part of my carefully maintained ecosystem. Several of my prized koi died due to stress, and the filtration system was damaged because of the debris Timmy kicked in.\n\nLuckily, Timmy wasn\u2019t seriously hurt\u2014just a few scrapes\u2014but Karen has been *demanding* I pay for his medical bills. She claims my pond is an \"attractive nuisance\" and that I should\u2019ve had a cover or something to prevent kids from falling in. I argued that (1) it\u2019s a private, fenced property, and (2) her son had no business being there in the first place.\n\nWhen I refused to pay, Karen lost it and started badmouthing me to the whole neighborhood, calling me \u201cheartless\u201d and a \u201cterrible person.\u201d I\u2019ve since filed a lawsuit against her for the cost of the koi, the damage to my filtration system, and repairs to my pond\u2014over $5,000 in total.\n\nSome of my friends think I\u2019m taking it too far, saying, \u201cHe\u2019s just a kid.\u201d But others agree that Karen should\u2019ve been watching him better. So, Reddit, AITA for suing my neighbor after her kid trespassed and destroyed my koi pond?",

We have to be careful about rights restrictions, which some in this field turn into our version of \"kids will be kids,\" but in my experience, all it takes is a bit of out-of-the-box thinking and a good relationship with your residents, who will usually agree to anything if you explain to them why it's necessary or important.

We handle these things as potential consequences, not as threats or ways to control the residents but as talking points when we explain their rights and responsibilities to them.

It\u2019s not always a sign of bad parenting if your kid does something he/she shouldn\u2019t (even if the kid doesn\u2019t have behavioral issues), but what I will say is a sign of bad parenting is avoiding personal responsibility. \n\nThis is true of anything.

She is autistic w/cognitive delays and a bunch of other issues. \n\nFor years, when she was young, she would only eat certain things. One of those things was bacon. \n\nOne very late night (think 3am ish) there was a huge banging on my door. I was terrified but went to the door anyway to see who was there. Some random dude in a wife beater and sweats has a shotgun in one hand; and MY daughter in the other! I don't know who was more pissed off between the two of them. \n\nApparently she had woken up earlier and had a craving for bacon. Rather than wake me up, she opted to unlock the deadbolt and wander through the neighborhood.  \n\nThat poor man had woken up to a break-in in his home. Armed with his shotgun he confronted my daughter who was rifling though his fridge looking for her favorite food. \n\nLuckily it turned out ok. He was super pissed off; I was terrified; and she was mad. We never did get the full story because she had just started learning to speak and was still non verbal for the most part. \n\nAfter that I had another key deadbolt installed at the top of front door to stop that situation from ever occurring again.  I'd lock us in anytime we were at home. Kept the key with me all the time so she couldn't escape.  \n\nPoint is, we can't watch our kids 24/7. And how do you prepare for a situation that would never occur to you? I just assumed the one deadbolt (it was a twist to lock one) was enough and she had never acted like that before.",

Rather than wake me up, she opted to unlock the deadbolt and wander through the neighborhood.  </p>\n\n<p>That poor man had woken up to a break-in in his home. Armed with his shotgun he confronted my daughter who was rifling though his fridge looking for her favorite food. </p>\n\n<p>Luckily it turned out ok. He was super pissed off; I was terrified; and she was mad. We never did get the full story because she had just started learning to speak and was still non verbal for the most part. </p>\n\n<p>After that I had another key deadbolt installed at the top of front door to stop that situation from ever occurring again.  I&#39;d lock us in anytime we were at home. Kept the key with me all the time so she couldn&#39;t escape.  </p>\n\n<p>Point is, we can&#39;t watch our kids 24/7. And how do you prepare for a situation that would never occur to you? I just assumed the one deadbolt (it was a twist to lock one) was enough and she had never acted like that before.</p>\n</div>",

After the last incident, that resulted in thousands of dollars in damages, Karen took the stance that OP was at fault and needed to pay for Timmy\u2019s medical bills.  She also badmouthed him to the neighborhood.  So it doesn\u2019t appear that she holds Timmy responsible for even that incident.  Her response was to blame OP and he wasn\u2019t even there.  Additionally, he is in no way responsible for watching her child.  \n\nI did look at your responses and do see that you stated \u201cKids fuck up and have to learn boundaries.  That\u2019s part of being a kid\u201d.  But I do not see in your responses where you put any kind of a timeline for a child to \u201clearn boundaries\u201d, how many chances they should be given before disciplinary actions are taken or exactly how they would even learn said boundaries and what is acceptable behavior or unacceptable behavior.  So how is Timmy suppose to learn these things at the age of eight, if his mother does not take action and explain them to him, while also giving appropriate consequences when necessary \u2026 possibly due to repeated unacceptable behavior. \n\nYou did post that \u201cA kid like that needs to get yelled at once or twice and have their parents called when they fuck up, not sent to a God damn shrink\u201d.  I agree that Timmy doesn\u2019t need a shrink. However I think it could backfire drastically if OP were to yell at him \u2026 especially if this is happening in the US.  And OP did call Timmy\u2019s parent, who proceeded to excuse Timmy\u2019s behavior \u2026 multiple times.  So while I was wrong to assume you advocate for infinite chances, you do appear to be ok with Timmy having multiple chances with no repercussions from his mother, as no where in your responses did you post anything about Timmy, specifically, deserving consequences for his actions.  \n\nYour brother did damage, your parents were informed and they immediately applied consequences to his unacceptable actions so that he would learn.  It sounds like they did not give your brother multiple chances for unacceptable behavior.  They did not excuse his behavior as \u201ckids being kids\u201d, multiple times.  Your parents \u201cparented\u201d immediately.  \n\nAnd I\u2019m not sure why you think the Karen in this situation clearly \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d cooperate.  To me it appears that she \u201cwon\u2019t\u201d cooperate.  But I know nothing about her physical or mental abilities so you might be correct in that she \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d cooperate. \n\nConsidering OP has had multiple discussions with Karen about Timmy\u2019s unacceptable behavior on his property, I personally think he has given her a lot of leeway to do some parenting with her child.  At some point, the chances run out for most people, children included, and someone decides they need consequences for their actions.  I don\u2019t agree that OP needs to continue being a part of letting Timmy \u201csomehow\u201d learn what is appropriate behavior.  OP had given Timmy and his mother enough chances and has the right to dole out consequences when his property is damaged.  This whole situation might not have ended up in such a drastic state if Karen had actually given her son some appropriate consequences sooner and helped him to learn what is acceptable, instead of just brushing aside his poor behavior with excuses.  \n\nAlso, I apologize to all Redditors.

We don&#39;t know what the fence looks like, how tall it is, etc. </p>\n\n<p>People can be wild and the fact she&#39;s calling it &quot;an attractive nuisance&quot; would make me nervous. Because that&#39;s exactly what an ambulance chaser would tell someone whose kid fell into a man made body of water in someone&#39;s yard. </p>\n\n<p>Not saying it&#39;s right. Not saying I agree. Just putting it out there as a cautionary. I&#39;m assuming everyone&#39;s heard at least one tale of a person doing something incredibly dumb and getting paid out for it.</p>\n</div>",

It took almost two hours to get police because the white-only pool across the street, and the white-occupied homes around it, wouldn't call for help or let them use their phone.

A koi pond is just another example of that. The fence and gates, paired with the signs, should definitely have been enough. I hope Karen gets hit with the entire cost to replace everything and restore it all to it's previous condition, including the koi, the filtration, and even the plants. \n\nWe had a koi pond, nowhere near as nice or elaborate as this, and we had put some small koi in it, only about 2 or 3 inches. They grew bigger and we got to know them as pets, complete with names. I would have been devastated if something like this had happened, and ours was nothing like OP has described theirs.",

Like I&#39;m talking about my youngest biting me on the neck so hard she drew blood and forced me to drop her on the ground, where she proceeded to pick up a claw hammer and start swinging it at me, all because I was trying to put her into timeout when she refused to go on her own.  She was 4 at the time.  Tell me please, how do you parent when stuff like that happens?  Because it&#39;s really fucking hard and all you get is judgments from people who think you can do better.</p>\n\n<p>We don&#39;t know what that mother is dealing with to try and parent her child at home.</p>\n</div>",

Specifically since the mom mentioned the kid \"feeding the fish\", I am betting that is a major culprit.\n\nTypically the sort of stuff that gets washed into a pond in a storm isn't going to harm koi very much at all. It might still break the filter, but most people with this kind of big system have a back up bubbler they can put in once the storm passes.\n\nHowever sunscreen, lotion, bug spray, soap - anything like that? Surprisingly small amounts can be quite toxic to fish in a pond. The fish-per-gallon ratio is MUCH higher in the wild, meaning that sunscreen and the like is much more dilute as it breaks down when you go to the beach. \n\nOrganic matter that rots quickly - ie, anything a kid would think to try to feed fish - is also a big issue. Basically as it rots, it releases a lot of ammonia quickly, which damages fish gills at amazingly low concentrations. Now of course, fish actually \"breath out\" ammonia, but in an established system this is a non issue becuase bacteria and plants are established that can \"eat\" the ammonia the fish produce. If the rate of amonia production rises slowly - say with the growing size of a fish - the population of bacteria and plants can often adjust to accomodate the avaiable nuitrients to a certain extent. Poop, leaves, that sort of stuff rots pretty slowly in comparison and doesn't cause amonia to rise suddenly and rapidly the way uneaten food would, meaning that the system has more time to adjust.\n\nThat doesn't even mention the potential for spices/food additives that are toxic to fish or the possibilities of mechanical damage. A solid kick from an 8 year old could certainly kill a koi if you got unlucky, and once that fish is dead, it's rotting, which can further sicken the other fish.\n\nHonestly though, carp can handle a lot... Some of them dying over this is kind of wild to me, honestly. There has to be some specific detail that OP left out for brevity that caused the death of the fish IMO.\n\nEdit: Thank you to all the people telling me this story is fake, I appreciate your concern.

I'm not actually that much of a koi person - if I were making a big pond myself, I'd probably have a pair of spotted gar and maybe a catfish or two. \n\nIf you don't mind me going on a tangent, the thing I think a lot of people miss is the huge diversity in fishkeeping - there's like 30,000 species of fish compared to only 5,000-6,000 species of mammal. So when you think of how different mammals like giraffes, feild mice, blue whales and snow leopards are as organisms, realise that fish have just as much (if not more) diversity in lifestyle and behavior.\n\nTo expand, goldfish and koi (which are two species, btw) are popular becuase they're the dogs of the fish wourld. They've been domesticated for literally thousands of years and have a long history as a food source, then as pets and status symbols. I'd also argue betta fish are the cats of the fish world, with their lower space need and obligated carnivore diet, with domestication going back about 800 years or so. While it's hard to argue that cats and dogs aren't great pets, they also aren't super representative of all mammels can be. And yes, a lot of those species aren't really going to do well in captivity, but others will absolutely thrive.\n\nI think more people need to interact with a fish that hates you. If I am honest, that's what got me into fishkeeping. I was in a marine biology class at university (becuase why not) and part of the class was getting assigned a couple saltwater tanks around campus to maintain. One of the tanks had a pair of maroon clownfish in it, and the female was just... So *fucking mean*. On tank maintenance days she would bite the shit out of you and just generally be a nuisance. She was smart enough to recognize people and patterns, too, so her behavior if you were the person who fed her on *not* a cleaning day her behavior would be completely different. She still hated you, but instead of putting on her warpaint and bullying her husband into the back of the tank (to protect him?) she would come up to the top front of the tank and start demanding food. She'd even spit water at the lid and everything, it was great. I never realized individual fish could have that much personality before.\n\nMost other clownfish are sweet as can be, FYI. Though my other clownfish story is from my friendly local fish store. They would take in 'rescue' fish for resale, and at one point had a pair of clowns that I noticed were way, way cheaper than any other similar fish in the store. Written on the front of their tank was \"MEAN! Species tank ONLY! WARN CUSTOMER\"... Obviously I had to ask about them.\n\nApperently these two particular clowns were perfectly pleasant to their humans, but systematically murdered any other fish put in a tank with them regardless of how big of a tank it was. And they were ocellaris, too! To explain, there are several specoes of clownfish and some of them are known for being a bit more prone to agressive behavior, like maroon clowns. Ocellaris as a species are usually pretty meek, though, and tend to stay in a very small section of an aquarium, rarely traveling more than a few inches from whatever object they are 'hosting' to. Typically, they are considered the perfect reef fish, and some people will go so far as to say every tank should have a pair. Hearing these two little fish went on a murder spree in a 300 gallon reef tank, and that's why they were getting rehomed? Simultaneously sad as hell and hysterical. I wish I had been able to buy them tbh.",

Long-time lurker, first-time poster here. So I (23M) share an apartment with my roommate, Ben (24M), and we generally get along really well. The issue is that Ben has this habit of \"borrowing\" my things without asking. He\u2019ll take my food, my shampoo, my chargers, and my clothes, all while saying he\u2019ll \"replace it\" or \"only needs it for a bit.\"\n\nNow, I\u2019m all for sharing, but it\u2019s gotten to the point where he\u2019s eating my favorite snacks that I specifically buy for myself, or using up my toothpaste and never replacing it. I\u2019ve tried dropping hints, like asking if he needs anything from the store so he can buy his own stuff, but he just laughs it off.\n\nSo, last week I finally asked him directly to stop using my things without asking. I told him it feels like my stuff is always disappearing, and I need to be able to count on having the basics around. Ben didn\u2019t take it well, though. He said I was being \"overly territorial\" and that roommates should be cool sharing little things. He accused me of making a big deal out of nothing and said I\u2019m \"ruining the vibe.\"\n\nI feel a bit guilty because it\u2019s true that we\u2019ve always had a chill relationship, and maybe I came off as more serious than I meant. But at the same time, I just want him to respect my things. AITA?\"\n\n  \nMaybe it's just me, but the writing style seems nearly identical to the post above.
