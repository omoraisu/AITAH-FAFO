      "selftext": "(sorry my english isnt very good not my first language) So 2 months ago when school just started i had done 2 quizzes and didnt do that well on them and he found out when he asked to talk to me he came to my house and forced me to talk to him in my houses office closed the door and had his hand on the door handle when he and i were talking he kept interrupting me and progressively got more and more angry and started yelling at me to sit down when i told him no and started calling for my mom because i already felt he was either going to get violent or extermaly and when i told i was not going to sit down he proceeded to force me onto the chair and then started to choke me so i then kicked him away but i wasnt able to get out of the room fast enough and he pulled me by the arm and threw me outside onto my front porch so i ran down the street to where these 2 guys were and told them what was happening and my father came out running threathing to call the police on me again as well as my mom taking me back inside the house and trying to calm me down and i told my mom if he ever tries doing that again i would be calling the police on him and then i now i havent talked to him as much whenever he comes over. So now is where I need advice yesterday he called me as I was asleep before i don't remember everything super clearly but here is what I do remember from what I can recall he called me and talked about how he feels like i don't want to be around him and that he feels lonely because of it etc and then he brought up this propaganda about how the new generating doesn't wanna be with their parents and how no matter what he will always be my father and how that when im older ill realize what he did helped me and that its not his fault for me being depressed its the system's fault and then he asked me if i still wanted to be his daughter and other stuff i don't clearly remember. (if you want a rundown of other stuff in the past that has led up to this i can update)\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n",
