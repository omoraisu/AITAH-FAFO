      "selftext": "I've been dating my boyfriend Jake (fake name) for 8 months and until recently, everything was great. He's attentive, caring, and we've never had any major issues. However, things changed last week after one of my male coworkers (who I rarely interact with outside of work) liked a few of my Instagram posts.\n\nJake saw these likes and started questioning me about my relationship with this coworker. I explained truthfully that we're just colleagues who occasionally chat during lunch breaks with other teachers. Jake seemed to accept this at first, but then he started saying that if I truly loved and trusted him, I should have no problem sharing all my passwords with him - phone, social media, email, everything.\n\nI told him no, explaining that I value my privacy and don't believe sharing passwords is necessary for trust. He got really upset and said that \"people who have nothing to hide, hide nothing.\" He's been bringing it up daily, saying things like \"if you trusted me, you'd share\" and \"what are you hiding from me?\"\n\nSome of my friends say I should just give him the passwords to prove my loyalty and keep the peace. Others are telling me this is controlling behavior and a huge red flag. I'm starting to doubt myself - am I being unreasonable? I have nothing to hide, but I feel like this crosses a boundary.\n\nThe thing is, I really love him and our relationship has been wonderful until now. I don't want to throw everything away over this, but I also don't want to set a precedent that he can demand access to my private information whenever he feels insecure.\n\nHas anyone dealt with something similar? Am I wrong for wanting to keep my privacy? How do I handle this without destroying our relationship?",
