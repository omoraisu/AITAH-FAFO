      "selftext": "My boyfriend and I have been dating for 4 years. We met early on in college and dated the entire time. We graduated last year and have since been doing long distance (7 hour drive away) because we got jobs in different cities. We started talking about plans for next year\u2026 he wants to keep his job and stay where he is. He wants me to move in with him, but I don\u2019t feel ready. I don\u2019t have friends or family where he is and he has friends AND family. I also would be starting a new job. I feel like my lack of support system there would strain our relationship. I also never imagined I\u2019d be moving in with a boyfriend so early in life, I\u2019m 22 years old. I love him but I\u2019m not ready to start this phase of my life. I want this phase of my life to be about gaining lots of independence and making new friends and really finding myself. I feel like staying in the relationship may inhibit that. I feel like a bad girlfriend and I\u2019m not sure how to communicate my needs respectfully and kindly. ",
