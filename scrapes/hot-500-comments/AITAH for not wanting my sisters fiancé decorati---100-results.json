      "selftext": "So I\u2019m 21 male and me and my family still do Christmas traditions right which is fine it makes my parents happy and I am happy that they are happy. We are getting a Christmas tree soon for their house like me and my siblings like every year because it\u2019s fun to do it. This year my sister wants to include her new fianc\u00e9 into the tree decorating, but she\u2019s like with him 24/7 even before they were engaged anything family related it\u2019s them two. She\u2019s 22 and he\u2019s 23. They have been dating for 3-4 years by the way. I want it to be family related only for one more year and my younger brother and other sister agree and my mom agrees. The situation though is that my sister\u2019s fianc\u00e9 is in the Air Force and we don\u2019t know if he\u2019s gonna have to travel somewhere and if he\u2019ll come back. Now I feel bad a bit, but it\u2019s still like a family thing of course next year he\u2019ll join, but I just wish my sister saw it from my p.o.v. Plus we have no ornaments really for him so is it really that important for him to be here. My sister is annoyed and upset with my decision along with my dad, and I don\u2019t really know what to do. I don\u2019t think I am in the wrong though.",

He is her family now, even if they aren't officially married. Families grow and change, your sister might be the first to go through this change but she hopefully won't be the last. Nothing in your post suggests that your sister's fiance is a bad guy, so your objections seem to just be about the changing dynamics. I would suggest that you welcome him now, so that your sister doesn't feel like she ever needs to choose between her new chosen family and her family of origin. Set the tone now for welcoming new family members so your family can grow instead of fracture.",
