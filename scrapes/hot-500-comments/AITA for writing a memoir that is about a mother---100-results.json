      "selftext": "I (16 F) dont have good relationship with my mom, which causes us to have lots of fights over stupid things. But I have a taekwondo teacher who is nice to me and treats me like her daughter. She even gives me gifts on my birthday and comes to my sparring events when my mom isn\u2019t there. So, there is this writing competition, so I decided to write a memoir about that teacher. I had already submitted it, but my mom wanted to read it. And she found out that I was writing a story about a mother figure that isnt her. She asked me to delete it, but 8 said no (it was one of my best writing pieces). Now she\u2019s disappointed with me. So Reddit, AITAH for not deleting the story?",
