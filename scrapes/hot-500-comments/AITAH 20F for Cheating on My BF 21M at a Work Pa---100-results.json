      "selftext": "I\u2019m 20F, working as a front desk representative for an IT company. My boyfriend (21M) and I have been in a happy and intimate relationship and pretty active sexually, but I recently messed up big time, and I don\u2019t know how to move forward.\n\nOn December 5th, my company had a holiday party. The full week and the day of the party, I got super busy with work-related tasks and party preparations. Because of this, I didn\u2019t get to meet my boyfriend, though we stayed connected over the phone and exchanged a few *ahem* spicy conversations. I was pretty horny because since we start we never skipped sex that long and we decided to meet the next night after the party.\n\nThe party was held at a beach city on the East Coast (I can\u2019t name it for privacy reasons). Since employees came from different locations, the company booked hotel rooms for everyone. I had my own room. During the party, I drank a lot more than usual and got pretty drunk. Around 1 AM, I went to one of my colleagues\u2019s rooms (32M) to hang out and play some cards. I didn\u2019t plan anything beyond that, but one thing led to another, and we ended up being intimate and had sex.\n\nIt was a huge mistake, and I feel absolutely horrible about it. I cheated on my boyfriend, and I know there\u2019s no excuse for what I did. I never intended for this to happen, and I feel like I\u2019ve ruined everything.\n\nI don\u2019t know whether to confess to my boyfriend or keep it to myself. I\u2019m terrified of losing him, but I also hate lying to him. I don\u2019t know how to handle this guilt.\n\nAITAH? How do I even begin to make things right after something like this?",
