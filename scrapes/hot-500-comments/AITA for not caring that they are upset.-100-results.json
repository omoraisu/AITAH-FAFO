      "selftext": "A few years ago I was living with my now ex boyfriend. I was 19 F and he was 22 M I am very short while he is over 6 ft. I love swimming especially in the beach and I am a trained competitive swimmer, while he does not know how to swim. There was a day we went to a very calm beach on a holiday with alot of people on the beach and as I usually do, I go out in the deep where I can have peace and swim,float, relax without bumping into anyone. I'm 5 ft tall and if I was to do. A little hop and dive into the water my feet would touch the bottom while my head would be just under the water..that's how deep I was when he decided to come over by me and try to drag me to shore. I said I didn't want to come to shore right now and I'll come and join him and his sister when I'm finished swimming. He said it was dangerous and because I'm fat I don't know how to save myself as well as I could of in my competitive days. I again said I'm don't want to go to shore and I'm okay right now. I continued to swim while I heard a splash and as I turned I saw him beating up in the water and sinking so I swam back to him and pushed him up and he stood on both feet and looked at me panicked. He laughed and said he was fine when I asked him repeatedly and then he went to shore and sat down. On our way home both him and his sister said I was in the wrong to making him go into the deep and nearly Drown. If I wasn't in the deep then he wouldn't have nearly drowned while trying to get me and if something happened to him it would be my fault. AITA?",
