      "selftext": "yes. from the title it may seem like I already am the asshole, but listen to the full story then place your judgement.\n\nso for the sake of privacy ill use fake names\n\nFormer Best Friend #1= Samantha (F, 19)\n\nFormer Best Friend #2 = Ava (F, 19)\n\nMutual friend between me and Ava = Andrea\n\nSo to start the story you need context, so I (F, 19) and my closet friends, Samantha and Ava were inseparable. We did everything we possibly could together given time, work and school constraints. We did family events together, we held met ups at our spot somewhat regularly and generally facetimes, texted or communicated in some sort of way at least once a day. We'd met in middle school and we just clicked everything was good for a long time until Ava's mom suddenly passed away during our junior year of high school. Obviously all of us were destroyed but it didn't help the fact that Ava's dad had went back to his home country a few year prior and now since there was no available family member to take care of Ava and her younger sister there dad wanted them to come live in there home country until Ava turned 18 and was able to fend for herself. This news floored all of us as not only did Ava have to deal with loosing her mom, she had no family support besides a nice church lady her mom knew that helped organize her funeral bu8t she also had to give up on her whole life in America for a couple of months until she turned 18. At the time we were all just a few months from turning 18. We as a collective tried to find ways we could let her stay but her dad was just the worst about the whole thing and so Ava had no choice but to get. Samantha promised her that when she was able to come back she'd have a place at her home and i did as well. We saw her off the night she got on her flight and she was gone just like that. She left Sam with her legal stuff and major things but to me she left the keys to her moms house and car. Now for the first few weeks things were good. she'd call and give updates anytime she could. Some things happened to skip a few chapters where i was to give Andrea (f,17 at the time) (a mutual friend we had shared but i wasn't as close with her as ava was) the keys to the house and the car a lot happened but long story short, i gave it back we cleared the air and it was done.  Fast forward a few weeks and we find out that she returned to the states and was living with Andrea, It was a surprise for both me and Sam but our happiness that our friend was back overshadowed anything. then it came out about something with tickets and money owed and her car being towed from Andreas house. It raised a few eyebrows but nobody said anything. After a few weeks of living with Andrea there was a big fallout between Ava and Andrea's mother where she left there house and came to mine. all was good until my mom had called Andrea's mom to discuss what exactly happened as Andreas mother and mine knew each other from a previous interaction. Some things came out that Ava was being incredibly snake like and talking about me, my whole family and my boyfriend behind my back. At first i was 100% on my friends side and so was Sam. We all decided to ignore it but i wanted to know why an adult would have beef with a teenager. So i called Andrea's mom personally and had a talk with her and Andrea and they told me that they had no reason to lie and laid it out for me. In my mind it kind of made sense as there was a period where Me, Sam and Ava we not on the best of terms while Ava was away. I asked Sam about what to do with the information i had received and she stood behind Ava and brushed it off like it was nothing but an older lady trying to create drama. Me and my moms relationship wasn't the best so in early 2024 i got kicked out. there was a big altercation and fight that Ava was there for. Police were involved and the whole nine. So i was staying with my Boyfriend and i knew i had to get Ava out because my mom was already telling me she had to go once i left. So to make things short Ava leaves my house and is staying with Sam. I was working on getting a new job, phone and getting accustomed to my situation (homeless 18 year old senior with no job, money or real saving and a piece of crap car). So my communication went down with everyone tremendously. I didnt talk to may people besides a few selectr people. I hadnt heard from Sam and Ava since the night when Ava left. I will admit in the day before Ava left i was a wreck and was short and cold with everyone, even my boyfriend which was why when i didn't hear form them i thought that might've been why. fast forward to now and its been almost 10 months since me, Sam and Ava had talked. I tried to reach out a couple of times but i was never given a response so i stopped reaching. Recently i got a state job and i remember the whole ticket situation with Ava's mom so i decided to do some investigating. I found out some really important information that needed to get relayed to Ava but i didn't revive a response so i went to Sam to ask her to relay the information. Sam responded with hostility and told me i ignored them for so long why would anything i say constitute as an emergency to them,. I was perplexed. I didn't know i was ignoring them i thought it was the other way around. I have proof of me reaching out numerous times to both of them over the course of t he 10 month period and i even reached out just a month prior to this conversation to see if they wanted to have a meet up and sit down and talk about everything that had gone down in the last year. My feelings, obviously hurt I responded back at the end of the conversation basically saying \"a connection goes two ways and i never heard from you guys once named I'm not breaking my neck to speak to either of you anymore and ill be the bad buy if you want me to be. If you wan a sit down like adults then that'd be fine but I'm not gonna cry and beg for your friendship over text when all you guys are gonna do is ignore me.\" and i left it at that. Since then i haven't gotten a response and my now fianc\u00e9 (who i am still living with but were planning to buy our home in April of 2025!) says i did the right thing but no matter how things go from now he has my support I've also asked my mom and my cousins (who were there to see the whole thing go down in real time) and they all agree with me and said i shouldn't have even offered to do a sit down with them. I cant help feel like I've caused this rift and id like to close that chapter but its been eating away at me since the conversation with Sam and ive only been left on read by Ava. I don't know how to feel about the whole thing on one side i feel validated and i know that you cant force anybody to understand the hurt you went through  but on one side i feel there was more i could've done to reach out and rekindle our friendship a while back. I really do have so much love in my heart for those two and their the people who i considered sisters i mean we went through, death, mental issues, breakups, middle school, high school, covid and everything in between but i don't know if the memories we once had will overpower the current state of our friendship. so reddit ill let you be the judge, AITA for ignoring my friends for almost an entire year?",
