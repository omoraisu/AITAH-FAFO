      "selftext": "I went away for work for a few days. When I came back my wife had a surprise for me.  She walked me into my home office, and surprise! She had repainted my office. For weeks I had been plastering over dry wall and was preparing to sand it then paint it.  While I was away she decided to take matters into her own hands and she sanded then painted my walls...  \nThe only problem is she didn't cover my computers, monitors, keyboards, furniture with a drop cloth and everything is now coated in white powder.  \nI. Mean. Everything.  \nI was absolutely infuriated when I saw the mess left behind.  The closer I looked I saw paint on the wood floors as well.  I didn't say a word. I turned around and quietly left the room.  \nI went back to my car and drove to the local Wawa where I sat in the parking lot and stared out the window while my wife blew up my phone wanting to know what was wrong.  \nEventually she texted me that I was being a 'bitch' and that I could easily have overlooked the 'mess' she left behind and that it was the thought that counts. I stopped off at Home Depot on the way home to buy cleaning supplies.  \nIt took me four hours to clean my office, and I'm still finding dust over everything and she says I'm petty.  \nAITAH?",
