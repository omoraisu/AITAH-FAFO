      "selftext": "My Sister 32F and I 37M have a great relationship, we are close and share everything that is going in life, she is one of the most important persons to me. \n\nIn Spring/Summer her long time relationship of 7 years ended with all the drama tied to something like this. We are always there for each other and obviously I have been helping her move, lending an ear and getting her set up for a fresh chapter in life. \n\nRather soon after the dust settled she started to get flirty with a coworker of hers who was in relationship at that time. In my role as her \u201eadvisor\u201c i have been onto that ride which ended up being a complete shitshow of non-commitment, him wanting her as a side-chick and a long list of more emotional abuse of a woman who just went through a rough breakup. \n\nIt obviously all ended in tears and we wrote a letter to him ending things (eventho he broke up with his then-gf) and it seemed we found a good conclusion to a rebound fling that sort of gotten out of hand. \n\nIn September however my sister told me that they were in touch again and sort of starting to date once more, for real this time. Thanks for nothing I thought and was ready to pick up the pieces once more. \n\nIt turns out that somehow this became a real relationship with all the \u201ethis time everything is different\u201c talk. It is not my place to judge or influence my sister\u2018s relationship decisions but my wedding is coming up in early summer next year. \n\nToday she revealed those news to me stating it should\u2019ve been obvious to me that sth was going on and when the conversation touched the wedding topic also that she fully expected him to be her +1. \n\nNot only is it kind of a big ask to invite a person that I have yet to meet to my wedding, being my sister\u2019s bf or not, it does certainly complicate things for me when that person has been down almost every road of disrespect (except domestic violence) that I can think of a man interacting with a woman. Unfaithfulness, dishonesty, polygamy and a generally weak and immature character. \n\nMeanwhile I could blink all that away and hope for him to actually be a lot better than my picture of him is as of now, but there is a table of honour at the wedding reserved for the closest family and their spouses and children. Each and every person at that table is very dear to me and absolutely deserves this special place at my wedding. \n\nSo, AITA for not wanting him at that table and not having a better solution to offer?",
