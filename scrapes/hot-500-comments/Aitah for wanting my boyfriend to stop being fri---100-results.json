      "selftext": "I love my boyfriend very much and have almost no complaints about him except one. We\u2019re in 10th grade now but at the time there was this girl in 8th grade we were both friends with, let\u2019s call her Sarah. We were both friends with her but me and my now boyfriend were not in the same friend groups. Just to clarify we were not dating then we only talked sometimes in classes and were friends. I had always liked my boyfriend, let\u2019s call him jimmy. Throughout middle school but never told anyone. One day Sarah was telling us how she liked Jimmy. I was a little disappointed to heard that since they were much closer friends than me and him were. But I never flirted or even talked to him outside and I definitely didn\u2019t try to pursue him after hearing that. Well my birthday party rolls around. It was a sleepover I could only invite so many girls over and Sarah didn\u2019t make into the couple I could pick, because we weren\u2019t very close. She texted me that night being aggressive asking why I didn\u2019t invite her, I tell her I could only invite so many girls. She starts telling me about how she\u2019s going to khs. Me obviously trying to be a good friend spends hours of my birthday sleepover talking her out of it. I later hear from a mutual friends of ours that she wasn\u2019t actually going to khs, but only said that to try to ruin my night. Now I get being upset over not being invited but I personally think she took it way too far. Anyways she was pissing other people off at school and was getting threats. So she moved schools that year. I got with my boyfriend Jimmy towards the end of 9th grade. Everything thing had being going great and it still is for the most part. Over the summer I had learned that he still had contact with Sarah on Snapchat. And they\u2019re friends on instagram and Facebook. My boyfriend has under 30 followers and following on instagram. And very little friends on Facebook. So it a little heartbreaking that she one the only girls he following and that they are that close. I don\u2019t think my boyfriend knows that I know she used to like him. But one night in the summer somehow we got on the topic of her and I expressed I didn\u2019t like her and what she did to me. He didn\u2019t really have much to say. I at least thought he would distance themselves. I didn\u2019t tell him to do that because I\u2019m just not a controlling person. Probably a few weeks after this we were on a date at six flags. We had gotten drinks and sat down at a table. And I just peek over and he\u2019s talking to Sarah. He noticed and just said that she usually just texts him randomly asking how he was doing. I was highly upset and that day and when I got home I cried. I didn\u2019t tell him I was upset because I didn\u2019t want to ruin our date. So I just kinda shoved into the back of my mind. This has always ate away at me. And for the first time recently I opened up to one of my friends about it. She told me that she knows how some girls think and if the guy is still texting her even though he has a girlfriend so still has a shot. And I mean it\u2019s been 2 years since she\u2019s moved schools and they\u2019re still in contact. I also feel that if my boyfriend told me that somebody did him wrong and would hold a grudge for him, but obviously he isn\u2019t doing the same for me. And to add on top of this he knows that she used to like him. My friend said that one day she saw like a insta post from Sarah and was talking bad about her and he defended her and said that she got him through a tuff time when he was dealing with suicidal thoughts. Now I appreciate her helping him but I help him now. I want to bring this up to him so bad but I\u2019m very non confrontational. Also my boyfriend is a very logical person so I think he would just justify the situation and defend her. And I don\u2019t know if my heart can sit through that. Am I in the wrong and should just let it go? Should i confront him? Any advice? Thank you for taking the time to read this.",
