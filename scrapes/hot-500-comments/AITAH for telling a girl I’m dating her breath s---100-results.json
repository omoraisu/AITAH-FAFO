      "selftext": "So a few weeks ago me and the girl im dating had spent the weekend together. We had agreed to a bunch of activities that Saturday morning. She spent about an hour and a half in the bathroom and then I washed up and we headed out\n\nWe got to the first activity and she was speaking to someone and I noticed her breath was EXTREMELY bad\u2026. \n\nI waited until no one was around us and spoke really low to her and the conversation went as followed:\n\nMe: hey, you used mouthwash this morning ? \n\nHer: why does my breath stink ? \n\nMe: nods head  \n\nShe told me today, that she went back home and cried because of what I said !? I\u2019ve grown up where if it\u2019s something going on hygienic or with your outfit or anything the people around would tell me about it and it wasn\u2019t a problem ?  I didn\u2019t think what I said or how I said it would be enough to make her cry ? \n\nAitah ?",
