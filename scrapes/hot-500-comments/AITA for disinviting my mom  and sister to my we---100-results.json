      "selftext": "I (30F) am currently engaged and getting married next spring. My father has spent a majority of my life being an alcoholic and my mother chose to ignore the problem until recently. If I\u2019m being completely truthful, having a parent with an addiction was challenging. It\u2019s hard to not be resentful to both my dad and my mom. I also have a sister (27F). She was impacted heavily by my dad\u2019s drinking. One of her weird behaviors coming from her childhood is needing to be the center of everything. I have many situations where she meddled way too much or got involved where she shouldn\u2019t have. Since we were teenagers, she would get herself involved with my romantic relationships, my friends, and even when I bought my first home. While I still have a relationship with my family, I do keep my distance both mentally and physically. With that being said, I ended up moving halfway across the country which does bother my family at times.\n\nRecently, my dad ended up in a hospital for a major complication with his alcohol addiction. My mom basically gave him an ultimatum and told him he needed to get sober, which he agreed. I stayed in contact with my family and asked my mom repeatedly if I needed to get on a plane and be there. She told me that it wasn\u2019t necessary, and that I needed to focus on work. My sister, who lived a few hours away, did come and help after my dad got discharged.\n\nMy sister and I both have weddings scheduled for next year, and we have extended relatives on my dad\u2019s side that are coming. I\u2019ve been trying to find a good time to tell my dad about their attendance (he is estranged from them). I talked to my mom and we both agreed to give it a few months to allow my dad to focus on his sobriety and then talk to him about it.\n\nI received a text message from my sister today informing me that she told my dad about his relatives being at my wedding. I panicked and told her that I had a plan for disclosing this myself and questioned why she felt the need to do that. She explained that our dad asked her if his relatives were attending her wedding and that she decided to \u201crip the bandaid off\u201d and tell him about my wedding too. I was livid. I got ahold of my mom and asked what happened. I reminded her of the timeline that I had to discuss this with my dad and my mom  claimed she forgotten. After some back and forth, my mom blamed me and stated that if I had come home to be there for my father, that my sister wouldn\u2019t have been in the position to talk about my wedding. Things really escalated, and my current position is that my mom and my sister are no longer invited to the wedding. This is something that I have paid for myself, and this was a personal detail that was not my sister\u2019s to share. My fianc\u00e9e thinks I am overreacting and that I should apologize to them. I think they both overstepped, and will not understand boundaries unless I set them myself. AITA? ",

Just get ahead of the conversation, call your dad, tell him you're sorry he's finding out the way he did and explain to him your reasoning for inviting his family. Tell your sister you're disappointed in her and don't fill her in with other details of your wedding if you don't want them shared. She's shown her true colors. Tell your mom you want news of your wedding to only be announced by you and you hope she understands. Forgive them and have a fun wedding.",
