      "selftext": "Me (31f) went to cirque du soleil two days ago with my mum, younger sister and niece. We had booked the tickets a year ago becuase they always sell out fast. Before I had ordered the tickets I had asked my older sister if she wanted to come aswell with her daughter and she just kept saying 'no becuase my husband might not be able to take time off work so best if we don't come.' I said that's fine. So I had ordered the tickets for my mum, younger sister niece and me. Fast forward to 2 days ago when we went to cirque du soleil we were at the train station waiting for our train so my younger sister took a group photo and put it in our family group chat and my older sister got upset becuase we 'didn't invite her' so younger sister called her and tried to explain the situation to her but older sister started to yell saying you never told me and you planned it behind my back and then she hung up the phone. My younger sister even sent her a screenshot of the messages we had of showing older sister proof that we did talk about it to her but she still is saying we didn't talk about it. My younger sister tried to call her again but older sister would just keep hanging up the phone, then at one point her husband would answer the phone and start yelling and swearing at us for not being good enough to not invite her. At the end of the day younger sister was trying to go over to see older sister and her husband answered the phone and said if you come over I will call the cops on you. So now she won't speak to us at all\nSo aita for making my older sister being upset with the family?",
