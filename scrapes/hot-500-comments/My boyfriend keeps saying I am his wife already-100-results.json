      "selftext": "My boyfriend likes to say I\u2019m his wife already (I always tell him I am not as you haven\u2019t preposed) and sometimes gets me gifts that are fianc\u00e9 related/ centred and he has not proposed btw. I have developed semantic satiation to the word due to its overuse and the fact I keep being called it when the effort or gesture of a proposal has not occurred. Idk I get anxious that I\u2019m being conditioned to accept the bare minimum, I\u2019d rather be called someone\u2019s wife or fianc\u00e9 when I actually am; I\u2019m not a 12 year old child. Should I ask him to stop calling mi  that ? Or am I being too ott ",
