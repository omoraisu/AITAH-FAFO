      "selftext": "I (19M) prefer to keep my distance from drugs, gambling, or anything that can lead to potential addiction. There\u2019s no deep or elaborate reason, just a general fear of addiction ruining lives, I\u2019ve heard plenty of sad stories, and that\u2019s enough for me.\n\nI have a group of friends who are generally mature and rational people, but they don\u2019t share my concern about addiction. They drink and smoke weed, nothing out of the ordinary for people our age. I respect their choices, and they respect mine, so there\u2019s never been an issue.\n\nLast month, I was invited to my friend John's (20M) birthday party, who wanted to celebrate at a casino. At first, I was torn about going, cause I didn\u2019t feel it was fair to miss out on a friend\u2019s birthday just because I didn\u2019t like the place he'd picked, so I decided to bite the bullet and join them.\n\nI didn\u2019t gamble at all while I was there. I just hung out at the bar and watched my friends play, but I didn\u2019t enjoy myself at all. The atmosphere felt tense and charged, and I could see that some of the people there weren\u2019t doing well. I know it\u2019s none of my business, but I couldn\u2019t help but feel uneasy and anxious. I was also pretty bored, since all I had to do while I was there was watch them, or be on my phone. That said, my friends seemed to have fun, and I'm glad they did.\n\nAfter that night, I told my friends that while I appreciated being invited and had fun at dinner afterward, gambling just wasn\u2019t for me, and I let them know I wouldn\u2019t be going again. They didn\u2019t make much of it and just moved on with the conversation, so I assumed everyone was fine with it.\n\nFast forward about a month,  another friend, Aiden (20M), decided to celebrate his birthday at a casino as well. When I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable going and that I\u2019d join them for dinner but skip the casino, he got upset. He said it wasn\u2019t fair that I was willing to tough it out for John but not for him. I explained that I overestimated myself the first time, and decided I wasn\u2019t going to do it again. I also reminded him that I'd already said I wasn't going back after John's birthday.\n\nWe went back and forth, but he ended up telling me not to bother coming at all if I was gonna be a dick about it. I agreed and decided to sit this one out.\n\nThe friend group's split on the matter. Some think that if I could go once, I can do it again and it\u2019s no big deal. Others say I shouldn\u2019t force myself into situations I\u2019m not comfortable with just to keep Aiden company.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to go to the casino again?",
