      "selftext": "My wife (31f) and I (32m) have three kids together so far. We have 5 year old twin boys and a 2.5 year old daughter. I grew up close to my family and loved them all and enjoyed their company but that has changed since becoming a dad, at least toward a lot of them. It started when our boys were born and my wife and I dressed them in some colors that my dad and some of my siblings considered not boy enough. If they had too many colors or too much light colors it was seen as being more girly. There was a huge deal made out of these rainbow outfits we got for the twins when they were a few months old. My oldest sister said they were making a huge deal out of it and told them the outfits were cute and why were they being so OTT about it. Mom didn't say anything against it but said nothing to stand with us either. I had already told my dad and the siblings complaining that I wasn't going to tolerate it.\n\nBy the time the twins were one we saw far less of my family except for my sister and her family and my mom if she came alone.\n\nThings didn't improve and got worse when our oldest son preferred baby dolls and toy kitchen stuff over \"boys toys\". If he was in a room full of \"boys toys\" he'd grab a stuffy and treat it like a baby. He gravitates to that kind of toy. But the way my dad reacted was insane. He actually yelled at me for getting my son a baby doll and all the accessories that came with it for Christmas. My mom didn't stand up for her grandson and it was after that we pulled way back from most of my family. The final straw was my dad was going to take toys off the oldest and \"make him play with the toys his brother has\". I was not about to let him bully my kid. Or any of my family.\n\nMinus my oldest sister. She's still awesome and all our kids love her and her family.\n\nI see my parents and other siblings around. We don't spend time together anymore but they have approached in public and my dad and a couple of the siblings have complained loudly that my son still has those toys and that he \"acts like a girl\".\n\nMy mom reached out and told me it hurt her that I cut her out too. That she never complained or said anything and I said her not saying anything in our defense hurt and I couldn't trust her to not try to bring dad in. I said he wasn't good for my kids to be around but especially the oldest. She told me it wasn't fair and the kids deserve to have family around them. She said my dad and most of my siblings might say things that hurt but they love the kids. I said not enough if they can't love and accept them for who they are. She told me I was wrong to punish them like this.\n\nAITA?",
