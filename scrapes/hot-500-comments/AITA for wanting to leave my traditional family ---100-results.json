      "selftext": "I have the option to move and be estranged now or move later and risk not getting to university \n\nJust looking for some advice  (warning i posted this on another sub reddit because it also felt relevant there)\n\nHi, I (17F)  am relatively new to this community and to reddit as a whole, and I'm not an adult just yet (will be in less than a months time) but I'm suffering with a dilemma and could use some advice.\nI have suffered a lot with very traditional religious parents who moved to a European country. I am not anything like either of my parents or the rest of my family and do not believe in religion or arranged/forced marriages as well as a lot of other stuff I was raised with. \nMy problem is my parents do not want me to go to university and want me to get married, which i absolutely refuse to do. They say that if I do wanna go or if they find out I've applied that I'll be kicked out and disowned. Similar concept for if they found out about my atheism or that I'm bisexual. I would be left homeless. My current place of education has offered to move me out into independent accommodation for my own safety should I choose to accept it. \nI really want to go, I'm tired of being locked in my room and not allowed to see or talk to friends. Or wear what I want, or go places outside of education and my mosque and I want to be given the option to work and go to a gym and have hobbies. I'm tired of ripping out my nails and skin and hair because of the constant anxiety. And not being able to have social media accounts and contact people outside of family. And I'm tired of making excuses for my parents being both physically and emotionally abusive my entire life. My father once smashed my phone with a hammer because I didn't do one piece of homework when I was like 14. But I also feel such guilt and heartbreak at never seeing my parents or older brothers again. I'm scared that what they say about me not being able to survive being independent and no one caring for and loving me the way they do is true and that I'll end up being miserable.  I know my actions will deeply hurt and impact my family and their reputations\nWould it be TA for leaving without warning?",
