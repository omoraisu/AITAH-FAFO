      "selftext": "Interested to bring this to the crowd\n\nFirst love many years ago, was totally head over heels. Dated her for six months and she dumped me. I was obviously devastated but said we could be friends. I\u2019d always been able to do that and I thought it would be okay. \n\nI didn\u2019t ever get a reason why, and it was all quite confusing at the time. She\u2019d told all her friends and me that I was the person she could see herself marrying/being with very long term.\n\nNevertheless, looking back I can now see the bad and not just the good. The fact she\u2019d constantly tell me about people asking her out on dates and to the gym etc (she was very pretty). I don\u2019t think she ever got the rise she wanted, my answer was always - \u201cI\u2019m not stopping you, but you know the outcome if you go\u201d. We also didn\u2019t have anything in common. \n\nThe next day after we finished, my friends and I were due to go out for drinks. I didn\u2019t know want to do anything but they were successful of coaxing me out of my room where I\u2019d spent the day depressed. Our circle of friends crossed over with my ex-gfs group and she turns up. I always thought that was super insensitive. I went upstairs back to my room and she left.\n\nThe same evening she messages me and tells me she loves me and wants to be back with me. I\u2019m naturally suspicious of this and ask all the necessary questions but she seems genuine. I go and see her in person and she tells me she wants a \u201ctrial\u201d period. My answer was an extremely emphatic no. We either go out or we don\u2019t. She wanted to go out, and I left. \n\nFor the proceeding couple of weeks, I\u2019m getting the cold shoulder and weird half-ass messages and time spent with her. I meet up with her to discuss it and she comes clean and tells me that she lied about wanting to go back out with me so that she could benefit from me having a big social group because she was not that sociable and in truth, not that well liked. I told her at this point, I wouldn\u2019t treat someone I hated in this way, and told her never to contact me again and I have never contacted her since. She told all her friends I\u2019d agreed to this trial period, I viewed it as mean. Not ego bruising, just standard mean. \n\nShe messaged me at Christmas. She messaged me at birthdays. I had her number blocked. I decided I could probably do the niceties and unblocked her when I was out on a night out. On that night out she sent me a tirade of mean messages saying I was telling people not to invite her to social events. I never did. This is the only time I spoke to her again of my own volition. I went to her house and told her to stop, and that I wouldn\u2019t ever speak to her. I never have. \n\nIn truth, it took me years to get over. Being young and in love is cool and sucks and I wouldn\u2019t change it. I don\u2019t blame her that much, I doubt she\u2019d do it again. Would love to know if people agree with me though, it was some top tier bellend behaviour. I don\u2019t think I was an asshole in completely ignoring her lol. My friends at the time thought it was a bit harsh but I presume that\u2019s an argument from convenience because of how the friendship groups crossed over. \n\n",
