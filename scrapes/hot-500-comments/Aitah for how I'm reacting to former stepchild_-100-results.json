      "selftext": "Some things altered for anonymity but tl;dr formerly friendly stepchild became hostile towards me after marriage leading me to divorce and has now apologzed for their behavior which I accept and am now ignoring and the people I trust in my life are making me question myself.\n\nI (36f/widow) had been in a relationship with my stbxh since 2019. I lost my first husband in 2012 to a drunk driver. My stbxh (40m) wasn't my first relationship after that loss but obviously we married so it had been the best. He is primary parent, his ex-wife (divorced since SC/17 was a toddler) had a custody plan but neither of them stuck to the schedule because they honored what SC wanted, which was mostly staying with dad. I was a friend to SC and we got along. SC would call me to chat, ask to go places with me and we even had harmless inside jokes (that I did always explain to my husband) and I was happy. The relationship cooled off as SC got older and grew more independent but still friendly and reliable. We got married in 2022 and I would say things changed dramatically then.\n\nI remember SC clinging to my husband and giving me the shortest answers possible. If I got up from the sofa beside husband, SC would take that spot. If I said hey I was sitting there, both dismissed me saying I could sit elsewhere no biggie. Then the complaints about my cooking when there weren't issues before and how their mom makes food, and it did lead to fights where husband would just get something ordered that SC likes. I did address these little things with my husband and he said to just leave it alone because SC is adjusting to such a life change. But I'd been living in his house since 2020, I'm not new. They escalated and soon SC said they didn't feel safe with how I drove and refused to get into the car if I was driving and my husband got frustrated at me. Inside jokes were gone and SC yelled that they don't keep secret from their dad. If I was so much as walked into the same room I'd get \"are you fucking serious?\" and such. But if I left the house sometimes SC would call my husband sobbing about being scared and alone in the house. I couldn't win. Then SC decided to live with their mom last year saying that they felt unsafe, unwanted and ignored. Not going to lie, I felt relief. But my husband came after me asking what did I do? I must have done something. How could I make SC feel that way? I tried talking to him, tried talking to SC, neither wanted therapy and when I got a phone call from his ex wife yelling at me that I'm a monster and she's taking my husband to court, I knew I had to go before something bad happened to me. I left months ago and filed for divorce which just pissed off the parents even more as if it was proof and was accused of running away.\n\nI very much regret selling my house. I'm currently in apartments that are nice but I'm not used to hearing stomps above my head. I got a text from former SC saying they're sorry they were mean to me. They had always hoped that their parents would get back together. Their friends hate their step parents and they were scared I was going to turn out bad too. They hate seeing their dad crying about another failed marriage. They're scared their dad isn't ok (I blocked him). I said that what they did was very hurtful, thanked them for recognizing their behavior and hoped them well in life. Then I blocked SC. I'm fucking done. A whole confusing year I endured something I didn't cause and was made to feel like it was my fault because no one except a child understood what was going on.\n\nI showed the texts to my friends and family who helped me during that time. I had been so damn scared that I was going to be arrested for something I never did and while I'm honestly angry at SC for everything they did, I can recognize they're a kid. One who knew better but I was in a scary position and I am angry. So I was at least very relieved to have proof. My mom said I should unblock SC and not punish them further because the guilt pushed them to reach out to me. My dad and siblings are on my side saying I don't owe them anything else. A few friends said I can't walk away from a hurting kid like that and SC was confused too. So I'm sitting here, again confused, and the only thing I can do is sit here confused. So impartial people please help.",

If the kid was that upset, they would\u2019ve went and lived with their mother sooner. They had that choice all along. That alone should\u2019ve made husband think twice. And when the kid finally did go to live with mom, the automatic response from dad was, what did you do? </p>\n\n<p>No, stbx killed your marriage. The kid was bad enough, but he damn well knew better that you weren\u2019t like that. Now you just found out that the kid deliberately destroyed your marriage over bs but <em>they are sorry</em>. No absolutely you are not required to maintain contact with that kid. </p>\n\n<p>All of a sudden, now that dad\u2018s crying and mom\u2018s not showing any signs of getting back with him (which was always the case) reality has \nset in. This is a life lesson for xsc, sometimes when you break something, it can\u2019t be fixed. Then you have to live with the consequences.</p>\n\n<p>You\u2019ve told whoever you wanted to know what happened. If anyone  brings it up or criticizes you tell them it\u2019s done and over with, drop it. Not only do you not owe your stbx or his child anything. You also don\u2019t owe anyone amongst your friends and family any further discussions or explanations about your decision.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019m sorry you had to go through this. Find yourself some peace and happiness, you deserve it.</p>\n</div>",
