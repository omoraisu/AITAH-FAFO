      "selftext": "Hello. I am so pissed off and my feeling are so hurt I don\u2019t even know what to do with myself right now. I wanted to add screenshots of some texts but this community doesn\u2019t allow that, but if you could please not accuse me of lying for no reason I\u2019d really appreciate it! \n\nMy best friend since fourth grade (\u201cAllison\u201d) called me last Monday in a panic telling me that she was going to be evicted from her apartment if she couldn\u2019t come up with the $200 she was short on rent for the month, as she was already a month behind so she asked to borrow it until she gets paid this past Friday. She said her landlords wouldn\u2019t wait til Fri, begged me for the money. \n\nI do not have money to lend. I\u2019m a single mom and I work as a bartender so I don\u2019t even live paycheck to paycheck, it\u2019s day to day for me & my 2 kids (8m & 6f). I know that Allison\u2019s rent problems are real, though, and I\u2019ve lost both of my parents, only child, so I\u2019m not exaggerating in saying that she\u2019s my only family. \n\nI had her come over and explained to her that I could let her borrow this money, but it\u2019s what I had saved up for my son\u2019s birthday party coming up this weekend and I NEED it back by this week to get his gift and everything ready for his party. Invitations are already out to kids at school, etc. \n\nSince his birthday is so close to Christmas, I always make sure to have some type of celebration because I remember kids growing up & stories from people I\u2019ve met whose birthdays were also close to Christmas saying how much they always hated it cause their birthday would get overshadowed. \n\nSo I explained all of this to her and she says she understands and how I should know she\u2019d never do anything to jeopardize the party, she\u2019s literally both of my kids\u2019 Godmother, etc. I know that you shouldn\u2019t lend out money that you can\u2019t afford to lose but I\u2019ve already explained how close we are, and I moronically went against this and gave her the money anyway. \n\nI\u2019m sure you can guess the rest. Friday has come and gone and she said that she had some bill autopay from her account that she\u2019d forgotten about and she just doesn\u2019t have the money to pay me back now. \n\nI\u2019m beyond devastated, like I haven\u2019t even told my son yet and I\u2019m starting to cry even thinking about how that\u2019s gonna go. But what has me pissed off now is how she\u2019s acting towards me, like annoyed that I\u2019m upset and I feel like she\u2019s minimizing how upsetting this is gonna be for my son. I understand that to her it\u2019s her rent vs a kid\u2019s birthday party, but my son isn\u2019t gonna see it that way and he shouldn\u2019t have to. I planned very carefully to be able to pull this party together for him and I explained all of that to her face to face and she swore that this exact thing would not happen. And *she\u2019s* annoyed somehow? I honestly feel like going no contact over this like that\u2019s how upset I am. But again, she\u2019s literally one of the only people I have in my life, so I don\u2019t wanna say something I\u2019ll regret. But AITAH here??",
