I haven\u2018t told him it makes me uncomfortable yet nor that I\u2019m ace because I really like him and I don\u2019t want him to break up with me because of this. \n\nI\u2019m debating at the moment whether to have sex with him to satisfy him and get him to stop asking or to tell him I\u2019m ace and risk him breaking up with me. He\u2019s been getting a little annoyed lately whenever I say no, so I feel like I have to make a decision soon.\n\nAnyways, I\u2019ve also posted this story on r/Asexual because it relates to that but, yeah, sorry if this turned into me rambling and if anyone has any thoughts, tell me about it.",
