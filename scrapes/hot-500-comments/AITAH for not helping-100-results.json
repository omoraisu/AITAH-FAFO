      "selftext": "I (16), is watching my neighbor (38), who i consider as a mother, being treated like shit by her bf. So just for info, I'm very close to my neighbor as she was my babysitter and i spend most of my time at her place. Ever since i was little, she always liked this guy, i don't know the details but i remember them always being on and off. She would often cry and be unhappy because of him. About 3 or 4 years ago, she built a house for them to start living together (he barely contributed to it). I don't know what happens behind closed doors but they would fight pretty often. It would result in her kicking him out and then they make up few days later. For info, this guy, he's so irresponsible like i don't get why she chose him, he acts like a child and he has bad drinking habits. I think it has been 20 years? since they knew each other, and she always wanted to get married but it  still never happened for some reasons, but who am i to judge. People that are very close to her have expressed their concerns of her being with him, and told her to break up with him so many times but she just won't do it.\n\nAnyways, today was her bday, and this mf didn't even get her a present instead he went to drink with his alcoholic friends first thing in the morning. She ended up really stressed, she had plans to go out during the day and everything was ruined. Later he came back and went to sleep, and he started to cry? because he wasn't feeling well he started punching the walls and tried to hit her. Even after all of that, (which btw it's not the first time he does something like that), she brings him to the hospital where he ends up starting a fight with a doctor. Her whole day was ruined. I feel so bad for her, she is working so hard and has lost so much weight trying to provide for a guy which in my opinion doesn't love her at all. She is the sweetest person ever and still she doesn't know what she's worth. She genuinely looks so happy when the guy shows her even an ounce of attention. I know that I shouldn't judge other people's relationships but this is so concerning, to see her cry so often just truly breaks my heart. I have tried talking to her but she just won't listen. I can't do anything but hope that she just realize her worth. I know that everyone is responsible for their own feelings and that she's an adult but i just feel so bad. How is it that the adults, her own family isn't seeing that this is so wrong why aren't they trying to help her out?? But i feel like I'm even worst that them, because I'm not doing anything I'm just hoping that the adults would magically do something. I know that I won't be able to talk sense into her but I just hope to make her happy by being next to her. I feel like she still sees me as this kid that she babysitted, but i wish she could just tell me when things get hard even if I can't do much. I feel like I'm not helping at all, i just don't know what to do but it feels so much like an excuse.",
