      "selftext": "Hello!!!\n\nSo my best friend (27F) is an amazing girl and I've always admired her but in this last relationship with her bf (29M) she did lots of things I just couldn't get over\n\nMostly her cheating \n\nShe slept with one of her bf's friends 3 times and she jokes about how the sex sucked. And to this day if she and the friend are alone he tries to fuck her and she plays it off\n\nShe also went on a trip and got fingered and gave the guy a bj, but she didn't consider that cheating till I brought it up\n\nThen recently she had a fight with her bf and that week she slept with someone at work and she's so excited to go back and see the work hookup.\n\nLike sure it shouldn't concern me but I just feel bad for the boyfriend. He's a nice guy just minding his business. But if I say something I might never be able to repair my relationship with my best friend. \n\nSo do I just turn a blind eye? ",
