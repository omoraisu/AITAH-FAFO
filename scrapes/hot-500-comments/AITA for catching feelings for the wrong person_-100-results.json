      "selftext": "I (18F) and my brother (19M) have always been extremely close and he would tell me anything and i\u2019d tell him anything, When we were 13yr and 12yr,  he came out to me as gay. I did not support it because our values and religious beliefs, that did lead me to telling our parents on accident once.  That did make our bond break and we stoped being as close as we were before.As we grew up, we all began to finally accept it and know he is still the same little boy as he was before. This lead to him introducing to his \u201cboyfriend\u201d( who i will call Joe), He was very attractive so I found it hard to believe he was gay, and at most would go for my brother instead of me (Only because he looked like the type to go for me). Joe later introduced me to the term \u201cBi\u201d, which means he liked males & females which did make me wonder if he would actually go for me if he was not with my brother. So I decided to text him asking about dinner plans with him and his \u201cboyfriend \u201c ( my brother) and that later led to us texting all day and all night which did excite me a bit but again he is my brothers \u201cboyfriend \u201c so I just let it go. But again, he kept texting me first and conversations kept  going on and on (which i did enjoy), and eventually i did end up catching strong feelings but i kept it to myself because again, he was with my brother who i wouldn\u2019t ever want to hurt. The day of the  dinner, he ended up sitting across from me and of course i got nervous and tried to dress a little more  special than i normally do. We end up making alot of eye contact. He was taller and stronger than anyone else there, so i asked him to help me set up the christmas lights outside because i needed a helping hand.  My brother offered to come and help too, but joe insisted that it should only be me and him and another person isn\u2019t needed at all. As we were setting up lights, we kept laughing and goofing around, and it turned to us getting really touchy and all of a sudden, Joe looks at me and HE made the first move. I was shocked at first but I gave in kissing him back. Luckily, nobody saw and we walked back into the house like normally. One kiss turned into daily secret hookups and i obviously felt very guilty , but again i cannot control how i feel and who i like. Me and joe started texting about how it would be better if we just were to date and tell my brother because keeping it a secret is cruel. A couple weeks pass, and Joe breaks up with my brother and i am the shoulder my brother cries on, Yes i felt bad but also i deserve to be just as happy as he was &  it wasn\u2019t that big of a deal because they had only been dating for a couple months. Some weeks past, I confessed to my brother I am the reason Joe broke up with him and we have been seeing eachother for a while ( i did not mention the first kiss). My brother went CRAZY, he started calling us names i don\u2019t want to repeat, saying we are \u201chorrible people\u201d. He yelled how he is ashamed he could ever trust me again and he regrets ever even getting close with me. He told my family members and they all saw me as a horrible sister, but they don\u2019t seem to understand you can\u2019t control who you like or who you are attracted too. AITA? ",

        "body": "Did Joe even really ask for your consent before kissing you? Like, do you feel like - and be honest! - you were flirting and touching and a kiss was fully expected and consensual for you? Just because you liked it doesn't mean it was really all that appropriate for him to just go for it without being more clear, even if he had been single. \n\nIt obviously is very significant that Joe did this with you WHILE with your brother. That's not ok for Joe to do. Do you think he won't also cheat on you? He was comfortable doing it to your brother with his sister at Christmas. Do you think it's really worth it to lose your brother over a guy who I can garantee you won't show you the respect everyone (generally speaking) should show their partner? \n\nYou also sound like you need to educate yourself a bit more on the LGBT+ community. Im glad you seem to have started getting over your homophobia but you're not where you need to be yet to have a legit good relationship with him. Like you have assumptions about if you can \"tell\" someone is gay, you didn't know people can be bi, you say \"boyfriend\" like it's less legit? I know part of that is the relationship was new, but yall are 18-19, a couple months still feels significant at that age. Can for older people sometimes too. \n\nI realize you're very young, and still learning and making mistakes, it's just that now is a good time to make an extra effort towards unlearning homophobia and becoming a good ally. \n\nIm also surprised you seem unaware that it is considered wrong to thirst after or get with your sibling's partner, or ex-partner, at least without a conversation FIRST.  You went behind his back for a significant time. That does break his trust.\n\nI know when you're young, attraction can feel so intense and letting it go can be so hard. But part of life is that sometimes you just can't be with every person you want to be with, even when it is mutual, at least not without potential consequences. \n\nTry putting yourself in his shoes. How would YOU feel? What would YOU want him and Joe to do towards you? \n\nidk if I wanna say y t a bc Im also leaning towards e s a. I don't think how your bro reacted is really acceptable, although I understand his hurt, and people do sometimes just lose it when they're that hurt.\n\nYou also did really hurt him in the past with your homophobia. I am a queer person and you may not realize how much it hurts and how much he's struggled. You not seeing his relationship as worthy of respect might just make him feel like you're still really homophobic, and most gay people don't want homophobes in our lives because it hurts very deeply. It's kinda like if you as a woman had a very sexist man in your life. Or if someone was constantly insulting your religion and extremely against your right to religious freedom. Or racist towards you. So his hurt is a lot bigger than just you. It's you, it's Joe, but it's also the world he lives in. \n\nHe needs and deserves your compassion. Apologize.\n\nAnd Joe? Doesn't deserve to be dating anyone right now until he can learn to be trustworthy and honest and not cheat in the worst possible way.",
