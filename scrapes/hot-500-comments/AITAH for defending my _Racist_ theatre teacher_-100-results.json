      "selftext": "Hi!! For context, I (17-year-old F) am a high school junior and am really into the theatre. My school is doing the musical \"Frozen,\" and I was auditioning for Anna this year. I recently had a falling out with a couple of my best friends and currently don't have many friends in my grade. I played on my school's volleyball team this fall, where I met Natalie. She is 18 (Senior) and also really into theatre. For context, she's Jamaican with black curly hair and brown eyes. I'm white with brown wavy hair and blue eyes, so I kinda look like Anna. I texted her about the play, and she said she was also auditioning for Anna as well. No big deal.\n\nAuditions were about 3 days ago, and the cast list was released around 12 hours later. I got Anna, and she got the mom and a townsfolk for musical numbers. She was pissed. She texted me, screaming that she should've gotten the part about how our director was racist for casting me instead of her and how we should riot. This came out of nowhere as she seemed awkward and sweet. I was also confused because the girl who got Elsa was Indian and looked nothing like the movie version of Elsa. I told her she might be upset but shouldn't jump to conclusions because our school was very serious about that. (One of the past teachers got fired for an accusation of discrimination. the kid who accused her confessed it was a joke, and she still didn't get hired back.) As soon as I said this, Nat started calling me racist, an asshole, and \"This is why you have no friends, loser\" I was upset by this, obviously. I told her to calm down, or I was gonna tell the theatre teacher what she was saying before she could make an accurate accusation; she didn't and sent me a video of her emailing the head of school. I met with the theatre teacher the next day and showed her the texts of her calling my teacher a racist. She immediately sent an email recasting her role and kicked her out of the program. She is sending me D3ath Th3eats in my locker, and I wonder if I did the right thing. So, AITAH?",
