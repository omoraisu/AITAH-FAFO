      "selftext": "Hey everyone, I wanted to give you an update after reading all the comments (thank you to everyone who gave advice, even the tough love).\n\nAfter reading all your comments and really thinking about it, I decided I needed to have a serious talk with my boyfriend about how I\u2019ve been feeling. I told him I was overwhelmed from doing almost all the cooking and housework on top of my freelance work, and that it wasn\u2019t fair for me to carry the bulk of everything just because I work from home.\n\nHe didn\u2019t take it well. He got defensive and said things like, \u201cYou\u2019re making a big deal out of nothing,\u201d and, \u201cI work harder, so it makes sense you\u2019d handle the rest.\u201d That really hurt because it made me realize he doesn\u2019t respect the work I do, whether it\u2019s my job or taking care of our apartment.\n\nI tried explaining that I didn\u2019t mind helping more but that I wasn\u2019t willing to keep doing everything. Instead of meeting me halfway, he doubled down, saying he shouldn\u2019t have to change anything because he\u2019s the one who \u201cpays more of the bills.\u201d That was the final straw for me.\n\nI realized I deserve a partner who sees us as equals and who\u2019s willing to put in the effort to make things fair. So, I ended things. It\u2019s been hard because two years is a long time, but I already feel lighter knowing I\u2019m no longer stuck in a relationship where my contributions aren\u2019t valued.\n\nThank you to everyone who gave me the push I needed to stand up for myself. I\u2019m sad, but I know this was the right choice for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",
