      "selftext": "I (30F) started working at a printing factory nearly 5 years ago. I started off as a 'helper' then slowly worked my way up into a Quality Auditor position on 3rd shift. I had never been happier. I loved what I did, working with books is my passion (slowly discovered this after struggling through art college and getting a useless degree in my area). I actually looked forward going into work, I volunteered for overtime often and took on extra projects without complaint. \nLast year the company sold, making it an 'employee owned' to a national printing franchise. They made major cuts quickly, over 60 people lost their jobs without notice, some there for over 35 years, many people jumped ship and found new jobs anyway.\nI was one of the lucky ones who made it through the cuts, two people in my department weren't so lucky. \n\nWe were told that the cuts were over and people were secure in their jobs. A year has passed since the cuts were made. They began rehiring people, filling in positions they deemed \"unnecessary\" at the time. Machine Operators were forced into helper roles. Getting paid 2x the amount of a regular helper for less work. \n\nAnyways, last Friday I got pulled into HR. They told me that after evaluation they deemed my position unnecessary. Quality runs on all shifts; It's not confined to 1st or 2nd only. \n\nAnd yet durring the quarterly meeting, they raved about how Quality is one of their main focuses for customers and they were 'excelling' at it?? \n\nTo say I was devastated was an understatement. I was ugly crying in front of the HR and Head Supervisor. They \"advocated\" for me to stay in the company, offering me machine operator positions for similar pay as to what I was making as an Auditor. They fed me the line of \"it's nothing personal, it's just business, but if they decide that 3rd shift is needed, you'llbe the first to know\".  \n\nWhich, in all fairness, I understand, but it also doesn't make sense. My job was more than pulling books and sending it out to customers. I pulled files, checked sections of books, put things on hold, brought problems to press and finishing. I took on the role of monitoring High security jobs/books with specific release dates, making spreadsheets and postings of said jobs for others to be informed. I was even in the process of learning how to make hand bound books so I could do MORE in the office, not just what the job description entailed. \n\nNow, I'm demoted to being a small Machine Operator, one that gets pulled from the machine to be a helper on other lines since they're still so short staffed. I basically lost my office job to go do grunt work. They also get mandated overtime, most often not to run machines but to work the lines as helpers, which I do NOT like at all. In a fit of anger, I applied to other jobs. Now, it's my first night back from being an Auditor to a machine operator (still need training). But I feel... guilty? That I want to leave. \n\nFive years of working a job I loved to repeat and have to start over. I swore I would to the bare minimum, just coast on by, head down until a better opportunity presented itself. I KNOW they'll still expect me to do Quality Auditor tasks, and my petty ass wants to respond \"that's not my job anymore, remember?\". \n\nI was loyal for those 5 years, advocating for the company when they hit hard times. But now? I couldn't care less. They made it clear that this is a job, one I'm easily replaceable at, not a life career like I hoped it could have been. My bf says they did me dirty and I should leave, but my loyal side hopes that it'll get better. \n\nShould I cut my losses and start over? Should I hang out and pray that they give me my position back after realizing Quality is nessessary on ALL shifts? I'm so torn. My pay is cut by $3, which doesn't seem like much, but it will effect my paycheck greatly in the future. ",
