      "selftext": "So I like to try food and drinks from around the world. One I tried is called Baikal. It's essentially a russian version of Coca-Cola. I've been ordering bottles for a while but since the war in Ukraine started It's been almost impossible to get a bottle here in the states. I was only able to get a small bottle recently from a guy who lives in Belarus. I admittedly payed way too much for it but i love the stuff and sometimes you just have to pay extra for what you like. I had it in the fridge and was going to enjoy it with dinner after work. When I got home I made a bowl of instant noodles and opened the fridge to grab my bottle of liquid heaven. It wasn't there. I figured maybe it got moved so I asked my girlfriend and she said she gave it to her little brother because he wanted something to drink and she couldn't find anything else. I was pretty angry so I just ate my ramen in silence and went to bed. Now my girlfriend is saying I'm being childish throwing a fit over a bottle of soda. So... am I the asshole?",
