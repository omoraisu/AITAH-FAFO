      "selftext": "My husband (32M) is upset that I didn\u2019t pick him up from the airport tonight. He\u2019s been away on a work trip for 8 days, and while I\u2019m happy he\u2019s coming home, these 8 days have been... challenging.\n\nWe have two kids (10 and 5), who I absolutely adore, but let\u2019s be honest they\u2019re energy bombs. On top of that, I work full-time in a stressful job that often requires overtime. During this week, their school was closed for two days, so I had to juggle being a full-time mom and employee simultaneously (I work from home).\n\nTo make things harder, we recently moved to a new town. We don\u2019t have family nearby, no trusted babysitter yet, and only a few new friends. So, yeah, these 8 days have been exhausting, but I managed.\n\nMy husband\u2019s original flight was supposed to land at 8 PM, and the airport is about 2 hours away one way. That\u2019s already a 4-hour round trip with the kids, which I wasn\u2019t thrilled about, but I was willing to do it. However, his flight got delayed, and instead of landing at 8 PM, it wasn\u2019t due to arrive until 11\u201311:30 PM.\n\nAt that point, I told him I wasn\u2019t comfortable driving that late with the kids (poorly lit highways and all). I suggested he either:\n\n1. Stay overnight at a hotel near the airport, and I could pick him up tomorrow after work (6\u20137 PM).\n2. Take a train the next day at 4 PM, which would get him into town by 5 PM, and I could pick him up (a short 10-minute drive).\n\nHe didn\u2019t take it well. I could tell he was annoyed short replies, ignoring my texts, and just the overall vibe of someone upset but not saying it directly. Now, I\u2019m feeling a little guilty. Maybe I should\u2019ve just gone to get him? But I also feel bad for the kids and honestly a bit for myself too.\n\nSo, Reddit, WIBTA for sticking to my decision? Or should I have just sucked it up and driven out to get him?\n\n**TL;DR:** Husband (32M) upset I didn\u2019t pick him up from the airport after his flight got delayed to 11:30 PM. I\u2019ve been solo parenting two kids (10 and 5) for 8 days while working a stressful full-time job. Suggested he stay in a hotel or take a train the next day because the 4-hour late-night drive wasn\u2019t ideal. He\u2019s annoyed, and now I feel guilty. AITA?",
