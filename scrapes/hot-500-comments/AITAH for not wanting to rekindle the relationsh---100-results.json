      "selftext": "I (35F) and my child's father (36M) has been together since he came home from being away in 2021 . He has a child from a previous relationship (5F) . Our relationship was NOT the best In 2023 I Found out he was cheating ( with someone ( lets call her Mia ) when I was 8 months pregnant with our now (2 Yr old daughter ) ,I stayed of course because this was my first child and I wanted a family .... Fast forward to me giving birth to our child unbeknowing to be he was still cheating with Mia . I still stayed and over the months it got no better .. Fast forward to February 2024 we broke up because I was no longer happy , we got into a huge fight it was as bad as he outed me being S/A on the internet & putting my child into harms way .. that was my last straw . he went almost 1 month without seeing her as i'm her primary parent & didn't feel obligated to let him see her . So may 2024 I found out he had been back talking to Mia & he had our daughter around her WITHOUT me knowing ..I Started back talking to him for a constant babysitter while I work .. weeks later I Found out via Mia , Not only did he have my daughter around her but they are expecting a child together ... & I was FURIOUS , because I put my all into him and helped build him up to get nothing in return BUT my beautiful daughter .... Mia has said F\\*\\*\\* my daughter on multiple occasions when I found out About her in 2022 to my child's father so for you to have  our child around her is ABSUARD !!!! , NOW the baby part? I was BROKEN I just didn't understand and due to the fact I had a miscarriage in July 2023 and it broke me . and fast forward to now he tries to gaslight me into thinking I'm wrong for not wanting to be with him since he has a baby on the way and he doesn't respect me . I know I'm NOT wrong for standing up for my feelings and knowing my worth I just want other opinions. since I left him alone my life has honestly ELEVATED Its much more peaceful without all the UNCESSASSARY DRAMA ",
