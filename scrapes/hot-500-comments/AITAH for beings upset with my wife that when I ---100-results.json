      "selftext": "My wife (31F) and I (33M) have been married for just over a year, and lately, I've been noticing something that's increasingly bothering me. It's making me want to become more emotionally reserved, though that's not what I truly want.\n\nThe issue revolves around physical affection, particularly cuddling. Whenever my wife wants to cuddle on the couch or be held, she expects me to drop everything immediately. It doesn't matter if our kids are running around screaming, if I've just returned from work exhausted, or if I'm in the middle of tasks for our joint side business. Even when I'm organizing the garage or basement, I'm expected to stop what I'm doing.\n\nIf I say something like, \"Just a second, let me finish this first\" or \"I'm in the middle of something I really want to complete,\" she becomes visibly upset and pouty. This behavior often makes me feel guilty, and I end up giving in and cuddling with her.\n\nHowever, the double standard is what truly frustrates me. When I want to cuddle and she's busy with her own activities\u2014whether it's cleaning or working on her schoolwork\u2014she often declines, saying she's \"on a roll.\" This has reached a point where I've started deliberately avoiding her or finding other things to do because I'm so angry about the situation. I feel like my physical needs aren't as important as hers, and that she only wants to give me physical attention when it's convenient for her, while expecting me to make her needs my top priority regardless of circumstances.\n\nI find myself wanting to refuse her requests for cuddles the next time she asks, but I know I'll probably give in because the guilt is overwhelming. I also find myself purposely disappearing when she declines my requests for physical affection. Am I wrong for feeling this way and reacting like this?\n\nUPDATE:\n\nI want to thank everyone for their responses. After taking your advice, my wife and I had a conversation today that revealed some additional concerns about imbalances in our relationship that she hadn't previously recognized. We were both able to better understand each other's perspectives.\n\nHowever, I'm still feeling uncomfortable with some aspects of the situation. Now when we spend time together, she makes comments like, \"I don't want you to feel guilted into hanging out with us because I don't want to hear about how I did that later.\" The passive-aggressive tone of these statements doesn't sit well with me.\n\nThere's also an important context I should have mentioned earlier: I spent seven years in an extremely abusive relationship before my current marriage. My ex-partner's abuse was severe \u2013 I wasn't allowed to sleep in our bed or sit on the couch, and she even forced me to either walk half a mile to a gas station or defecate outside. Throughout that relationship, I was constantly trying to keep her happy at the expense of my own well-being.\n\nI'm realizing now that this traumatic past relationship is likely contributing to my sensitivity about the current situation. After spending years trying to please someone who was never satisfied, I'm particularly attuned to situations where I feel my needs are being dismissed or where I'm being manipulated through guilt.\n\nThis background helps explain why the current dynamic with my wife triggers such strong emotions in me, even though the situations are very different. My past experiences have made me especially sensitive to feeling pressured or guilty about meeting someone else's needs while having my own needs dismissed.",
