      "selftext": "Turns out when you threaten to go no contact and follow through, tunes change. SIL can't contact us due to a restraining order, so she tried to lean on other members of the family. No one really buckled under that pressure aside from a stray mishap here or there, but we would be quick to block. \n\nDean has been very protective since everything happened and we've since moved, and yes we brought the skeletons and we have more now. \n\nIt was fine all until SMIL contacted me directly asking me not to talk to Dean yet, but she is worried this has gone on too long. SIL had thought herself pregnant back in July but it turned out not to be the case. But since then she has been insistent she is having a baby with SMIL and some other members of the family. Dean and I were not aware of this.\n\nSIL then, according to SMIL, accidentally called Dean her son in front of the extended family after we moved. This has put it in her head that this might be possible. \n\nI don't know quite what to do, I ha ent told Dean about this yet because it's ridiculous and sounds too much like a soap opera or something. And he's finally in a good place in staying ko contact. We are closer to my \"family\" (not related but the closest I've got to family really) and we've had a full social calendar since we've moved. \n\nI told a friend about this and she says I have to talk to Dean about this so he's not blindsided later and I would normally agree but I hate that this woman has been on our minds so much of the time all the time and don't want her to continue to ruin what we have. I'm going myself the weekend to figure out if I will tell him or not, in the meantime I got him a new Skelton name Manfred from his favorite video game hopefully to keep things light. \n\n",
