      "selftext": "my stb-ex and i have been separated for just over a month, I'm still very much in my head that i'm still married but I'm trying to kinda move on.\n\nwell this guy came into my job, i was the person at the desk at the moment and he started asking me about the tattoos he could see on my wrists and hands. he asked if we could keep talking on my lunch break because he had to go fix something.\n\ni honestly thought he had left because I left the front and was helping someone else but when i went on lunch he walked up with his own lunch and sat across from me. we were talking my entire lunch break. i was flirting, the guy gave me his number but once he was gone i felt like i was the worst person in the world.\n\ni spent the rest of the day nearly having a panic attack thinking my husband was gonna find out even though realistically i know that he wont....not even remotely interested in dating at the moment but it was kinda nice having someone talk to me about shit i like instead of catering to the every mood swing of my stb-ex.\n\nAITAH?",
