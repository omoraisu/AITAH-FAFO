      "selftext": "I will add TW Abuse\n\nTo explain our situation: a year ago I gave birth to a beautiful baby. Ensued deep postpartum depression on my part. My husband is epileptic and had multiple seizures and panic attacks in that period of time. It was an extremely difficult period of our lives and still is in some ways. Some people helped and some others make it worse just by their presence; sadly, the great grandma is the later for us.\n\nShe lives on the same street as us. She tries to create relationships by buying stuff to people and then expecting them to do what she wants in return. She was abusive and dismissive of my husband when he was a child, eg. slapping him in the face, hitting him and saying \u00ab\u00a0why are you making me do this?\u00a0\u00bb. At one point he was living with her as an adult and he had a seizure after an argument and she said he was just having a fit. She as an estranged child and a lot of her own family members do not want contact with her. \n\nAfter I gave birth and I visited her with the baby, one of the first thing she told me was that I should work out to lose the baby weight. She said some weird stuff like she wanted to have my baby in her own belly and didn\u2019t want to give her back to us. She never asks questions to get to know you, she is always the victim, but also she is super generous with money and objects so in the outside she looks like a good hearted lady. That\u2019s the thing; we \u00ab\u00a0owe\u00a0\u00bb her a lot. There are a lot that I could add. \n\nSince that last visit in April, she hasn\u2019t seen me or my baby. It was hard for me to get out and she stressed me out. Also we spent the Summer in the country side. My husband is just starting to get better. We did see other family members and friends; it\u2019s simple the situation with her is weird. She never yelled at me personally but I know she used to trash talk me when I was dating my now husband. I guess she loves me and then hated me? \n\nAnyway I told myself it would be time to go visit, because I do feel guilty about it. But my husband basically had a panic attack at the idea of seeing her so I cancelled and now she is not answering my text. I feel like I\u2019m a bad person, because she is old and kind of lonely. \n\nSo am I the asshole?",
