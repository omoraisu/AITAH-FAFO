      "selftext": "Okay for context i was an addicted to f3nt for like two years and today I am two years sober. I\u2019m not gonna lie I felt like it was a big day or an accomplishment for me. I had kinda brought it up days before and I was excited. By no means did I want him to buy me a gift or send me a big paragraph on how good im doing, ANYTHING!! but this morning I said \u201cguess what?\u201d And he said \u201cwhat\u201d. \u201cToday is my two years baby!\u201d And the response I got was \u201chell yeah\u201d which kinda felt like a stab to the chest. Later in the day I told him hey it\u2019s a big deal for me and I just want you to understand that. And his response was \u201cwe all go through shit and really you\u2019re the one that did that to yourself\u201d (I paraphrased that it was more like a paragraph of how it was my fault) but at that point im in tears bc now im rethinking my whole situation bc ik it\u2019s my fault but i just feel stupid now for making a big deal abt this day bc i mean it is just another day but i just thought it was a little bit more important to me.. idk i could be tripping but pls lmk what yall thing bc im 100% okay with being the asshole in this case.",
