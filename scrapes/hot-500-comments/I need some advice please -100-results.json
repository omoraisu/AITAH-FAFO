      "selftext": "Help\n\nI(24f) love my boyfriend(25m) with my whole heart and I am the type to bottle things up instead of communicating, because I\u2019m autistic. I was diagnosed at 20 because I grew up in a \u201cpray about it\u201d house. This man is very patient, kind, and has a heart of gold. He\u2019s a hard worker and a good provider. But, when he\u2019s home, all he wants is to play video games. He hates to help me clean and always asks me to cook. I love cooking for him and baking for him, but not every single day. He was raised in a house where the women did everything. So was I, but that was if the woman stayed home. We both work full time, but he gets paid more, so in his mind, he does more work. I don\u2019t mind doing the cleaning and cooking, but that means I should be getting more than 20 minutes of his attention everyday. He will come straight home and go straight to the computer and play for hours to \u201cdecompress\u201d, and I\u2019d understand if it was an hour or so and the rest of the time was spent with me. I go to bed early because I\u2019m up at like 3:30-4 for work. He knows all of this and sometimes tries, but he\u2019d always rather be playing games. We are a pretty open minded couple sexually, (we both watch porn), and I usually don\u2019t have issues with it. I am the jealous type and I do get insecure, especially when he\u2019s searching up and watching specific pornstars. I\u2019m sure it\u2019s a me problem, but it hurts my feelings when he does it the morning after we\u2019ve had sex and I\u2019m at work. It makes me feel like I\u2019m not enough for him. There is so much more I could add for more context or whatever, but I\u2019m gonna end here for now. 24 F, 25 M. Been together for 2 years \nWhat do I do? How do I even approach this situation? ",
