      "selftext": "i (f19) recently got called out by my girlfriend (f18) for playing the game Love and Deepspace. A GACHA game where there are 4 male love interests, you can battle and play stories with them to learn their lore. this wasnt something that i hid from her, i actually told her about it many times as i have spent a lot of money on merch and go to lots of social events regarding the game. i understand that its probably a little weird to be playing romance games whilst in a relationship, but i didnt think too much of it as ive always played this type of game especially as a young teenager. now as i said, i attend a lot of events regarding the game. and recently i made a friend group at a cosplay convention, which is also a hobby that i have always enjoyed. this was my first time making friends at a convention, so i was really happy about finally having a sense of community and when telling my girlfriend everything she all the sudden got really closed off and i could tell something was bothering her. after a little while of refusing to speak, she eventually told me that she doesnt like me making friends. and that she cant help but hate anyone who enters my life in fear that that they will get in the way of our future together. she said she doesnt mind me having friends as long as i dont talk about it and promise they are only temporary until we move in together, because she doesnt want them in our household. she was very apologetic whilst saying all these things, so naturally i was comforting her whilst still trying to understand her point of view. i did end up promising her that they will only be temporary, and that to me she is the only permanent person in my life. \n\nnow fast foward a few days, i post my photoshoto photos from the convention. i was cosplaying one or the male love interests, so she got curious and decided to finally search the game. this is when she found out that it was a dating simulator, she took it to heart and honestly i cant really blame her for it. the term dating simulator does seem way more extreme as to what the game actually consists of, thres a lot of lore, battling, card collecting, and minigames, whilst also being able to boost your relationship stats with the characters. i did explain everything to her, but she is still uncomfortable with me playing it. i never actively hid this from her so i had hoped she wouldnt be too upset about it,  but she is a very jealous and possessive person in general, and typically doesnt like me having feiends or interactions with others. \n\ni have since apologised several times, given explanations, even let her play the game and show her everything, but she still wants it gone. now i have been playing this game since the release, and have spent hundreds on it. because hey i have adult money now, why not indulge in something i enjoy? so its pretty sad to have to let go of a hobby that has given me a community \n\n\nAITA?",
