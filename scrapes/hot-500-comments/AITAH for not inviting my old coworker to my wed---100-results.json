      "selftext": "My old coworker (let\u2019s call her \u201cA\u201d) invited me literally the day before to her wedding. I assumed it was because someone backed out last minute and she wanted to fill the seat up. I was free so I decided to go to A\u2019s wedding. It was weird because while I was on the dance floor, our other coworker \u201cB\u201d (who A is bffs with) threw it in my face that I was really only invited because someone had backed out. Now I already knew this but it felt so bitchy to say that in front of my face. Anyway, fast forward to today, A texts me \u201chow\u2019s wedding planning going?\u201d I feel like A is expecting to go to my wedding but I really didn\u2019t plan on inviting her. AITAH if I don\u2019t invite her to my wedding when she invited me last minute to hers?",
