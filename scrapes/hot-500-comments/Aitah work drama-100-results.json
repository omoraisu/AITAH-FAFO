      "selftext": "I work at a small food and beverage venue. After the owner, I am second in command. One manager, and then me. The manager (Greg) has started sleeping with and dating a lower level employee (Alisha). \n\nAlisha is a day dreamer, gets tired on the job easily, and even after working there for a few months, needs guidance on alot of tasks and often makes mistakes if not supervised. \n\nEven the owner has mentioned to me that they feel Alisha has the skill level of a junior worker.\n\nAnyway, the owner has been away lately, and the manager has been in charge. \n\nI am often pushing Alisha to get tasks done because if they are not done in time, she has to stay later than the allotted time, or someone else will complete them. \n\nOne day in particular, I didn't have alot of patience left for her as from the beginning of the shift she didn't know what tasks to complete or what to do. She has done that same shift  multiple times so I expected by now she would have at least some idea.\n\nIt really bothers me because she has a simple job, however, still makes mistakes (though she has been explained and done everything multiple times), takes up a lot of space (like standing in the way and taking a long time to move out), and takes a long time to do all the tasks. \n\nKeep In mind I am happy for both Greg and Alisha to be dating. I am friends with each of them outside of work. However, I am annoyed because I feel like Greg isn't pushing Alisha to work very hard at all and dismisses the stupid things that she does solely because they're an item. \n\nAnyway the other day she told me she didn't like the way I speak to her at work, and that it felt very condisending. \n\nTo be honest she is right I was condisending, and I do feel bad that I have upset her. \n\nI responded to her and apologised sincerely, but I dread working with her as I find she creates more work than help.\n\nI really feel she lacks a good work ethic, it doesn't seem like she pushes herself and I don't want her to think she can continue doing all of her tasks slowly and flirting in the middle of work just because she is in a relationship to the manager. \n\nIt's quite frustrating. \n\n I try to keep it to myself as they are friends of mine, but I find it very annoying when they flirt and get close at work. \n1. Everything at work should be kept professional \n2. Because she doesn't seem to push herself at all, but then has time for flirting??\n3. Because it's cringe worthy. She is clearly emotionally attached, he is a caring type, however I suspect he is in it for the sex and temporary companionship more than anything. (I am speculating of course but it makes me feel bad for her, and makes me think she is naive) \n\nI wish I didn't speak so condisendingly to her because I realised now she is a  really sensitive person. \n\nBut I can't get rid of this feeling of, if you can't do your job properly, and you can't handle the real world, where people will sometimes speak to you condisendingly, then thats your problem, you can't expect everyone to tiptoe around you, thats not how the world works.\n(I'm not saying the way I spoke was warranted here but it is a common occurrence, in life, and the industry) \n\nI could tell I had upset her because I asked her to do a few things and she would just pretend to not hear me. This sort of attitude just adds to my annoyance. I get it that her anxious personality may be holding her back and maybe I am being harsh but that's something she needs to work through. \n\nAITAH for pushing her too hard and expecting more? \n\nI also don't feel like I can speak honestly with the manager about it, because they are in a relationship. \n\nSo I'm not really sure where to go from here, I apologised and I'm going to be really careful with how I speak to her as I really do not want to upset her again. However, I am still frustrated by the things I have mentioned above and I don't want to accept them because I simply don't think it is helpful or fair to the rest of the team.\n ",
