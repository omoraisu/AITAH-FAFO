      "selftext": "This happened to us while flying to France out of Raleigh. My husband and I had booked our aisle and middle seats together. While boarding my husband got up to use the bathroom before the pre-flight announcements. As we double-checked our seat location, there was a woman already sitting in the window seat of our row with a baby. As soon as I put my purse in my seat to take off my sweater and settle in, her husband, came over to sit in my husband\u2019s seat. He looked at me and said \u201cOh, I need to sit next to my wife and baby.\u201d I responded, without moving out of his way, that it was my husband\u2019s seat; and he was in the bathroom. He said, \u201cWould he mind sitting in my seat?\u201d, and proceeds to point all the way towards the back of the plane. \n\nI immediately responded \u201cI can speak on behalf of my husband and that would be \u2018No\u2019.\u201d They both looked at me with confused looks on their faces like I somehow didn\u2019t have a right to politely decline. Then they tried to get the flight attendant\u2019s attention, but as they did that the person sitting directly behind the woman with the baby lifted herself up from her seat and said *\u201dIf you knew you were flying with a baby, you should have made sure your seats were booked together.\u201d*\nThey both looked at each other, then at the lady behind us, and blankly looked at me, while they mumbled something about trying to do just that, but couldn\u2019t for whatever reason. By then my husband was back and hers had already walked away. My husband sat down and I quietly told him was had just occurred (in case her husband might come back and ask him himself, or bring the flight attendant over) and he was glad I didn\u2019t let his seat go. With it being a long flight and him having anxiety about flying, he definitely didn\u2019t want to be sent to the back of the plane alone, and I definitely didn\u2019t want to be alone sitting next to a couple with a small baby for hours across the Atlantic. But I was even more appreciative of the woman behind us who spoke up, just because.\n\nSafe travels everyone. \n\n*Edited for grammar.  ",

I didn't know the woman next to me, but we both smiled and discussed how we both got lucky to get these seats.\n\nA few minutes later, I saw a flight attendant walking up the aisle and looking at each passenger. Her eyes eventually locked on mine and she approached me and said that I was being upgraded to first class. I was speechless and the woman next to me just said something like, wow you really scored even more!\n\nI said yes thinking I'd be in business class. She (FA) walked me forward past all the business class people and all the way to the front of the plane, to the actual first class that is better than business class. The FA up there asked if I was just upgraded from business class and I said no, coach. She looked surprised and said she needed to know my name and I told her. She put me in an aisle seat (in row 1) and asked what I wanted for breakfast and there were all sorts of choices including an omelet they would make up custom for you -- any way you wanted it. It was ready in 5 minutes, before the plane even took off. There were all sorts of perks like that during the flight.\n\nOver the course of the flight I eventually figured out what I think happened. The flight was full. The man I was seated next to was a frequent flyer and acted rather condescendingly to the Flight Attendants (who were all women) and also behaved in a pretty sexist manner toward them. They had kept the seat next to him empty and it seemed like they often did that for him, but couldn't once the flight was full. I had also noticed the last person boarding the plane a long time after everyone else was a woman and I glanced back and it looked like they were directing her to my former seat in the emergency row in coach. All I can figure is that they didn't want to seat a woman next to my new row-mate -- probably for her own good. The man was polite with me and there were no issues. But it was a trip to see the way he treated the flight attendants. He acted like he owned the airline!\n\nThe only question that I never figured out is why they didn't upgrade someone from business class instead of me. Not that I minded at all!

            "body": "My dad had season tickets for the Cleveland Browns for 25 years. Some radio a station had the two tickets on each side of us, and would give them away as a foursome every week. So 4 people would show up, and find us sitting in our two seets in the middle of theirs. Of course, they ALWAYS asked us to move, and my Dad ALWAYS said No, and his go-to excuse was that these seats were his Good Luck Seats, and he couldn't sit somewhere else, or the Browns would lose. They usually lost anyway, but by then the game was over, and we'd alrwady sat in our seats. \n\nThe thing was, the old Municipal.Stadium had poles everywhere, which usually partially blocked the view, no matter where you sat. But my Dad had carefully chosen seats where one pole went right down the goal line, and another cut off the rear corner of the end zone. That was about as close to an unobstructed view as you could get. But if we move into either of the seats on each side of us, we would have poles blocking important viewing zones, like the area within 5 yards of the goal line. My Dad said that he didn't go to all that trouble to pick as good a seat as you could get in that stadium, just to gift them to strangers every single week, so he could sit in substandard seats. Even as a kid, I thought that made perfect sense. He didn't want to explain it every time, though, so he usually just said \"Those are our seats. Move. Now.\" He didn't yell, but you could tell he wasn't kidding, and that he was immovable. If they questioned him, he would give them the Good Luck Seats line, and tell them again to leave. They always did, we never had to get an usher. \n\nOnce, my Dad took my brother, who was very shy and non-confrontational. My brother headed up to the seats while my Dad went to the rest room and bought a beer. As my Dad  was heading up the steps with his beer, he spotted my brother sitting on the steps at the end of our row. My brother just pointed, and there were four nuns sitting in our seats. My Dad didn't hesitate, and said to the nuns, \"Those are our seats, you'll have to move.\" He assumed they were from the seats on each side of us, but he was wrong. They were from an entirely different part of the stadium, and said \"You can sit in our seats over there. We couldn't see well from there, so we took these,\" as if that was a normal explanation. NOBODY else would think they could get away with that, but these were some entitled nuns.\n\nSo my Dad said \"Why would I trade my good seats for terrible ones? I want to sit in my seats.\" They started to argue back, and my Dad just interrupted them, and said \"Sisters, I'm not Catholic, so that's not going to work. Get out of my seats, or I'm getting the authorities.\" And they moved, grumbling the entire time. My normally quiet brother couldn't wait to come home and relate the story. Its one of the proudest moments I remember about my Dad, and a life lesson - Don't let ANYBODY take your shit, not even Nuns.",

By what appeared to be a couple on their honey money(which we learned during the arguments was true). So I had to sit beside my ex gf, whom had to sit by the window. She's a terrible flyer and claustrophobic, so she needed the window. Well when we got up to our seats this lady is sitting there giggling with her new husband, we ask them to move out of our seats please. She looks at us angry as can be and says \"We got here first and it's my honeymoon. Sit over there. (Pointing to the aisle seats in our row) Tell her that's not how this works and we paid for these 3 seats, were sitting in those 3 seats and kindly again asked her to move her things and out of the seats. She now is getting audible, drawing attention and acting like we're the bad guys ruining her honeymoon. \"You people are so rude trying to destroy my perfect honeymoon. Just sit over there like you're supposed to.\" I politely say we're trying to sit where we are supposed to, in the seats we paid for. At this point attention is being brought to us, and given my ex has terrible anxiety she's trying to tell me it's okay she'll be fine (I know she won't). Eventually a flight attendant comes over asking us to take our seats, before I can even say anything Mrs honeymoon spouts out \"see I told you. Take those seats\". I kindly show our boarding passes and point out to the attendant whom begins moving closer to Mrs Honeymoon. And this is where shit hit the fan. Attendant asks to see their boarding passes. They weren't even in the aisle seats in our row they were near the back of the plane where there is no windows. And she thought this was ruining her honeymoon and decided to just wait a few moments after boarding and take the first window seat she sees and just request the original owner take hers and her husband's. We decline this offer. Flight attendant asks her to move to their original seats as we've declined the move. She's yelling obscenities now, exclaiming we are ruining her honeymoon and that \"my daddy owns so and so and when they hear about this you're all fucked\" \n\nThere is now 6 flight attendants around us asking her to leave the section and return to her seats. She's now pretending to be hyperventilating and claiming I struck her earlier. She's crying her husband is now arguing with us. And then the best part. I grab their baggage from the overhead, place it nicely on the seats beside them and start putting ours away. And get this, husband guy punches me. And 2 us air marshals were on the flight and witnessed the assault and escorted them both off the plane. I was asked if I wanted to press charges, said no, her \"perfect honeymoon\" being \"ruined\" was enough for me. \n\nSo we get our seats and the elderly couple sitting behind us make conversation, turns out the couple also tried to steal their seats too but grandpa somehow convinced them to move after talking to the husband. \n\nSo that makes me wonder what Gramps said to make them move...",
