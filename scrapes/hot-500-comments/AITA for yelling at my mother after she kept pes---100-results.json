      "selftext": "For context, I (M26) and my girlfriend of six years (F27) are staunchly child-free. We're each our own kind of Autistic and neither of us want children because of how neurotic we can be at times. We do quite well for ourselves and have plenty of disposable incomes because we kick-started our careers early and saved early on (I'm a journeyman electrician and in the process of getting my electrical engineering degree, and my girlfriend is on her way to becoming a nurse practitioner.) We're both super busy as you can imagine, with both work and school and such, and it can get rough at times but we manage. \n\nMy father passed away a year ago, and it sent shockwaves throughout our small family, and now my mother moved in with us after selling her house because she was getting too old to live on her own (she had me at thirty four and she lived out in the country, so it wasn't the safest for her.) She cooks and cleans while we work, buys the groceries with her SS, and generally tries to make herself useful even though we tell her it isn't necessary. We appreciate her efforts due to how busy we are (our diets absolutely have improved lol) but we're worried because doesn't have a lot of hobbies and oftentimes doesn't know what to do with herself, I'm not sure why she hasn't looked for any hobbies, but that's her choice I suppose. \n\nI'm her only child, and recently (over the past few months) she's started to pester the both of us about giving her grandchildren she can spoil. At first I made a joke about our cat being her grandchild, and she thought it was funny but didn't stop. I figured it was just a phase and that she'd move on, but she didn't. Every day she just kept making these little comments about grandchildren and that our kids would be adorable. It was easy to ignore at first, but she wouldn't stop. \n\nThen one day I had a hard week at work and didn't get enough sleep at all, and while she was making breakfast the next morning she kept bringing it up and kept trying to make it into a serious conversation, talking about how a grandchild would make her so happy. I finally snapped and told her to let it go and I got loud (nothing serious, but I did tell her she was unbearable when all she thought about was grandchildren and I couldn't understand why she couldn't just get the fuck over the fact that me and my SO were Child-free and happy.) She continued the rest of the meal in silence, and proceeded to give me the cold shoulder for the rest of the day. \n\nThat was several weeks ago. She's like a completely different person now. She still cooks and cleans and stuff, but she barely talks at all, and when there's nothing to do she just sits on the couch and rots away, eyes glazed over as she watches family feud, antique roadshow, and whatever else old people watch. She never wants to go anywhere or do anything, especially not with us. Whenever I try to have a conversation with her that's more than discussing a basic necessity she just gives me a dirty, bitter look and I usually back off. She just dies whatever chores she sets out to do that day (we don't require anything from her, this is all out of her own volition) and then just watches TV (watching is a strong word, more like she just sits there and just... rots. I can't think of a better word for it.) \n\nSo recently me and my girlfriend were talking and we found a great deal on a cruise and decided to go since we had amassed a lot of PTO. We bought the tickets and surprisedbher with one, thinking a cruise from Budapest to Amsterdam would cheer her up. She just glowered at the tickets like I had handed her a bag of dog shit as a birthday gift and then asked me what it was for. I told her that we wanted to go on a cruise with her to maybe cheer her up and help her get out of the house. \n\nHer response? _\"Why did you start to pretend that you care about my happiness all of a sudden? I want nothing to do with this, go refund it.\"_\n\nI felt so dirty when she said that, like I couldn't even be in the same room as her, and I left the house entirely for a few hours to go get some fresh winter air, and even now I'm still processing what the hell is going on. My mother is like a completely different person now and I don't know if it's my fault or not. AITAH? Did I cause this? ",

Apologize for raising your voice, but tell her you find it intrusive that she&#39;s pushing for you to have kids when it is NOT her decision to make.</p>\n\n<p>Encourage her to join a class or try a hobby. Maybe get her into counseling.</p>\n\n<p>My child and IL decided not to have kids. I&#39;ll never be a grandmother, but I&#39;ve never pestered them about it. It&#39;s their choice. In fact, I&#39;m at the point where it&#39;s a relief. I&#39;m too old to be chasing toddlers around, trying to keep them from getting hurt. The world isn&#39;t safe for children, either, and I don&#39;t have to worry about any little people.</p>\n\n<p>But even back when I longed to grandchildren, I didn&#39;t question their decision. Only the two people involved get to make the decision, and I&#39;ve known someone who had kids just to make granny and grandpa happy, but they weren&#39;t were good parents and seemed to resnt their children. Their kids weren&#39;t very happy, either.</p>\n</div>",
