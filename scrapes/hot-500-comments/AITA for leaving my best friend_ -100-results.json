      "selftext": "I (18F) and my best friend (18F) let's call her Tina . We have known each other for 2 years and became close by the end of 2023. She had a group of best friends (group of 4 including herself) who threw her out of the group because she stopped wearing the friendship bracelet given by her then best friend. Me and her knew each other back then and once this issue came up, she wanted to stay with me and my best friend, (18F) Vivian. Me and Vivian were more than happy to have Tina with us, because she genuinely seemed like she needed someone to talk to. We were there for her all the time. \n\nSoon, 2024 came up and we were busy with our semsters, Tina grew comfortable with us and we became a trio. But, she always had a problem with Vivian, Vivian and her never saw eye to eye and I was kind of torn in between them, because most of the time when they fight, I would sort it out but deep down I always felt like Vivian's point of view made a lot more sense than Tina's. But I never told it out loud to any of them. Time went by and there was a time where Vivian made a mistake and Tina took this as an opportunity to bash her, it caused everyone a huge mental stress and soon it resulted to Vivian cursing both of us out and wanted to stay away from Tina. Tina pretty much took charge of the issue and it resulted in us breaking the friendship with Vivian, that was my mistake. I should have never done that, but at the time, both me and Tina were stuck in a turmoil because of something Vivian had done, which I know she didn't mean to eventually but I didn't sta d up for her. \n\nWe stopped talking to Vivian, Tina started being more assertive about me, she started ordering and demanding that I give her all my attention and not anyone else, I wasn't even \"allowed\" to talk to others regarding academics or sports, I waa well known in my university for being good  in all fields and hence I know a lot of people. Whenever I was seen talking to others or even coming with them to the class, Tina was rage out and wouldn't talk to for that day. It became to the point where it was draining me and I realised this wasn't how a friendship should feel like. Soon our places changed and I was made to sit with her ex best friend (whom she started talking to again btw) and another friend of mine, I was cautious on not talking much to her ex best friend and rather focused talking to my friend beside me. Tina didn't like that. She started being passive aggressive about it and always made some meekly comments like \"oh looks like you have settled there\",\"looks like u they like you\" etc. It came to the point where Tina once blantely ignored me the whole day and I reached my limit and stopped approaching her and started being with the people who actually wanted my company. Tina didn't like that, I didn't care. Soon I stopped waiting for her at the university entrance and set boundaries. Tina sent me a bunch of long text messages calling me a manipulator, gaslighter, fake and an attention seeker. I was pretty much taken aback by her tone and these msgs and told her to mind her words. She replied with \"if you are triggered then I am right and you are wrong.\" This always happened, whenever we had a issue which we could have sorted out,she would always reply with \"I'm right and you are wrong\". She was always rude and she called it being brutally honest or just really straight forward. Whenever I try to solve things with others, she would butt in and say that I'm sugar coating stuff and just ruin the whole thing. \n\nNeedless to say, after being called a fake person by the person who I considered as a sister, I firmed down and said that it would be better if we stay at a distance and not interact much, for which she replied with \"oh so now you are confident that you have around you, sure (my name) sure.\" I was just speechless how she just changed her whole personality that day. She didn't want me to break the friendship and said that she as my \"best friend\" (which she didn't like calling me that when I am in a good spotlight, only when it's in a bad spotlight) would never wanted to accuse me for nothing unless and until I am that of what she told. She told that I should take accountability for my mistake and apologise to her. She didn't want me gone but she still didn't want me to not talk to people, when she could talk to anyone and everyone, only I was the one restricted to it. \n\nSoon after I cut things off with her, she jumped to another group and became close to them, but that group also left her and she had no one but her first ex best friend to suck up to, she is right now in their group and is spreading things about me, not that I care since I have enough screenshots of her threatening me to back myself up, but there's still thus lingering thought that maybe I might the asshole, so AITA ???
