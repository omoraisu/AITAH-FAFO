      "selftext": "(LONG POST WARNING) I (24f) have been friends with this girl (also 24f) for almost four years now. We met online because of a shared passion for a certain genre of music/several of the same bands and are semi long distance, living in bordering states about 4-5 hours apart. We\u2019ve met up in person quite a few times for concerts and conventions and have traveled together. My friend is obsessed with concerts and traveling, as am I, and our favorite bands don\u2019t come to where she lives while they do frequently come to a city closer to me, so she does have to travel a lot for shows and does so very often, not only to my city but wherever her favorite groups are playing, particularly her all time favorite band she follows everywhere. She has seen them 14 times and already has a ticket to see them next year. \n\nHowever, she is 24 and has never had a real job, not even fast food. (by real job I mean anything you have to submit your SSN for.) She pet sits and house sits for a few families in her neighborhood occasionally, has done freelance \u201cwork\u201d for her family\u2019s business she has no interest in pursuing as a career because she would have to put in effort (her words, not mine.) All of her resume \u201cwork\u201d experiences are just orgs she signed up for in college. She graduated with a digital marketing degree in 2023 and it seems like she just expected a job would fall into her lap with a bachelor\u2019s, despite never doing any sort of job or internship to gain experience (because it would have taken away her ability to do out of state concerts.) She also has told me she doesn\u2019t want to get a full time job because her life right now is so flexible and she gets paid (albeit not that much, I don\u2019t know how exactly much she makes but I know it\u2019s less than 500 a week or $25k/year) to sit around and eat other people\u2019s food and watch Youtube. \n\nShe is in a decent amount of credit card debt from her trips and has borrowed money from her dad to pay for things in college although he has put his foot down more after she graduated and doesn\u2019t give her as much nowadays. She and I were on the phone recently as she was congratulating me on starting a new job with a significant raise this month, and she started talking about potential career opportunities she could do. I was excited she had ideas, but every single one was \u201cwell, I guess not because that\u2019s too hard/I\u2019d need a long training period for that/or to go back to school.\u201d \n\nShe then went on to reiterate that she wasn\u2019t sure about even getting a regular 9-5 office job in her field because she wouldn\u2019t have very much PTO starting out and her number one priority in 2025 is seeing her band as many times as she possibly can, and that she was thinking about getting a remote job instead. I know I should have expected it from her, but I was legitimately shocked. I told her that not only does it show me how out of touch she is with reality since all my friends with remote jobs work way more than I do and have to take the same amount of PTO, and that she has gone way beyond being a fangirl and is prioritizing this band over her future, and sooner or later they won\u2019t be active at all anymore and in 5 or 10 years she\u2019ll be left at home making next to no money and mooching off of her aging parents, floundering to get new pet sitting clients if and when the neighborhood families move and their pets start to pass away. She looked at me like I had just kicked her dog in the face and hung up on me and hasn\u2019t texted me since. I don\u2019t think I said anything offensive but clearly her family isn\u2019t having these conversations in a way that\u2019ll get thru to her. AITAH? ",
