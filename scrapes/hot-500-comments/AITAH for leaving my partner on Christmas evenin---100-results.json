      "selftext": "Context. Me and my partner have been together almost a decade, we have just had our first baby together, he will be 6 months old Christmas.\nMy partner works at a job where people have to work Christmas. This Christmas was his Christmas to work nights, so he would be leaving ours at 4.30pm to go to work. I made the plan to invite his family over in the morning before work, cook a Christmas dinner and when he went to work on the evening. I was going to go to my moms and spend the evening there with my baby (she is having Christmas dinner with my brother but they want the evening alone as a family) \n\nMy partner has just informed me after telling me for 6 months he would be working Christmas that he\u2019s managed to get it off.\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets tricky, him and my mom do not get along, I don\u2019t really understand why, my mom likes him but my partner doesn\u2019t like her, she is very warm to him and recently bought him loads for his birthday but he\u2019s just never taken to her. He always says he will spend the day at hers with me but cancels last minute, my mom cooked a big dinner not long ago and he cancelled 10 minutes before, my mom in anger told me he wasn\u2019t welcome anymore but later apologised. He hasn\u2019t seen her since.\n\nI said to my partner that I will still be seeing my mom Christmas evening as that was the original plan and otherwise she will be alone Christmas evening. (He won\u2019t want me to invite her to the house) but he has told me I cannot take my baby to see her as \u2018I am taking him away from him Christmas Day when he got it off work\u2019 but I explained that, this was the original plan, and I will just be seeing my mom for a few hours in the evening. He has since gone in a mood saying how he managed to get it off (which I didn\u2019t know until today) and said how he\u2019s going to work Christmas Day after all (all because I\u2019d be seeing my mom for a few hours whilst he would be at our house with his family who I am cooking for) \n\nI think he\u2019s wrong, he thinks I\u2019m wrong, \nWho is the asshole here please? Please let me know if you need any more context ",
