      "selftext": "Small scale, but I\u2019m so curious if I am the asshole for asking a dude at the park if he had a leash for his dog. His dog came over to my toddler, baby, and stroller and he didn\u2019t say anything. Just stood there. He was a total dick about it and gave me a ton of attitude saying that he \u201cdidn\u2019t want my opinion\u201d so I gave it back telling him that it\u2019s a rule of the park.\n\nSeriously - what\u2019s the rule here? People always have their dogs off-leash despite the park stating \u201cnon aggressive dogs allowed if they are on a leash no longer than 6 feet\u201d. Everyone thinks their dog is special and that strangers love when they run up to them. ",

This is often a surprise to non-dog-people, who tend to be convinced that there is a blanket law requiring dogs to be leashed at all times. They are often highly resistant to hearing otherwise, but while this tends to be set at the municipal level, and thus can vary from place to place, in much of North America at least the law tends to be as I describe.\n\n\"Under control\" tends not to be defined in these by-laws, but generally being reasonably responsive to a recall command suffices.\n\nSo, an off-leash dog might well come up and give you a sniff. It's legal. The owner is not required to have a leash, let alone to show you one.",
