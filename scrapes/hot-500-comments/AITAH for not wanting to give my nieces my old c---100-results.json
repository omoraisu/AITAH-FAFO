      "selftext": "hi im 21F, living at home with parents. i recently upgraded from a regular pc to a gaming pc. the old one was a fairly good hp pc that was running well, about 4 years old, and originally costed around $550. i upgraded to a gaming pc because i have saved up and want to play heavier games. my mom said that i give the old pc to my 9 and 10 year old nieces. i kind of got frustrated because i feel like it's not just a hand-me-down, and it wasn't cheap. they are also kids that i honestly don't trust to use and keep it in good condition. \n\non the other hand, i do feel kind of mean for not giving it to them even though i am literally not using it. i did not directly tell my mom i don't want to give it to them, but i feel obligated to now.
