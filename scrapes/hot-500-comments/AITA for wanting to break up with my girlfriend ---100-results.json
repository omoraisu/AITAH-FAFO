      "selftext": "So I **(21M)** have been with my girlfriend **(24F)** for just coming up on 6 months we are pretty serious about each other and I was sure this girl was my future that was until yesterday after recent doctor visits due to other reasons she confided in me that she has **HPV** my first thought was that she had cheated on me but then she confessed that she had contracted it from her first boyfriend several years ago and meant to tell me when we started getting serious but **\"forgot\"** to tell me. **For context** we haven't slept together yet as we both had pretty messy relationships in the past and decided it would be best to wait until at least engagement. I feel deceived and I'm not sure how to go forward from here to be clear I don't have any prejudice against people with any STI I'm more concerned with the fact this was kept from me and if we end up together does that mean that I have to willingly give myself an STI? which has lead me to think about breaking up with her which makes me feel like I'm punishing her for something that wasn't her fault and she doesn't think its a big deal **so AITA?**\n\n**tldr gf \"forgot\" to tell me she has HPV and now I'm thinking about leaving her**\n\n**Added context:** We have only gotten serious this last six months we have been a thing for over a year but broke up for a 4 month period before this where she did sleep with other people also I don't have HPV I know this because when we got back together she made me do a full STI panel so I feel like not telling me when the topic has come up previous is a major red flag ",

There is something like an 80% lifetime incidence if you are sexually active, the exception being if you and your partner are each others\u2019 only partners in both of your lifetimes.\n\nThe vast majority are asymptomatic and unrecognized, meaning partners may never know they had it. MALE patients are not routinely tested for HPV* so you could contract it and then give it to every subsequent partner without knowing. Consider, if you have had any sexual partners in the past, that you may already have it. Edited to add: there is no routinely used penile test. For men having insertive penile sex (meaning their penis in someone else\u2019s whatever), there is no routine test.\n*if you are male having receptive anal sex with other males, you may need routine anal screening, just as a female having receptive vaginal or anal sex with males need routine cervical and (depending) anal screening. (Purposely using biological sex instead of gender here).\n\nIt generally clears on its own but certain types are high risk for causing cervical, anal, or throat cancer. The non-cancerous types can still be aesthetically worrisome (eg genital, oral or anal warts).\n\nProtect yourself and future partners from cancer and a (often) silent disease by getting the HPV vaccine.

We were \"high school sweethearts.\" We had been together for four years, and I was the only one faithful, and he was the only one I'd ever been with at the time. We didn't know all the things back in the 80s that we do now about STIs or HPV. After my pap was abnormal, they biopsied my cervix, and it came back with pre-cancerous cells. To treat it, they froze my cervix to kill the first layer of tissues/cells and allow new healthy cells to grow. Once I recovered and healed from these procedures, I went in for a follow-up pap smear to make sure I had a \"normal\" or \"negative\" pap smear. I've been fine since. This was called a colposcopy and biopsy, which I think is the same procedure they use today for HPV. I did remarry and had three beautiful, healthy children.\n\nAs far as breaking up with your girlfriend... You said you guys hadn't been sexually active together yet, and you had been dating off and on until just the past six months. I think it would be ashamed if you think you found \"the one\" and then decided this was the reason to break up with her. She didn't ask for this, and unfortunately, the person who gave it to her may not have known he had it. Maybe she hadn't confided in you previously because she also needed to be sure she could trust you with such an intimate and difficult part of her life. Finding that right person, that special someone is worth the \"for better or worse and in sickness and in health...\" especially when there are treatments and preventions. Perhaps you two should have some further conversations. Is she still positive? Has she sought treatment? (If she's not, she didn't really even have to share, so be thankful for the type of open and honest woman you've found.) If she is still positive, would she be willing to seek treatment, and if so, will YOU be willing to be by her side through it (because I can tell you it sucks)? For the progress of your relationship, in moving forward, it would seem like the proper conversations to have IMO.",

We didn&#39;t know all the things back in the 80s that we do now about STIs or HPV. After my pap was abnormal, they biopsied my cervix, and it came back with pre-cancerous cells. To treat it, they froze my cervix to kill the first layer of tissues/cells and allow new healthy cells to grow. Once I recovered and healed from these procedures, I went in for a follow-up pap smear to make sure I had a &quot;normal&quot; or &quot;negative&quot; pap smear. I&#39;ve been fine since. This was called a colposcopy and biopsy, which I think is the same procedure they use today for HPV. I did remarry and had three beautiful, healthy children.</p>\n\n<p>As far as breaking up with your girlfriend... You said you guys hadn&#39;t been sexually active together yet, and you had been dating off and on until just the past six months. I think it would be ashamed if you think you found &quot;the one&quot; and then decided this was the reason to break up with her. She didn&#39;t ask for this, and unfortunately, the person who gave it to her may not have known he had it. Maybe she hadn&#39;t confided in you previously because she also needed to be sure she could trust you with such an intimate and difficult part of her life. Finding that right person, that special someone is worth the &quot;for better or worse and in sickness and in health...&quot; especially when there are treatments and preventions. Perhaps you two should have some further conversations. Is she still positive? Has she sought treatment? (If she&#39;s not, she didn&#39;t really even have to share, so be thankful for the type of open and honest woman you&#39;ve found.) If she is still positive, would she be willing to seek treatment, and if so, will YOU be willing to be by her side through it (because I can tell you it sucks)? For the progress of your relationship, in moving forward, it would seem like the proper conversations to have IMO.</p>\n</div>",

If you do have a strain, most likely it will clear on its own- but you may want to tell partners that you don\u2019t know and there\u2019s no way to test, so that they can decide for themselves; just as your girlfriend was respectful enough to inform you of her test result before engaging in activities that could pass it on to you.\n\nLack of routine male penile testing is part of why it\u2019s so common. Yes, you are implicated if you didn\u2019t get the vaccine before becoming sexually active. As others have said, condoms don\u2019t protect against 100% though it does reduce male to female transmission rates ~70% according to research, and reduces rates of penile glans and shaft infection by ~50-70% among male volunteers who got tested during the course of the study (better but not perfect.

There is options though and it\u2019s not a death sentence of a disease. </p>\n\n<p>As far as her not telling you sooner, hmmm it sounds like you guys are taking things slow and I really think that her hesitation to tell you out the gate isn\u2019t so terrible, given the fact that you\u2019re taking about holding off until at least engagement to have sex. To me that says she\u2019s exposing herself at a rate that matches the speed of the development of your relationship.</p>\n</div>",
