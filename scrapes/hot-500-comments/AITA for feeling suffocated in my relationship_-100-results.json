I am unable to think freely, do things freely , feeling like as if someone caged me, I'm bored of this relationship, wanting to go out and date other women. I find a problem or two in this girl but trust me I am done with this stuff, I can't ditch her because it'll break her heart but staying here is breaking my mind day by day. I'm done with this shit, kindly guide me",
