      "selftext": "My wife and I had a rocky start in our relationship together, my family not liking her and being toxic about her, and me being over seas in the military. After we had our first kid I decided to leave the military on her constant arguing and fighting of me being in. Shortly after she got pregnant with our second and my family became more toxic against her. I ended up cutting them off.  Few years later we buy a house and have our 3rd child. In 2019 weeks sell our house and move. Then Covid hits we fall on hard times we rack up a debt. Now it\u2019s constant berating I don\u2019t do enough I\u2019m not a real man why can\u2019t I be more like this person or more like that person. She doesn\u2019t work at all she does do a lot of the house work but not all. We both take turns cooking. I bring in all the money that keeps everything going but we are barely  making enough to pay down our debt. Now recently I find out she has an old fling she talks to from before we were together. She swears it\u2019s only as a friend. There is no likely hood of them ever doing anything because he lives on the other side of the United States. But when ever I ask her to stop talking to him she gets defensive. If he was a child hood friend i would have no problem with it but this is an ex sexual partner and when ever we get in a fight she is sure to remind me of that. I have no female friends at all she would loose it if I did. And lately it seems we are constantly fighting and when we do she gets really toxic with it lately talking about my childhood being raised by an addict and I\u2019m useless. I\u2019m reaching my breaking point. She refuses for us to see counseling. I see individual counseling for my military time and think therapy is good. I love my children and no matter what happens I\u2019ll be the best dad possible and I feel that\u2019s the only reason I haven\u2019t gone through the divorce along with if I did I would literally be on the streets. I would never ask her to leave the home with the kids but I literally have no one I can stay with or turn to for help. Once again I\u2019m at my breaking point and don\u2019t know what to do. Divorce seems more and more like a reality .\n\nThanks in advance for advice or thoughts.",
