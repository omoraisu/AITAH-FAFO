      "selftext": "I (19f) just started dating a guy (21M) he is everything I want and nice and caring and we met in college\nBackstory I was with a guy when I was younger(44M) I had a kid for him in February 2023, and since then I cannot mentally handle being with a child and having a kid cause of the  psychological damage, the pregnancy and the trauma, of what happened to me \n the kids stays with my parents back in my home Country . I do not associate with the child I just greet him the same way I greet my younger siblings and talk to them.\n now I\u2019m back to the present My Bf went to my house to get something for me when I was in school and he came across my pregnancy stuffs the medical bills  and discharge letter from the hospital that were in my wardrobe when he was looking for my sweater and he saw the evidence for my pregnancy and now he\u2019s mad that I did not tell him I had a kid.  because one of his deal breaker is that he did not want children or to be with a single mom but I thought cause I\u2019m not in the kids life it\u2019s different .\nI don\u2019t like talking about this child cause it brings back bad memories am trying to erase and I don\u2019t plan on having kids ever again . He\u2019s basically my sibling that does not make me a single mom.  now things  are wrong between us. Well, he\u2019s very mad. He said that he does not care that as far as I have a kid I should have told him, but I do not take care of the kid. I\u2019m not involved in the child\u2019s life. My parents do everything pay his bills and everything so now I\u2019m confused. He left with his friend. He said that he needs to go cool cause he think I\u2019m not understanding his point .\nSo AITA?\nEDIT:His my boyfriend I don\u2019t know what going on with that title and we have been together for 4 months Also I was 13 and the father of the baby was 40 and was my tutor when we started dating ",
