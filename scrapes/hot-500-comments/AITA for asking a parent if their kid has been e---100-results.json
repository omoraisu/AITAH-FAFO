      "selftext": "I\u2019ve been very nervous to post this because I\u2019m sure this a polarized topic but it has been weighing heavily on my mind and I decided to get the internet\u2019s opinion. I used to work at a daycare and I adored this job. I always looked for the good in each kid and went out of my way to know things about each of the kids to establish a relationship. \n\nI noticed that one of the kids had been really struggling. He is a super smart kid but there have been constant behavior issues stemming from not listening. He would be all over the place running around and constantly play fighting with other kids. He wasn\u2019t being mean he was trying to play but a lot of kids got hurt. When we tried to talk to him about his behavior he would completely check out. I know most kids do but this was like he couldn\u2019t pay attention. It wasn\u2019t the only time there were several times mid conversation he would be completely distracted. To be fair he was 5, but it seemed to be more of an issue for him then the other 5 year olds. \n\nFor other context I have adhd and so does my fianc\u00e9. We were both diagnosed later in life and we both have the sentiment that we WISH someone had caught it or said something because it is so much harder finding out as an adult. There is a huge possibility that our own 4 year old has it as well so we have been paying attention to the signs that younger children exhibit and we are pretty sure he might as well. The point being if his teacher told us he should be evaluated I wouldn\u2019t even blink. I do understand that I am more prepared for this then someone who doesn\u2019t know adhd runs in their family but I\u2019ve always struggled with people that don\u2019t accept problems with their \u201cperfect\u201d kids. (Also I don\u2019t think adhd means anyone is less then it\u2019s just a different neuro type)\n\nKnowing all of this I decided to ask the parent about her son. I\u2019ve never been the best at reading social situations and decided to approach as directly and gently as I could. My exact wording was \u201chey, (to catch her attention) has kid been evaluated for adhd? I only ask because when we are talking to him it seems like he has a really hard time paying attention and I don\u2019t think he is doing it on purpose. He is a good kid and I just think he might be struggling.\u201d\n\nShe then glanced at a little list we have to get the kids to behave (this was not my idea but I have to follow the bosses ideas) that was the naughty and nice list. The kid in question was on the naughty list (he wasn\u2019t the only one on naughty) and in a rush I told her that he had started a lot of fights today. I didn\u2019t want her to think he was on the naughty list because of possible attention issues. I admit I said this part to hastily and without enough care but I was incredibly anxious about asking about adhd. \n\nI didn\u2019t want to leave things on a sour note so I mentioned how smart I thought he was and that he was a good kid. And she even seemed ok saying sometimes I think he is to smart for his own good. I thought everything was fine but it wasn\u2019t. \n\nThe next day she complained to the big boss over my boss (we were a daycare for employees) and I was fired that day. They said parents shouldn\u2019t have to know bad things and to lie if I have too. And that I wasn\u2019t licensed to diagnose so I should have said nothing. (I wasn\u2019t trying to diagnose and if he did have adhd and she didn\u2019t want to tell me I wouldn\u2019t have pressed). It feels awful and I can\u2019t stop thinking about it. I just wanted to help because I didn\u2019t want the same thing to happen to him that happened to my fianc\u00e9 and I. And yes things could change because of young he is but it was more to put it on the parents radar. I wasn\u2019t trying to say the kid was bad or dumb. \n\nSo Am I The Asshole? Or was this situation blown out of proportion? What are your opinions? ",
