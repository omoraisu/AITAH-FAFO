      "selftext": "My husband (32 M) has been having medical problems (I feel like he might be milking them) since 2019. He hasn't had a job and just gives excuses left and right about not getting one. Since 2019, I've worked multiple jobs at once and went to college at the same time. I've lost several jobs and there was a time during the pandemic where we were homeless. That year he also donated a kidney to his father and further used it as an excuse to why he couldn't help me make ends meet. After I eventually started making enough money to move into a new apartment. He swore up and down that he would help, but he never did and I relied on charities for years to pay rent. He then insisted we take in his sister's child who she abandoned at the hospital. Stating that \"children were easy to take care of\" and that he would take on the responsibility. However, the baby didn't sleep for four whole days at one point. I was forced to stay home from work and I lost my job. Now I'm back to job hopping again, hoping that something sticks. He then said that we needed to move into a bigger home since we had the baby and that he would help with rent. I am now in severe debt that I'll probably never crawl out of and I cannot keep up with rent due to this. \n\nBack in June I had gone on tiktok on our family tablet and had it suggest a random channel to me that sounded familiar. I hadn't seen it before, but the names struck me as similar to a random email my husband made. I figured out how to log into it and realized that he had been using tiktok during the pandemic to watch underage girls dance on the app. Some of them were sexually suggestive (one where a girl flashes her breasts through a reflection on a window). I brought this up to him as well as the fact that I had found him paying for porn when we're homeless too. He got angry and started throwing things at me; which included a chair. He smashed my laptop and stormed out, saying he was gonna kill himself. He then came back crying and saying he didn't remember any of it. He claims he has DID. I should mention at the this point that we haven't had sex in 4 years because he claims he's asexual and that his penis doesn't work due to his medical condition. \n\nRecently, his dad was diagnosed with leukemia and has been in and out of the hospital in the past month. I went to go use the WIC card today to get formula for the now toddler, but the card didn't work. When I called my husband (and I was reasonably upset), I was met with \"I haven't slept in two days. I can't believe that you'd expect me to be perfect and remember to renew the WIC card\". (For more context. The toddler is austic due to being born addicted to drugs thanks to my husband's sister. He doesn't eat solid food and this is almost his only form of food. The formula comes out $80/box)\n\nI really don't think I'm the asshole here, but it really feels like my husband doesn't actually care about me or the child he's forced me to take care of. \n\nSide note: I recently found a new job and I can't request a weekday off to take care of the WIC card or they'll fire me. I'm a commercial HVAC tech. This means I work very long shifts going up and down ladders all day. ",
