      "selftext": "AITA for responding the way I did after my former best friend ended our friendship?\n\nHi, Reddit. This is a messy situation, but here goes. My (22F) former best friend, \u201cclaire\u201d (22F), and I had been close for years. She was someone I genuinely cared about, but things between us started to fall apart after a series of misunderstandings and emotional conflicts.\n\nA few months ago, Claire\u2019s mom tragically passed away after battling cancer. I was in Texas during that time because i had some family things i had to take care of, and had no car or transportation because i was living in idaho at the time for college , and while I wasn\u2019t able to make it to the funeral, I was close enough to potentially be there for her. She asked if I could attend her mom\u2019s funeral, and I said I\u2019d ask my mom about it since I didn\u2019t have control over my transportation at the time. i was only in texas for 5 days and two of those days were flying and the other three were for some plans my family had made MONTHS ahead, and had no way of cancelling them. Unfortunately, it didn\u2019t work out, as i was told that i could not go. i even argued with my mom and ruined the trip over it bedauwd i desperately tried going there, and I deeply regret not being able to be there for her.\n\nClaire brought this up in a heartfelt message recently, sharing that my lack of support during her mom\u2019s passing left her feeling abandoned. She also said she felt like I prioritized my family, and was \u201cworking so much i never had time for her\u201d even though i was texting and/or calling her multiple times a day and ruining my sleep schedule because this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s accused me of prioritizing my family and life over her and neglected her emotional needs during one of the worst times of her life. any time she would see me with my other friends, i was accused of putting her on the \u201cbackburner\u201d and that i don\u2019t care about her. and when i would mention my other friends in conversation, she would shut down and try to change the subject. mind you i am a full time worker who is in college and trying to pay out of pocket. \n\nWhen I first got her message, I apologized immediately. I told her that I understood where she was coming from and that I was sorry for making her feel invalidated or unsupported. I thought we had reached some kind of resolution because she accepted my apology at the time, and I genuinely believed we were moving forward. But then, days later, she sent another message saying she had decided she couldn\u2019t move past everything and wanted to end our friendship.\n\nIn her final message, Claire expressed that she had been forgiving me for a long time, but she felt I never made meaningful changes. She accused me of being selfish, overly focused on how others perceive me, and not caring enough about her pain. She said she felt she was waiting to use her mom\u2019s passing in case of an argument after the first time we talked. now i am not trying to sway anyone\u2019s opinions because i HATE when people do that, but i do think it\u2019s a little strange she wanted to wait to use that in an argument against me if things did go south. \n\nI responded as honestly as I could, explaining that I had been dealing with a lot of stress and personal challenges at the time. I told her that my lack of presence wasn\u2019t due to a lack of care but logistical and emotional struggles I was going through. i had been having a lot of emotional stress and some very concerning thoughts constantly that i needed to get treatment for, and she was aware of this and had told me many times that it was okay and she was very supportive. i tried to communicate during these times often. I also pointed out that many of these issues hadn\u2019t been communicated to me directly\u2014at least not in the blunt, clear way they were in her final message. I wanted her to know that I genuinely cared about her, but I also wanted to provide context for why I acted the way I did.\n\nClaire didn\u2019t take my response well. She accused me of making excuses and justifying everything to make myself look better. She said I was insensitive and that my response proved I only cared about myself. She also said that me mentioning feeling like I had to walk on eggshells was insulting and untrue because she felt she had gone above and beyond to be patient with me.\n\nSince then, Claire has cut all contact with me. I\u2019ve been left reflecting on the entire situation and wondering if I\u2019m truly as selfish as she says. I feel like I\u2019ve owned up to my mistakes and tried to communicate my side of things, but maybe I could have done more.\nafter this i get a message from one of her friends, m24, and is attacking me for not being there for her all the time. i tried to defend myself, and it is a literal message in the berating comments that i received that all i can do is try to defend myself. multiple times with this friend group i tried to make everyone happy and reached out when i could, but any time i was busy or struggling, i was met with nasty messages from both Claire and David. i talked to my therapist and a couple of people that are trained in this kind of stuff, and they said that i was not the AH and did the right thing in my messages.\n\nSo, Reddit, AITA for how I handled this situation? Should I have responded differently, or is there no way I could have salvaged this friendship?",
