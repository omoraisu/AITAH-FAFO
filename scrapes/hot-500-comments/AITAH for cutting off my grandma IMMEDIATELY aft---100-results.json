      "selftext": "My (28f) paternal grandma (70 something f) has always been a piece of work. She is one of those eternally negative people, who never has anything nice to say about anyone. Her own kids, my father included, can only take her in doses because of her antics. These antics include, but are in no way limited to:\n\nLiterally walking behind the Starbucks counter to make her own drink because the 16-year old barista accidentally brushed the inside of the empty cup with one singular finger\n\nBlaming her poor parenting on menopause and my dad \u201cnot being the brightest\u201d\n\nNasty comments on the side of the family that she has only ever seen a handful of times on her entire life\n\nAnd the most relevant, racist comments about Hispanic people\n\nSo that brings us two a couple years ago. For the record, the entirety of my dad\u2019s family is white, with me and my daughter being the exception. I am mixed (half black), and my daughter is half Mexican. I promise this will matter later.\n\nAbout three years ago, I was a newly single mother after a particularly brutal break up with my daughters father  when my grandma had sent me a text to tell me that B had passed away. B, my grandma\u2019s husband was a wonderful man. Since he came into her life when me and my brothers were children, he was always kind, funny, generous, and positive. I think we all kind of wondered how such opposites could attract the way they did. But I truly enjoyed him, though I didn\u2019t know him very well being that they lived so far away and the relationship between grandma and dad was strained, leading to infrequent visits. When he\u2019d passed, he\u2019d been sick for well over a decade, losing his memory and being homebound for the majority of that time. While it wasn\u2019t necessarily a shock that he had passed away, it was sad news.\n\nQueue my stepmom, brother, me, and my daughter heading to the west coast for the memorial. It was a wonderful service and it was beautiful to see all the loves this genuine man had touched.\n\nHowever, what wasn\u2019t beautiful was the fact that I showed up with a 7-month old that no one had known existed. Awkward was an understatement. But truly, I didn\u2019t care all that much and just assumed that grandma hadn\u2019t told anyone because she was embarrassed that I was a single mom. Wouldn\u2019t have been a stretch to assume, really.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t prepare for was a later conversation I\u2019d have with my brother, where he\u2019d told me what she\u2019d said. Basically, when the service was over, my stepmom, daughter, and I road separately in one car, and my brother and grandma in another. While I don\u2019t know how the topic of grandma not telling anyone about my daughter had come up, my brother said that grandma stated she didn\u2019t tell anyone because \u201cshe didn\u2019t want to have to explain the race of the baby\u201d. It\u2019s important to note that my grandma has previously said negative things about Hispanic people, though never so \u201cdirectly\u201d, more of that subtle type racism.\n\nI was livid. We left the very next day, and I\u2019ve barely spoken to her since. My stepmom, always the peacekeeper (with the best of intentions, we love her I promise) has tried to bridge the gap multiple times, but I have never been able to forgive this. The way I see it, she is either racist against my daughter, or willingly put my daughter in a situation where other around her felt some kind of way about her without letting me know prior. And I don\u2019t take that lightly.\n\nNow, here\u2019s where I may be the A-hole. My stepmom has reminded me multiple times that grandma\u2019s health seems to be rapidly deteriorating, and with so many people in the family having limited to not contact with her, she\u2019s becoming lonely and isolated. I know what it would mean to her if I tried to bridge the gap. And I\u2019ve been told I hold grudges. Should I be over this all these years later? Should I try to give her a chance? I need to know if I\u2019m being vindictive here, cutting her out of my life and putting surrounding family in situations where it\u2019s either her presence or mine and my daughters. Am I mama bearing too hard? Or am I doing the right thing by my daughter?",
