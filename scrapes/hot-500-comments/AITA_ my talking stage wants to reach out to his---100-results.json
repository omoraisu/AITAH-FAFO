      "selftext": "AITA for feeling weird about my talking stage reaching out to his ex-fiance\n\nI met a guy about 2 and a half months ago (on Reddit actually lol). He was fully engaged earlier this same year but it didn\u2019t work out. \n\nNow fast forward, we have been talking daily since we met, things have been great overall, we clicked as good friends early and can see it becoming more.\n\nHowever, this is where I\u2019m getting very confused. He has been drafting a message to send to his ex-finance and claims the purpose of the message is to clear things up and make it his last message to her. His ex was having mental health issues and he believes he is the best person in her life to help her get through those struggles. The message involves him telling her to take care of herself and he wants to give his friends number over to her in case she needs any help during any other crisis. I think that any and all communication with an ex fianc\u00e9 should end when you start a new talking stage with a whole different person. She knows very well who she is able to reach out to and not reach out to, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s his job anymore to worry about that. \n\nFurther, I think it\u2019s weird that he\u2019s considering her so much. I have been extremely clear about how I feel about this and that I am not okay with it, however he still keeps bringing up the message thing. He also told me he won\u2019t do it if I tell him not to but I think he shouldn\u2019t put me in this weird position in the first place. \n\nRecently, I asked him if there has been any communication between him and his ex, he told me no. However later, he told me she wished him happy birthday very recently but he didn\u2019t respond. I definitely believe that counts as contact, he should\u2019ve told me that earlier. He actually wanted to send her his draft on her birthday but decided against it. Now he\u2019s wanting to send it to her some other day, and also won\u2019t let me see the draft. \n\nI feel like I\u2019m being silly believing him and I\u2019m disrespecting myself. He lives in a whole other state and I try to trust him but I can\u2019t comfortably do that under these circumstances. Further I\u2019m a law student trying to study for the bar exam. I was willing to even move states to be with him but I\u2019m not sure if this is the type of person I would want to be with. Am I trippin? Please help me with some advice and opinions thank you!!
