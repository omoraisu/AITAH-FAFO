      "selftext": "So, I have bene dating my boyfriend for almost 5 years, we have been dating since high school, and we are in our early 20s. My relationship with his family has never been  close one since we\u2019ve spent most of our relationship hanging outside his family home and they have never invited me to things unless it was a big extended family event. However, I have always been very kind and respectful to them. They have never really been too interested in my life either and never ask me questions about myself but I just assumed that they were too busy or distracted when we would talk.\n\n(His family and I have vastly different political and religious views but I never thought that would be an issue.) \n\nHowever, in the last two years or so, their feelings about me seemed to have shifted to disliking me and/or judgmental of me, which I believe stems from our differing views. Most of what they say is behind my back and I\u2019ve heard about it from my boyfriend. They have talked about how \u201chigh maintenance\u201d I am. When my cat was diagnosed with cancer and I had to nurse her, his family told my boyfriend that I should \u201cjust take her out back and shoot her.\u201d Recently they have even looked up my family\u2019s personal info such as our homes, jobs, salaries, etc. instead of just asking me, they then proceeded to show their extended family this personal info. \n\nMost recently, at Thanksgiving time, his family went to their home near a lake to celebrate the holiday and they didn\u2019t invite me. Since they didn\u2019t invite me and it would\u2019ve been a three hour drive from where my boyfriend is at school he decided to spend Thanksgiving at my families home. We had a really great time even though he got a lot of backlash from his family.\n\nAfterwards, his cousin ended up telling us that his father had gone on a rant in front of the family + extended family about how my boyfriend was spending Thanksgiving with his \u201cnew family\u201d and that I am \u201cchanging him for worse.\u201d I was very hurt by everything that was said and coupled with everything they have said and done the past few years, I am at the end of my rope with them. \n\nI told my boyfriend that I wanted to go no contact to low contact with his family. Luckily my boyfriend is entirely supportive (and always has been) and even offered to go low contact with them but since they\u2019re paying for his college I told him he shouldn\u2019t. \n\nWhen talking this through with my mom and grandma, my grandma was entirely supportive of me. However, my mother implied that I was being over dramatic and that I should just \u201csuck it up\u201d and not make things harder for my boyfriend. It really made me feel like maybe I was being the asshole.\n\nSo AITAH?",
