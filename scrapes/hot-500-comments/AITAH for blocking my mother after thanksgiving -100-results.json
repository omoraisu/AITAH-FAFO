      "selftext": "I (20f) went on a trip with my mother and brother over thanksgiving. My mother has been emotionally and verbally abusive and manipulative for as long as I can remember in my upbringing. If I gave examples of everything she\u2019s done we\u2019d be here all day. I worked hard throughout high school to save enough money to move out as soon as I turned 18 and most of my problems were solved thereafter. Whenever I\u2019m around her she still tries to tell me what to do despite me being an adult. The trip I was on with my family prior to this incident she yelled at me \u201cyou will obey me because I\u2019m the parent and you\u2019re the child\u201d. Keep in mind I\u2019m 20 years old with my own house and job. I\u2019ve always considered cutting contact but we live in the same town and I love my dad who\u2019s married to her so I\u2019ve put up with her for the sake of not wanting more drama. However, this past thanksgiving I was invited on a trip with my parents and older brother (26yom). I originally said no but I had off of work and it was hard to come up with an excuse so I went after some convincing from my parents. This trip was the absolute worst. My brother lost his temper and cursed me out on many different occasions. My brother has always been an aggressive and violent person and growing up I was always scared of making him snap. To make a long story short, he locked himself out at some point during the trip and proceeded to put the blame on me for speaking and told me to \u201cshut the f up\u201d. He used this exact quote probably 4 more times over the course of 3 days in complete seriousness not in some joking manner. My mother on this same trip posted a picture of me online without asking me and without my knowledge that she even took the picture. I told her that I don\u2019t even have my own social media and I prefer I don\u2019t be posted but she ignored me. About 2 minutes later I said seriously can you delete it. She screamed, yes legit screamed, at me to \u201cshut up\u201d. This was in a public hotel setting and made things quite uncomfortable. The next day we were out at dinner and when everyone was talking she yet again raised her voice and told me specifically to \u201cshut it\u201d telling me to stop talking. She never treats my brother like this but I think part of that is because she\u2019s also scared of how he\u2019ll snap. I had no choice but to push through the rest of the trip and ignore them as best I could. As soon as I got home I blocked both my brother and mother. Well, my mother apparently tried calling me 8 times last night before realizing it wasn\u2019t going through and called me from a different number. Today she showed up at my house when my boyfriend was outside, when he told her I wasn\u2019t coming outside she said \u201ctell her to have a nice life then\u201d and sped off. She then proceeded to email me the following message: \u201cWhat you are doing is very hurtful and harmful. Ghosting wo cause is unjust I cannot help or fix anything if I don't know what is wrong\u201d. Life has been so much more peaceful since I haven\u2019t had to deal with her but everyone else in my life seems to think that cutting her off isn\u2019t fair and to be honest I don\u2019t even know how I\u2019d respond to that message.  My mental health has been so much better without her in my life but maybe I\u2019m not seeing the full picture? I\u2019m already stressing about if I should go to her house for Christmas for my dad\u2019s sake or if it\u2019s just not worth the fight that\u2019s sure to happen. ",
