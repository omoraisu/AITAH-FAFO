      "selftext": "\nI (F23) & My friend (F24) Are big fans of Taylor Swift, We bond over her music and have both seen her in concert before. (Which is why i thought it wasn\u2019t a big deal), we both had trouble getting tickets when they first were on sale so we ended up buying tickets a little later. Which the total cost ended up being $1500 (which she paid for and i was very thankful) She sent me the money but the tickets were on my account so whenever it was time i could send her the information to get in the concert. A while back she asked me to give her back half the money because she said it would be only fair if i gave her back half just so we could be even, i was very confused because if she wanted the money back she should\u2019ve mentioned it when she was first buying the tickets because i did not have the money and i still do not. This led to a huge blowout argument between me and her and considering the fact that we were not on speaking terms i was not going to go to a concert with someone who i\u2019m on bad terms with and also had no contact with, a couple years ago her mother passed away which really affected her and i was there for her through it all. She happens to have a younger sister who wasn\u2019t as close with her mother than she was and wasn\u2019t really affected by her mother\u2019s passing, which cause them to have problems and eventually grow apart. I still kept in contact with her sister because I was very close with her entire family considering the fact i\u2019ve known them for all my teenage years, I called her sister and asked her if she wanted to go with me to the concert because me and her sister were not on speaking terms. (her sister also being a huge fan of t swift) As one would her sister agreed to go with me, The day of the concert her sister found out i was taking her instead and had a big blowout. Calling us both and calling us every vile name you could think of. I personally don\u2019t think it was really necessary for her to get heated up like that because we were in no contact whatsoever, plus the tickets were on my account which means they were my tickets.

You, instead, chose to fight over it and it cost you a friendship. To then invite her sister is beyond the pale as far as I'm concerned. If anyone should have gone it was the two sisters. Now you've been instrumental in driving a wedge between them as well. Smartly done. Hope it was worth it.",
