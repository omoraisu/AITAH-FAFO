      "selftext": "I Just got home from the dog park, public. There were at least a dozen dogs when we arrived. All were getting along just fine. \n\nThis man showed up with his dog, pit mix. His name was Zeus. I know that because I could hear him screaming his name from across the park. \n\nZeus was acting very aggressively, snarling at other dogs, charging at them, biting at them etc. I will give the owner credit for staying close to his dog so he could at least intervene. I heard other owners near me comment on his dog as well. \n\nI started to make my lap around the park and the approach the owner but he ended up leaving. \n\nAITAH if I had asked him to leave and if he returns to muzzle his dog? \n\nI\u2019m not saying mine is perfect my any means. I don\u2019t expect dogs to behave like adults would. \n\nBut damn, it\u2019s one thing when my dog growls at a dog trying to hump him vs his dog aggressively going after other dogs. \n\n",

One of my dogs is reactive towards dogs bc of her abuse and another just doesn\u2019t care for dogs.  I would never take my dogs to the dog park bc it isn\u2019t fair to the other owners and I understand it\u2019s not a place they belong.  People need to know their dogs.  Also, there are people who bring in aggressive dogs so I\u2019m not comfortable leaving my dogs off leash with stranger\u2019s dogs.  But, AH owners who brings an aggressive dog to the dog park are tone deaf and won\u2019t take accept that Muffin needs to wear a muzzle or be banned bc my dog is the sweetest, he just needs socialization.  He only gets reactive blah blah blah.",
