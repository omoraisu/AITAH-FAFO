      "selftext": "I (25F) met Ryan (29M) a year ago through a video game. We played regularly and eventually started trying other games together. Over time, I began noticing Ryan\u2019s attitude toward Josh (28M), someone I\u2019m interested in. Ryan often criticized Josh, which felt odd. I didn\u2019t ask Ryan directly about his feelings because, in the past, I\u2019ve been heavily criticized for asking, \u201c*Are you interested in me?*\u201d and was manipulated into feeling crazy. I was afraid it would happen again, so I kept quiet. Instead, I talked about Josh and our relationship to make it clear I wasn\u2019t interested in Ryan.\n\nRecently, I started a new game, and Ryan followed me there. Another player, Kyle (25M), after a week of playing, I had mentioned Ryan and Josh to him, and Kyle said that he felt the same way as Ryan did. He told me he thought I was flirting with him. For instance, I sometimes call people \u201c*champion*\u201d or cheer them on during fights, but I see it as being friendly, not romantic. My way of flirting is different.\n\nWhen I confronted Ryan, he claimed I had been flirting with him all along but wasn\u2019t romantically interested himself. He cited moments like me jokingly calling him \u201ca man to marry\u201d the first time we played (because he can cook), or a time in the game when I had asked how much he weighed (because the game has a weight system). He responded, \u201c*If I tell you, will you tell me yours?*\u201d and I replied, \u201c*No, in the game, because I think my game bugged*\u201d and he ignored that and told me his real weight anyway. From there, we ended up discussing our physical traits. He even guilted me into sharing a photo of myself after sending me pictures of him unprompted, I didn't want them, later accusing me of flirting through that as well.\n\nI apologized for any misunderstanding and clarified I was only interested in Josh. However, Ryan called me dishonest, and after a very long talk going in circle, he insulted me, and blocked me. I\u2019ve since learned one of his longtime friends recently stopped talking to him due to similar behavior, where he refused to admit he was wrong about something (it wasn't the first time between them), so I wonder if this is a pattern. Kyle thinks I\u2019m the asshole for \u201cleading on\u201d men by being overly friendly and joking with them and that I need to be careful in the future.\n\nNow, I don't know, was I actually flirting and being an asshole, or were my actions misinterpreted? Am I in the asshole ?\n\n**TL;DR**: I was friendly with a guy (Ryan 29M) I met in a video game, but he thought I was flirting. I apologized for the misunderstanding, but he called me dishonest, insulted me, and blocked me. Now I wonder if I was really flirting and by that being the asshole or if he misinterpreted my actions.\n\n",
