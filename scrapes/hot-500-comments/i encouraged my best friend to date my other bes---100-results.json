      "selftext": "hi,\ni\u2019m sorry if my english isn\u2019t the best. it isn\u2019t my mother tongue, so my sincere apologies in advance.\n\ni\u2019m on here cuz i just had to get it all out. i, f(17), have a crush on my best friend, f(18). for the sake of the story, let\u2019s just call her lydia. we\u2019ve known each other for a few years since we\u2019re in the same grade but weren\u2019t in the same class. we only got close about 1.5 years ago when we entered the same courses. i\u2019ve had a crush on her pretty early on\u2014since like a year ago.\n\ni have another best friend, f(19), who we\u2019re just gonna call layla. we\u2019ve been friends for the past 8 years since we share the same hobby and work in the same caf\u00e9.\n\nlayla and i organized an art exhibition at the place we work at, and i invited lydia to perform since she\u2019s a poet. through this, lydia and layla met for the first time and both kinda liked each other but didn\u2019t really know each other well at all. already knowing this made me hold back from telling lydia that i liked her.\n\nthis was in october 2023. in april of this year, i celebrated my birthday and invited layla and lydia among some other friends. after my birthday, they started texting. since the beginning of their dating journey, i was kinda included, especially in the beginning and during their arguments.\n\nat some point in their relationship, lydia and i were talking about our future and when she told that if layla and she had never met, we\u2019d probably already be in a relationship. we both admitted that we\u2019d been in love with each other this whole time but didn\u2019t have the courage to say it out of fear of losing our friendship.\n\nbut like i said, layla and lydia were already dating. lydia didn\u2019t know what to do, so i told her that i\u2019ll always be here for her, and we have our whole lives to figure things out. i said she should really try with layla because i didn\u2019t want to break her heart. layla\u2019s been through a tough time, and she claims i\u2019m the only friend she has left (apart from lydia now, but yk).\n\nso they ended up dating for real. a while before they officially got together, lydia talked to me again about this whole situation, saying the only reason she wasn\u2019t already in a relationship with layla was because of me. i reassured her again that she should try with layla, but i also told her i loved her so much and would wait for her if she needed me.\n\nlater this summer, at the beginning of the break, layla and i met up for an event in her village. we spent the whole time holding hands, cuddling, and talking about how much we loved each other. i felt extremely guilty afterward and apologized because it was disrespectful of me to signal that i liked her both verbally and nonverbally.\n\nduring the break, i stayed at different places, like my sisters\u2019 apartments, who live hours away. between visits, the situation with lydia happened, and i decided to cut contact with both lydia and layla while i was at my second sister\u2019s.\n\nbut i couldn\u2019t sustain it. layla still sent me updates about her and lydia\u2019s relationship, sharing little details and voice messages about the things that made her happy. she also texted me twice to say she missed me and hoped i was okay. lydia gave me the space i asked for, but layla complained when i didn\u2019t reply, even though i\u2019d told her i wouldn\u2019t.\n\nafter about a week and a half, i started talking to them again. a week later, layla and i went on a three-week trip to norway. layla kept texting lydia and telling me all about her, which broke my heart every time. honestly, i didn\u2019t enjoy the trip much because of that.\n\nnowadays, layla and i don\u2019t talk as much anymore\u2014maybe once or twice a week. lydia and i, however, are still really close and touchy. yesterday, we went to a christmas market two hours away because we saw a video and thought it looked nice. we held pinkies to avoid getting lost, shared food, and danced a waltz on the street when we heard music. it was magical and meaningful, but also confusing.\n\nlydia is still with layla, but their relationship seems rocky. they argue a lot, and layla often oversteps lydia\u2019s boundaries.\n\nin my head, it\u2019s still the start of summer, and lydia and i are running hand in hand through a field, walking at night, and watching fireflies dance in the sky. i miss all the things we could have been if i\u2019d just told her i loved her earlier. it shatters my heart to see them kiss, but at the same time, i\u2019m happy my two best friends found love. i\u2019m glad it\u2019s me who\u2019s heartbroken and not them, because i love them both too much to want them to hurt.\n\nif you\u2019ve made it this far, thank you for reading. if you have any tips on how to get over your best friend, feel free to share them.\n\nnote: layla is unaware of the entirety of lydia\u2019s and my situation.\n",
