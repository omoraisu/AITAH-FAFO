Already in 3k+ credit card debt \n2.Student loan debt (if you count that)\n3.Just likes expensive shit\nHe plans on getting an apartment after the spring semester and he just told me about getting a cash car but now he\u2019s about to get a 19,000 car with a 300 a month payment tomorrow. I usually just don\u2019t care whatever the fuck he does but his friends did talk him out getting an apartment in a city an hour away the coming semester. I\u2019m not one to intervene in other peoples business but I think it\u2019s kinda retarded given that we\u2019re RAs and he plans to be one until we graduate. Should I be a good friend or let Darwinism run its course?",
