      "selftext": "I (27F) have been recently disowned by my family as retaliation for going NC with my father. It\u2019s a lifetime of stories for background, but to keep it short and neat:\n\n1. My father does not have any relations or connections other than his mother and his wife (my mother). He\u2019s known for being extremely short-tempered and cutting people off for minor inconveniences or miscommunication, which has cut short any form of friendships. His own family is no exception to this rule: He\u2019s NC with all his siblings, only has strained contact with one nephew and at one point was NC with his own mother for about 8 years.\n2. Throughout my life he\u2019s been extremely paranoid about my intentions in every way possible. Walking on eggshells is an understatement. Even as a child, my words have always been taken in the worst possible light and assumed that I\u2019m always belittling or mocking him. I was falsely accused as a 10yo of stealing items from his office and lying about it, and as a young adult of trying to \u201ctrap him\u201d in a bank scheme to, again, steal all his money (I offered my own overseas account for a transaction that otherwise was impossible to make).\u00a0\n3. My father has repeatedly referred to me as a b\\*tch, even going to the extent to ask my then boyfriend during a family lunch \u201cwhat kind of dog food he\u2019s giving me to keep me so tamed\u201d. I was 16 then. All my relationships have been tainted with harsh screaming matches about how I should be ashamed to \u201cbe used as meat so easily\u201d\n4. He\u2019s not and never has been involved in my life other than providing financial stability. My mother has been the one to change my diapers, clean, feed, school, etc. He has not stayed one night up to attend to his sick child, ever. When I was a young child, he repeatedly put me in danger, like leaving me alone as a 2yo in a beach for 2 hours, shoving me in a pool without proper floating gear or forcing me to climb a mountain on a 12 hour hike that ended with me as a 8yo with hypothermia. He\u2019s not involved in the household either. He doesn't even know where the pans are.\n\nThe straw that broke the camel's back was a fight that broke loose after I came home after staying a weekend in my boyfriend's house (we are both doctors and have been together for about 2 years). I was called a wh\\*re and manipulative egocentric narcissist that disregards any form of respect to the household. I decided then and there that I was done with his sexist attitude and swore to myself that I would not speak with this man if he did not change his ways and apologised.\n\nThe rest of my family has sided with him and have been pressuring me to \u201clet water pass under the bridge\u201d and to remember that he\u2019s a good father, regardless of some mistakes in the past. It has come to the extreme that, if I keep \u201cthis attitude\u201d I\u2019ll promptly be disowned. Me and my boyfriend have been uninvited to christmas dinner and new years eve with my family. I feel deeply betrayed by them.\n\nI\u2019m at a crossroads and I\u2019ve been doubting myself a lot. Please, am I being unreasonable or disproportionate here?",
