      "selftext": "\nI (14M) have been living with a foster family on and off for around 2 years (my bio mum died and my bio dad is an alcoholic) but we\u2019ve been in a bit of a rough spot these past few weeks. I\u2019m almost expelled from school for the second time, I\u2019ve been caught drinking many times and worst of all my girlfriend is pregnant. Obviously that\u2019s making me really stressed out and I guess my temper is a lot worse. Today, the caught me smoking and had a bit of a go at me which led to me getting quite carried away. I told them that I hate them and they\u2019ve done nothing for me and I\u2019d rather be with my actual dad, even if he\u2019s abusive. Anyways, they told my social worker I\u2019m being really ungrateful and shit like that and I have to have a talk with her about it in a few days. It wasn\u2019t that bad that they\u2019d need to tell my social worker and I\u2019m quite pissed at them because I really hate talking to her, which led to another argument. But yeah they\u2019re acting like I\u2019m the worst person in the world even though I just lost my temper a bit. AITA? \n\n(Idk if the flair is needed but I\u2019m just being safe.) ",

        "body": "AH in the situation sure, but OP you have a lot going on here. I can't begin to imagine having so many adult level problems at 14. Without any additional information right now it does seem as though your foster family cares about you. If you are struggling with alcoholism and other addictions you'll need professional help. Developing addictions so young can make it much harder to stop later. Is that state offering those services or providing it for you? No 14 year old wants to hear they need help with issues and can't do something on their own, but adults can't even fight these issues alone. Foster and adoption trauma are also very real things, and you are not alone in your feelings of anger. It might really be helpful to talk through some of these things with someone. The state (usually) can also help provide you with information to potential services for young mothers in your area. Your social worker will probably be able to help you with that if your girlfriend needs care. I'm rooting for you, and hope things start to get easier. Please try not to fight the ones offering help, their frustration is also very real.",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>AH in the situation sure, but OP you have a lot going on here. I can&#39;t begin to imagine having so many adult level problems at 14. Without any additional information right now it does seem as though your foster family cares about you. If you are struggling with alcoholism and other addictions you&#39;ll need professional help. Developing addictions so young can make it much harder to stop later. Is that state offering those services or providing it for you?
