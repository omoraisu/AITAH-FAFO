      "selftext": "A couple times per week, my 9-year-old step daughter will say to either me or my wife, \"Fuck you, bitch! Shut the fuck up!\"\n\nWhenever she speaks this way to my wife -- every single time -- I immediately say, \"You will not speak to your mother that way. Her response is then, \"Fuck you! I will talk to her however I want!\" My reinforcement goes nowhere, but regardless, I feel something should be said; I feel it's the right thing to do to have my wife's back.\n\nHowever, when my step daughter speaks to me this way, my wife often says nothing. Sometimes she says \"Watch your mouth,\" and sometimes she addresses it later. Last time she said to her, a couple hours after she talked to me this way: \"I would appreciate it if you didn't talk back. We are really sorry that you use such ugly words with us. We love you very much, but it's hard to live like this.\"\n\nI told my wife, thank you for addressing it later, but I asked her to please address it in the moment, when it happens. She said she prefers to often remain silent and not to get involved. I told her I need her to address it immediately, in the moment, when it happens, and to reinforce that we won't be spoken to this way. I said I do expect her to reinforce this with her daughter every time it happens.\n\nWhen I told her this, she said, \"I'm not enough. I just can't meet your expectations.\"\n\nAITA for expecting my wife to reinforce with my step daughter, at the time it happens, every time, that she should not speak to me in abusive ways?",

You can also try to do couples and eventually after your stepdaughter has had a few sessions herself to also do family therapy.\n\nYou can also try to get into her interest and ask her about what she likes. Offer to do the things she enjoys with her.\n\nEdit; Reading some of your past post and stuff. You might also need therapy. though i still wouldn't say your the asshole for this you do need to be more understanding. Please remember you're stepping into the daughter's life not the other way around.

When she is being disrespectful to her mother, I\u2019d advise you to stay out of it because that probably just fans the flames of her anger because she sees it as someone who she likely resents at least somewhat not just disciplining her but in the most offensive way possible by telling her how to treat her own mother, with whom she is clearly angry, justifiably or not, and it\u2019s inappropriate for you to insert yourself in that relationship when you may in fact be the embodiment of that anger and since she\u2019s a child, that means she probably also sees you as the source of her anger at her mother even though that\u2019s of course not true.  HOWEVER.  Her mother needs to discipline her for the way she speaks to YOU precisely because you are NOT her parent.  Kids get to take out irrational anger on their parents and it might suck but parents have to take it because they chose to parent and thats the job they chose. Kids need to be able to feel big feelings and express them without worrying that their parents won\u2019t love them anymore.  Kids do NOT get to take their anger out on ANYONE else; that needs to be ingrained in them early and often so that respect and self control become innate behaviors for them.",

Your wife saying \"I am sorry I am not enough, I can't meet you're expectations \" sounds like some guilt trip crap. \nWhat are *her* expectations for how a 9 year old should be acting? \n\nThere need to be some consequences for the kid or else it's going to keep up. Trying to gentle parent this and saying \"we don't like it when you speak like that, it hurts our feelings \", is only telling the kid that her verbal abuse is working, and reinforcing her to keep doing it. \n\nThey probably need some therapy to figure out why kid is acting this way, and why mom is tolerating it.",
