      "selftext": "#asd\n#autism\n#adhd\n#unmasking\nI am a 22 year adult living with my 29 year old brother, 68 year old mom and 73 year old dad (in my country it is normal for child to live with parents even until 34 or so) about a year and two months ago, i learned about ADHD and Autism and i almost immediately realized how close it was to my experience, after five months of research, i decided to think of myself as autistic and a bit later ADHD (self diagnosis) \n\nSoon after, i came back home (from collage dorm) and was eager to hear about stories about my childhood that would further reassure me (to calm down imposter symptom) and when hearing them, i heard about a behavior that was autistic in my brother's childhood, given how both of these are highly genetic, i thought about my family and after three months, i came to conclusion that my brother is definitely asd and adhd, my mom and dad is adhd and probably autistic too. I was planning on gathering their idea about autism and adhd over time and after a month (but not much info really) i was feeling confident that they'll be supportive, i wanted to tell my family about everything when we were talking about autism (ourr janitor's autistic daughter) when out of nowhere, my mom said quote on quote:\" it's unfortunate, at least crazy people are better than autistics, because they sometimes have some sense of control over themselves, autistics are just brain dead!\" i wanted to argue back but instead i shrunk into myself, ended the conversation and went to my room and never spoke to them about autism or adhd ever again. \n\nThree months ago, my brother kinda changed his job (from teaching to school office) & doing this, his job just became a lot more draining, he is also working on his master's dgree and he is struggling a lot with time management and i'm worried if he keep on doing this for long, he might get to the burnout stage, on one hand i know how invaluable a diagnosis he believes can be for getting through a the hard time and my mom's side comments (which are thing comung from ADHD and autism) on the lther hand, i'm worried about him getting defensive and believing the same thing as my mom, because that would not only be frustrating, bit it could also be the last straw for him.\n AITAH for not telling him about his diagnosis and what should i do to tell him",

One might be to break the assignment down into 5-10 minute pieces, and just accomplish one at a time, with a stand up and walk around break in between. Another might be to use a day planner, or post-it notes, to remind himself of what needs to be done in the next hour, or day.\n\nIf you notice that his living space is messy, and he struggles to keep his belongings tidy, teach him the  phrase, \"Don't put it down, put it away.\" He can repeat this to himself 50 times a day if he wants, to be a consistent positive reinforcement of an easier way to live that results in never creating a pile of stuff to be put away later.\n\nIt is only helpful to hear a diagnosis of ADHD, Autism, or Spectrum Disorder, if the person is open to learning adaptive strategies to better live in the world. If a sibling or parent, or even you, attaches too much importance to a diagnosis name, to the point where it becomes your primary defining characteristic, then the diagnosis is not serving anyone. It is a label, and a stigma, and does not lead to understanding one's self or others.",
