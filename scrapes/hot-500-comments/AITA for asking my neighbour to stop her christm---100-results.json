      "selftext": "My 9 year old son suffers from severe epilepsy, and flashing lights often trigger him into seizure. It\u2019s usually really hard around christmas time because everybody\u2019s house has flashing lights, but our street is small and a tightly knit community so everyone has come together to make suitable adjustments i.e lights that stay solid/fading rather than flashing/dim settings etc. My family has been super grateful and it has made things so much easier for us during December. Recently we had a new neighbour move in right on the corner of the street, meaning her house front is in direct view of the rest of the street. She recently put up an abnormally large amount of lights and light up decorations that, while pretty, flash a lot and stay on during the day. My son has to walk down the street to his school, and usually we let him go alone or with a buddy, but the other day one of the neighbours caught him as he had a seizure because of the neighbours lights. I won\u2019t go into detail, but the neighbour did come out to help. My son is thankfully well now, and I went to speak to my neighbour the next day to talk about the incident and ask if there was any way she could turn down the intensity of the flashing and/or turn off the lights during the day. This way my son would not be exposed to the flashing because he is usually at home after dark, and the lights can still be on and beautiful at night. Plus, it\u2019s kind of pointless to have lights on during the day. My neighbour seemed a little down at having been told to turn it off, but mostly seemed okay with it. The first day she kept it off, but by the second day the lights were on again. I thought maybe she had just forgot, so I went to ask her a second time and maybe remind her before my son left, but she said that after keeping them off for one day her house just didn\u2019t look right so she turned them on again. Then she suggested that maybe I just drive my son the other way down the street to school (which would add ten minutes onto his journey, and also impossible because my husband and I both work). My whole street has found out and they are split so I\u2019m wondering AITA?\n\nEdit/update: People seem to have gotten confused by the 10 minutes bit. It would add ten minutes for driving, maybe an extra half an hour if my son was to walk. His school starts at 9:30 and the gates only open at 9. My husband leaves for work at 8, and I work from home with a major online meeting every morning at 9 which is why I say it\u2019s impossible.\n\nA lot of people suggested councils; not much in our area that would care too much. Also light timers were a good idea except when I say she has a lot of lights up I mean probably eight or nine different outlets.\n\nA few hours ago the mother of one of my son\u2019s friends came to visit and offered to drive my son to school for the next few weeks which I greatly appreciated and agreed to. We live in a semi regional area of Australia so there\u2019s only two or so weeks of school left until February (I assume the lights will be gone by then haha). Thanks for all the support!\n",
