      "selftext": "I\u2018ve debated on and off about ever coming to reddit for advice but I\u2018ve finally found myself at my wits end, I need help. Me and my girlfriend who we\u2018ll call May have been together for three years and some change now and there have been many ups and downs about our relationship. For a little while it was about age gap and maturity, but every time we sat snd talked things out she would always reassure me that she was prepared for anything to come. As some context to the question, May had graduated high school within our first year of dating. No, I did not start dating her when she turned 18. we got together when she had turned 19, but her younger cousin introduced us before her 19th birthday. May\u2018s family which at the time consisted of her youngest brother, her mother, and her mother\u2018s boyfriend, were all a handful and I never knew the magnitude until present day. Her mother has undiagnosed bipolar disorder (I have a bit of knowledge in the field of Psychology while both my brother and mom have their bachelor\u2019s and so on.) with a hint of raging narcissism. Her mom\u2018s boyfriend is a muscleman who only sticks to work, college or college/pro sports games. Not to mention they are both in their mid 40s. The younger brother is now in his double digits but at the time he was still in the singles and had a wide range of authority issues such as following instructions as shown, paying attention when he\u2018s needed or even listening to someone while they\u2018re talking to him, all of which was accepted behavior. Now that that is a little explained, we\u2018ll get to it. May\u2018s mom has been almost a bully to her since I moved into their area be closer to her and live with my brother and that has grown to be much worse. When they were leaving for Florida, May\u2018s mom didn\u2019t give her an option to leave or stay and made the decision for her to stay and move in with me. Mind you, this is right after May graduated high school. I asked May constantly if she was alright with living with me and was ready to jump head first into the work world, and her only answer was yes every time. Fast forward 3 years to today, May and made the plan to order breakfast, cuddle and watch Netflix when her mom called. As usual, May will answer the call and talk about at least ten different topics before the conversation is over which lasts about 45 minutes on average. Today however, her mother called with drama and bad news regarding the you gest brother. He\u2018s fine, but it just underlines my own moral issues with her mother. The topics they touched on plucked at a few nerves almost instantly so I blocked it all out with my earbuds, took a shower and even ate my breakfast while waiting. By the time May had finished her call with her mom, she could already tell my mood had been ruined but we managed to salvage the last hour I had before work to cuddle. Then the question comes. May started by easing her way into the question with starting it off by mentioning just how many things I have in common with her little brother. Gaming is a big hobby of mine and her little brother\u2018s as well, so we clicked with little to no problems. She then went into how I could be a great mentor for him which then caught my suspicion, but I let her finish. When she finally delivered the question, it almost felt like a repeat of the start of our relationship. She wanted me to be the absent guidance her little brother needs to be on the right track in life. A little more into the conversation and may admitted that I had essentially saved her from her parents house when I came along. I asked what she mentioned by that but also telling her to stop while she was ahead. I agreed to being a mentor for her little brother, but she continued anyway with how I got her away from the craziness and disorganized lifestyle. She said she doesn\u2019t want to say it in the bad way or any negative way, but 30% of our relationship was about her finding her ticket out of her previous life with her family, while the other 70% was her falling in love. I couldn\u2019t strum any words about how it made me feel to hear her say that out loud. I\u2018ve always had a feeling that was the case, but she had always begged to differ when I asked her if that\u2018s what the case was. I had a big plan for her Birthday tomorrow but now that I finally hear her say it, I\u2018m not sure how to feel. I\u2018m here at work with my mind all over the place, did she really fall in love from the beginning, or was it all planned. Was I just used as a getaway plan and if so, should I call off the relationship? \n\nTLDR: I (25 M) was just told by my (22 F) girlfriend that I could save her younger brother like I did with her as an exit plan from family drama.
