      "selftext": "SO and I have two weddings on the same day next year. They are both out of state and include lifelong friends getting married. SO is in one of the weddings. They already RSVP'd yes to the wedding for both of us even though I don't remember saying I could make it. I haven't RSVP'd to my wedding yet because the talks we had about it never came to a conclusion on what we were going to do.\n\nI brought it back up again today because my friend wants to know if I am able to make it, and when I suggested going to each of the weddings separately things escalated. SO wants us to go together to their friend's wedding and is hurt that I won't be there with them. I don't think it is that big of a deal to be at separate weddings for a weekend. I'd like to go to both but clearly cannot, so I'd rather go to my friends. When SO pressed me about my decision I conveyed to them that I was firm in going to my friends. AITAH?",
