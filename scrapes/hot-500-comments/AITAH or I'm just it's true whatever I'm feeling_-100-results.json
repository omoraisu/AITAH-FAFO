      "selftext": "I don't know what is wrong.\nI don't know what's with the people around me.\nI know going out is not safe, I know getting distracted and ignoring career is not an option but if I can't take my own decision then what's the point of even getting a degree? What's the point of making me self-reliant? We don't have that much money as much I and my sister think we do,but we have money to buy plots and built houses even though we already have three. We barely travel because dad doesn't like to travel. But how does dad ends up travelling with his friends always? Is this counted as traveling? Mom is frustrated because she is hating staying at home and always doing house chores, when will she understand we are feeling suffocated between these four walls too? Am I asking for too much freedom or its just my basic rights I'm demanding for? I always make myself understand that this is nothing people are way more miserable than this, but do I just ignore the importance of my issues too just the way my parents do? I completely hated taking science after 10th knowing that's it's never my cup of tea, but my parents had some out of this world delusion about me acing science. When my career is ruined from the roots then to taste which fruits of the tree I'm watering it? Is it normal? Is having a life like this normal? Or yet again I'm too influenced by the social media and think my life is downhill?\n\n\nTLDR; This is my first time writing a post please bear with me. And i truly I need advice on this.",
