      "selftext": "I am in desperate need of a second opinion regarding recent events with my GF. Note that this is a really long post. I really need help though - your input is going to have an indirect impact on my life. All that I have is my own perspective I don\u2019t trust it. I\u2019m trying to figure out if there as an objective way to determine if someone is toxic. We have been dating for 2 years - we met eachother at the end of our freshman year in ollege and undoubtedly experienced love. We did not spend a day apart for over 4 months, despite living an hour away from each other. The memories I have with her bring tears to my eyes when I think of where we are today. Today, we argue at least daily. It feels like there is so much hidden spite. We live together, unofficially. This is just a little background info to give you guys a little more context. \n\nYesterday was her 21st birthday party - note that her actual birthday is today. I spent a lot of time planning it. I messaged all of her friends individually. Told them time and place, what to expect. I got all necessary items for the party. Tables, cups, drinks, poker table/chips (at her request), etc. I probably spent $1000 collectively on this birthday, presents included. She helped with the decorations, at my request. I\u2019m not an artistic guy and am terrible at decorating - she knows this. We spent half of yesterday afternoon arguing while getting decorations set up. It was not a pleasant experience for either of us. She doesn\u2019t like when I question her methods or something doesn\u2019t go her way. I invited her friend over to help in hopes that it would cheer her up. It did. While her friend was there, it was a golden time. Not even 5 minutes after her friend left, we started arguing again. Anyways - once the party started it was once again a golden time. We had a great night, I thought. The next morning we wake up, and we go pick up drinks from Starbucks and breakfast from a local diner. We go home and eat these. I had an important phone call at 11 that I had told her about 3 days before. After the call, things started going downhill. I have an end of semester group project that is notoriously strenuous and difficult. I told her that I had to meet with my group today and explained that peer feedback is a heavy percentage of our grade. Yesterday, I had made her aware that there is a possibility of me meeting with my group on her birthday but that I would try to get out of it. \n\nMy gf is a big eagles fan and had told me that she wanted to watch the game today. She became upset that I was going to meet with my group. I made up an excuse to my group and told them I couldn\u2019t get there until 3 so I could watch the first half with her. This is a text I wrote to her after she said that all she wanted to do was watch the eagles game with me. \n\n\u201cYeah XXXXXXX i understand your frustration. But I don\u2019t think you understand the position I am in. As much as I wish \u201cI\u2019m watching the eagles game with my gf bc it\u2019s her birthday\u201d was a valid excuse it really doesn\u2019t cut it. I have to choose between failing on a project or spending time with my gf on her birthday. I gave you all of my time yesterday. \n\nI feel pretty unappreciated - I\u2019m just realizing how much I spoil you only to feel like I\u2019m getting treated like shit. There is no gratitude. I tried to put myself in your shoes - I wouldve told you to get what you needed done bc u did so much for me already. Then maybe make plans to eat out in the evening. You just get angry at me.\u201d\n\nThe 2nd paragraph is not something that I have addressed, and I really don\u2019t know how to explain myself it\u2019s just the way I feel. I felt unappreciated. I didn\u2019t think she was thankful for all that I had done to try and make her birthday special. The reason why exactly? That remains a mystery to me. I wish I knew because then I could address it. I think it\u2019s because when I told her I had to meet with my group she got angry with me. She wanted more from me but didn\u2019t even realize how much I had given her the day before. I felt like what I had done the day before justified my decision to go with the group basically.  \n\nI followed up with this paragraph \u201cBut yeah if you disagree strongly with my 2nd paragraph then we need to talk. Your friends showed more gratitude to me for helping plan your birthday party than you did. It feels like you just disregarded all the presents I got you. I put a lot of time and thought into it and although the surprise part of it got spoiled, I still did this for you. I can\u2019t make you happy. I\u2019m tired of getting walked on. I literally do anything you tell me and dont say no. I get everything for you. Anything you ask for. And then you just turn around and pretend like I don\u2019t exist.\u201d\n\nThe bottom part of the paragraph is true. But the thing is, Im fairly certain I don\u2019t do these things out of love - I do it because I feel like saying no isn\u2019t an option. She always asks for things and is very very picky. But when she wants something, I will get it for her. I rarely say no. For example, randomly she will have a craving - \u201cI want sweet tea.\u201d I\u2019ll ask her where from and then go get it, usually with her. It feels like I can\u2019t say no to these things - would a caring boyfriend deny their loved one\u2019s desires? Where do I draw the line? \n\nAnyways. She respond to this paragraph with 4 different texts. \n\u201cOkay\u201d\n\u201cBreak up with me on my birthday already\u201d\n\u201cMade it to 21\u201d\n\u201cNow I can die\u201d\n\u201cEveryone hates me anyways\u201d\n\nI respond:\n\n\u201cYeah that\u2019s not gonna help\u201d\n\u201cIf you want to have a mature conversation we can\u201d\n\u201cIf not then it\u2019s better not to talk. I\u2019d prefer to have a real adult conversation.\u201d\n\u201cI told you how I feel, and you turn it into a guilt trip\u201d\n\nShe responds:\n\n\u201cNo\u201d\n\u201cI\u2019m just tired\u201d\n\u201cI gave up my whole life for you\u201d\n\u201cI dropped everything freshman year to be with you and commit to you\u201d\n\u201cIf you feel this way then leave me. There\u2019s no need for a \u201creal adult conversation\u201d because neither of us can communicate with each other. You either want to be done or don\u2019t and it really sounds like you want to be done. No guilt tripping here, just truth.\u201d\n\nFrom here it just goes into nothing just pointless bickering. I don\u2019t know what to think of this situation. There are many instances like this. I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m in the wrong, or if she is. Am I a toxic person? Is she? I just want what\u2019s best for both of us. I love her and have done a lot to try and make this work. The memories we have together are what are holding us together, I think. I know this was REALLY long. But please someone I am need of advice. ",
