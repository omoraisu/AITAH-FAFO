      "selftext": "Before anything, English is not my first language. So I apologise in advance if this is a hard read, but please beware with me. \n\nSo, I (24F) and one of my best friends, let\u2019s call her Carol (23F), have been in each other\u2019s lives for about 12 years now. We went to the same school and always ended up in the same class. She knows everything about me, and I knew everything about her. We helped each other as much as two dumb teenagers with strict parents could.\n\nOne thing worth mentioning is that my parents are separated. At the time, I was living with my dad and my stepmother. I won\u2019t get too much into detail, but she used to beat me and make me work in her restaurant for 10 hours a day on weekends and holidays. That was one of the main reasons I left. When I turned 18, I ran away from home and moved to another country where I have some family from my mother\u2019s side. (Before you ask, there are separate reasons why my mom didn\u2019t get involved in this situation.)\n\nI went back home to visit family in 2022 for two weeks and let Carol know months in advance, in case she could also come back from university. At the time, she told me she couldn\u2019t, so my aunt said she would take me to Carol\u2019s place and pick me up a couple of days later (a 2 hour drive each way).\nI don\u2019t drive, as the city I live in now has great public transport, so getting a car would be a waste of money.\n\nFast forward to my holidays. I get to my aunt\u2019s place, and everything goes well until my uncle has to go to the hospital for breathing difficulties. He ends up staying there the whole time I\u2019m visiting. Obviously, I tell my aunt she doesn\u2019t need to take me to Carol\u2019s because I\u2019ll stay with her instead.\n\nNow, you need to understand that my aunt is like a mother to me. She cares about me and looks after me like I\u2019m her own child. She just retired recently, and until then, she was working in another country. Every time she came home, I was the first person she\u2019d visit. She\u2019s done more for me than either of my parents. (Also, my auntie has a son but he lives in another county, the same where she was working and living before retiring). \n\nSeeing her so worried and anxious, I just couldn\u2019t leave her. I called Carol and explained the situation. She was a bit annoyed but understood.\n\nI thought that was the end of it. We continued FaceTiming and messaging as usual, and everything seemed fine.\n\nUntil this year. Carol told me she was coming on a week-long holiday with her boyfriend and his mom to the country where I live. It\u2019s been nearly five years since we last saw each other.\n\nI asked her to leave one evening free so I could pick her up, take her to dinner, and then drop her back at the hotel. I even told her I wouldn\u2019t mind if her boyfriend and his mom joined us, I just didn\u2019t want to intrude on their family time. I was fine with anything.\n\nAfter a few days, she called to say that after talking with her boyfriend and checking their schedule, she wouldn\u2019t have time to meet me. When I suggested tagging along for whatever they were doing, she said it might be too awkward with his mom.\n\nI was pissed. What do you mean you can\u2019t take a couple of hours to see me? But I just said, \u201cOkay,\u201d and sent her my work address, suggesting she could visit me while I was bartending in a touristy area. That way, they could sightsee, and I could still see her.\n\nShe went back home, and we didn\u2019t end up meeting.\n\nAfter that, I didn\u2019t message her for a few days, and she didn\u2019t reach out either. But when I talked to my cousin, she said, \u201cDon\u2019t act like a child; just talk to her.\u201d She was right, I was being immature. So I messaged Carol and asked when she was free to talk.\n\nShe explained that the trip was paid for by her boyfriend\u2019s mom, and she didn\u2019t want to make her uncomfortable by bringing me along when we\u2019d never met. After that, everything went back to normal with us FaceTiming, messaging and checking in on each other.\n\nThen, out of nowhere, Carol stopped replying to my messages. At first, I thought she was busy with uni work and didn\u2019t want to bother her. But days turned into weeks, so I sent her a \u201cHey, you okay?\u201d message. She said she\u2019d been really busy but would call me when she had a break.\n\nShe never did.\n\nMaybe this is where I\u2019m the asshole, but I felt betrayed. She was always out with friends, posting about all the fun she was having on Instagram, but she couldn\u2019t call me back? So I stopped messaging her to see how long it would take for her to remember my existence.\n\nMy birthday came and went without a message from her. I thought maybe she\u2019d forgotten, but then she posted a birthday shoutout for someone else that same day.\n\nIs it childish if I decide not to message her on her birthday at the end of the month?\n\nI know this probably sounds like some teenage drama, but I just need some outside view on this. Some of my friends say that I\u2019m in the right while others say \u201cit\u2019s not that deep\u201d. \n\nBut yeah, thank you for taking some of your time to read this and potentially helping out. \n",
