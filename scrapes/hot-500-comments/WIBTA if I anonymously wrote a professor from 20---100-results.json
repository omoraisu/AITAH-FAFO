      "selftext": "I\u2019ve often wondered if the twenty-year mark might be the right time to send a letter to my former professor, expressing how her actions impacted me and others as young students. I want to explain how her behavior, both what she did and failed to do, left lasting effects.\n\nTo provide context: this professor taught small, selective art classes at a university, with 5-10 students. Most of us entered with idealistic dreams of pursuing our art, but by the end of the course, she had dissuaded several talented students from continuing, even as a hobby. Her cruelty was not constructive; she mocked and belittled those she decided she disliked, targeting the most vulnerable and making the classroom a place of fear. I remember feeling physically ill with anxiety before class. Meanwhile, her favorites received constant praise, creating a dynamic of emotional dependence where they worshiped her approval, while the rest of us were left terrified.\n\nAfter being fired from that position, she led another program, only to be fired from that as well. I\u2019m not sure what happened to her after that, though I know she\u2019s been in a stable position for a few years now. I\u2019ve often wondered what was going on in her life at the time. I don\u2019t believe she was a fundamentally bad person. There are people who speak highly of her, especially regarding her advocacy work. Perhaps that\u2019s why I still feel it\u2019s important to tell her how her behavior had a profound, negative impact on some of her students. If she is in a better place now, hearing this directly from a former student might offer her an opportunity to reflect on that period of her life, either privately or publicly.\n\nHowever, I question if it\u2019s my place to bring this up. I was one of the few who recognized the toxicity of the classroom dynamic, went on to graduate school with a full scholarship, and had my art professionally recognized. I rarely think of her now, except in moments of reflection about the kind of behaviors I want to avoid. But still, I feel it\u2019s important for her to understand the lasting effect her actions had on us. Enough so that I am writing this.\n\nWIBTA if a sent an anonymous letter?",
