      "selftext": "Okay, I\u2019m 19F and live alone with my Stepdad, who I\u2019ll refer to shorthand as SD, who\u2019s 58M. He\u2019s great most of the time, and has continued to look after me and provide for me after my mothers passing.\n\nI\u2019ve been really sick the last five weeks or so, and I\u2019ve been back and forth the doctors every week trying to figure out what\u2019s going on and trying to get help. \nLast Friday I had an appt at the optometrists to see if they would turn up any results after some issues I\u2019d had with my eyes I thought may or may not be related to the sickness.\n\nSD said he would take me down to the optometrist, go get his hair cut while I was being tested, and then pick me up and drive us home.\nThis has been done before when I have an appt in town, he\u2019ll often go do an errand or get his hair done in a shop in the same town.\n\nBecause of this, I didn\u2019t bring my house keys because I obviously thought we would be returning home together.\n\nCue us heading down to town, he asks if I\u2019ll walk home if I\u2019m done before he\u2019s done in the hairdressers (which confused me, since he\u2019s often very quick in and out.)\nI replied that I didn\u2019t bring my keys and that I\u2019ll just wait in a cafe if he is done before me, no problem.\n\nHe gets irritated and asks why I didn\u2019t bring my keys, then doesn\u2019t let me answer, suggesting that once I finish my test I catch a bus to a hairdressers he\u2019s going do which is about 10-15 minutes away. Which again, confused me. In the past he\u2019s always used the hairdressers in town.\n\nI reply, and I\u2019m positive my tone was normal and neutral and had no attitude, that I would rather not  jump around different places needlessly, especially since I only expected to go to one place today and I\u2019ve been feeling constantly exhausted with this sickness- which he knows.\n\nHe erupts, starts loudly talking about how I\u2019m stressing him out and such a bother and that he\u2019s been constantly trying to work around me lately and that he\u2019s so done with it. He then parks, gives me his house keys, and tells me to walk home when I\u2019m done (home isn\u2019t very far from town, just up a large hill.)\n\n\nIt left me confused and hurt and a bit angry. I thought we\u2019d had a really good week despite my sickness. There had been no arguments, we had gone out to eat takeaway in the car a few nights ago. And I\u2019m positive that I hadn\u2019t spoken in a snappy way. \nI know he\u2019s stressed, I know me being sick has caused him a lot of trouble, and I know I\u2019m a bother to him right now. It just really hurt my feelings.\n\nI get tested, he\u2019s done before I am, he takes us home and acts like nothing happened. He goes away for the weekend on a pre planned trip.\n\nHe came back today, we hang out for a bit, then I ask to talk. I say flat out that I don\u2019t want to argue, I just want to talk about it since it had been really bothering me all weekend.\n\nWhy was he so mean? Why did he erupt at me like that when we\u2019d had a pretty peaceful week and I hadn\u2019t done anything to provoke him? \nHe starts spewing about how it had just all built up and he\u2019d been doing so much for me, that I just need to get better and snap out of it, that he was stressed and needed me to be normal again.\n\nI feel kind of blank in the convo, and I\u2019m surprisingly really calm when I reply.\nI mention that I just want a bit of an apology since it was so out of nowhere, that I understand that he\u2019s stressed but it just hurt my feelings and I just want to know he feels at least a little bad about it. I mention that Everytime I snap because I\u2019ve had an overwhelming week or month or so on, I always, always, without fail apologise him- whether minutes or hours later. I\u2019ll always say \u2018sorry I was just irritated and didn\u2019t mean to be so mean.\u2019 This doesn\u2019t happen much, but I always make sure to say sorry when it does happen.\n\nSo I say, why can\u2019t you just do the same? A quick \u2018sorry I was stressed and just snapped, I didn\u2019t mean to be so harsh\u2019\n\nHe doesn\u2019t get it. He thinks he was right and justified in shouting at me, that everything had built up and it just happened. \nI understand the build up, but isn\u2019t that more reason to apologise? Because it was just a snap of a moment thing when stressed? \n\nHe said he\u2019s \u2019sorry I feel like I need an apology\u2019 and that he\u2019ll \u2019apologise if I really want him to\u2019\n\nBut it makes me realise he doesn\u2019t want to or see why he should apologise, and that hurts because it means he really, really feels like I deserved to be yelled at like that.\n\nI\u2019m just really upset and confused.\nAm I overthinking this? Was I the asshole? I think I just need someone else\u2019s perspective.\n\nSorry this is so long.",
