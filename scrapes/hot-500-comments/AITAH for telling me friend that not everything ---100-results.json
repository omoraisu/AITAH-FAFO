      "selftext": "I, 15F and my friend, Max, 15M have been friends for a couple of years now. Both of us are part of a large friend group, which means we are mostly together all the time. He has this kind of personality where as everything has to be about him. I didnt mind it at first because I thought that it wasn't a big deal. One day we were all together and one of our friend, Emily 15F mentioned that her grandma passed away and was really sad. We were all comforting her because well, dealing with the loss of a loved one is really hard. For some reason Max looked really annoyed and agitated and didn't comfort her at all. While my friend was telling us how her grandma made the best pasta and how she would not be able to taste it ever again, Max suddenly shot up and told us that his dog died. Mind you, Max dosent have a dog. He dosent even have any pets. Suddenly all of our friends turned from Emily and suddenly started comforting Max because apparently losing a dog is more sadder then losing a grandma. I was really confused and shocked because we were literally just comforting Emily and didn't even let her finish what she was saying. Max was crying fake crocodile tears and everyone was so sad for him. I decided to say something and said that we were literally just comforting Emily and she wasn't even finished talking. By this time Emily was still crying and I was still holding her. After I said this, Max snapped at me and told me I don't understand how he feels. I told him he dosent even have a dog and not everything has to be about him and called him an attention seeker. Now all of our friends are calling me heartless, rude and stuck up. Max dosent want to speak to Ms. AITAH?",
