      "selftext": "My (37F) husband (39M) and I have been married for 8 years. We\u2019ve always had a pretty good relationship, but we come from different religious backgrounds. I was raised in a secular household, while he comes from a Christian family. We agreed early in our relationship that spirituality was something we could discuss openly without it impacting our relationship. I respected his beliefs, and he respected my lack thereof, and we built a life together based on love, honesty, and mutual support.\n\nRecently, however, he began attending church with a couple of his friends, and I didn\u2019t think much of it at first; it seemed like a phase. But then he started changing. He became more fervent in his beliefs, and I\u2019ve noticed he\u2019s started pushing those ideas onto me. He constantly talks about his \u201cfaith journey\u201d and tries to engage me in discussions about the Bible and prayer, which I find uncomfortable. \n\nI\u2019ve tried to support him while maintaining my own views, but the more he dives into this, the more it feels like he's trying to convert me. He even suggested that we should raise future children in the church, which I vehemently opposed. I feel like a stranger in my own home, and our discussions often end in arguments. It\u2019s creating a rift between us that I\u2019m not sure can be repaired.\n\nI spoke to him about how I felt. I told him that while I respect his beliefs, I can\u2019t be part of a life that revolves around religion, especially one I don\u2019t believe in. His response was that he feels called to share the love of Christ with me, and he can\u2019t understand why I wouldn\u2019t want to explore this with him. This conversation ended up with both of us hurt and frustrated.\n\nNow, I\u2019m at a point where I\u2019m seriously considering divorce. I feel like I\u2019m losing the person I married, and I\u2019m scared of where this is heading. It feels like we\u2019re on two different paths, and the more he immerses himself in Christianity, the more I feel I\u2019ll have to suppress who I am and what I believe. \n\nI know divorce is a big step, and I don\u2019t want to be hasty, but I\u2019m also trying to look out for my own well-being. A part of me feels guilty for wanting to end it over his faith, but I can\u2019t shake the feeling that this is driving a wedge between us that might be impossible to fix.",

There&#39;s a huge difference in fresh water and salt water fish, so was their an aquarium on the ark to put all the different species of freshwater fish?.  Then how did landlocked animals find their way to the ark? </p>\n\n<p>Then there was this Heaven being on or in the Clouds somewhere over Earth. Well if that were true with our modern science and technology, should we not be able to see Heaven from space and fly aircraft to it?   Since a chariot or fire took Elijah to Heaven it  means it&#39;s not just in the spiritual realm but in our reality, so we should be able to see and find it.   Unless it&#39;s been Aliens the entire time and the Chariot was an Alien Spaceship.</p>\n</div>",

I also slightly resent thanking God for my sobriety. If I have to claim & atone for all my stupendous drunken fuckups,  I want to be able to claim my 11 years sobriety too. It's one of the few things I'm proud of achieving. I attend church. I try to be the best version of myself (and fail at this daily). If other people don't want to believe in what they see as a fairy tale about an old man in the sky, I get that! And I 100% respect it. Just as I resent anyone attempting to talk me *out* of my religion. I don't want *anyone's* belief system, or lack thereof, shoved down my throat. So I won't do it to others. And I get people not trusting us - we have over 2000 years history of literally forcing our beliefs on others. With torture, death & genocide the alternative. It's time we stopped. I don't have any answers. I know what I believe. I don't need to make others kowtow to my beliefs to prove my faith. I want to be the best version of myself *in addition* to my faith. I want to volunteer at a foodbank because it's a decent thing to do and society sucks. Not to win a \"goodness\" prize. I quit drinking because I wanted to stop hurting the ones I love. I'm not spiritually enlightened. It's pretty much a guessing game! If i'm right, great. If i'm wrong, well, it gave me good friends within a caring community. I'm no worse off.

Especially to Christianity! I also slightly resent thanking God for my sobriety. If I have to claim &amp; atone for all my stupendous drunken fuckups,  I want to be able to claim my 11 years sobriety too. It&#39;s one of the few things I&#39;m proud of achieving. I attend church. I try to be the best version of myself (and fail at this daily). If other people don&#39;t want to believe in what they see as a fairy tale about an old man in the sky, I get that! And I 100% respect it. Just as I resent anyone attempting to talk me <em>out</em> of my religion. I don&#39;t want <em>anyone&#39;s</em> belief system, or lack thereof, shoved down my throat. So I won&#39;t do it to others. And I get people not trusting us - we have over 2000 years history of literally forcing our beliefs on others. With torture, death &amp; genocide the alternative. It&#39;s time we stopped. I don&#39;t have any answers. I know what I believe. I don&#39;t need to make others kowtow to my beliefs to prove my faith.
