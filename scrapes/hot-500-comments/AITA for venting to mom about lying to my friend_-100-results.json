      "selftext": "First of all, I want to say I\u2019m new in this subreddit and apologize if I make a mistake in formatting this post or if my English is off (I am not a native speaker), but I need feedback on how to deal with this.\n\nI\u2019m in a friend group of 6 people (\u201cA \u2013 me\u201d, \u201cB\u201d, \u201cC\u201d, \u201cD\u201d, \u201cE\u201d and \u201cF\u201d). We all met in college, and we try to see each other once a month. Since finishing college and getting jobs, for the past 4 years, \u201cC\u201d and \u201cD\u201d have always relied on car rides from me and \u201cB\u201d. Info: C has her own car and D lives in a place that has an excellent public transportation system.\n\nIt started out with me and \u201cB\u201d being fine with it, especially because both of us love driving, but after a while we just got tired and frustrated from always driving them. It\u2019s always the same: Picking them up from their houses (usually making a BIG detour), being stuck in traffic, arriving at the restaurant (in the center of the city, where parking is expensive and there are very few parking spaces) and then having to take them home at the end of the night (so we are always the designated drivers). Both me and \u201cB\u201d have tried talking to them, giving hints, it got to the point of not responding to them, but the outcome is always the same: they say we need plan theses rides so we don\u2019t all take the our cars, ending with me and \u201cB\u201d always giving free rides (they never paid parking or gas).\n\nNow to issue at hands: I got so tired and frustrated that I started embellishing the truth, so I do not have to give rides. An example: when asked for a free ride (they always ask at the last minute), I would say I have another engagement prior so I can\u2019t give any rides. If they asked where I was going, I would just say it\u2019s a family thing. Recently I was with \u201cE\u201d and was venting on my phone with my mom about this whole situation, how I just lied to not give free rides. Suddenly \u201cE\u201d started looking at my phone and I think she SAW THE WHOLE CONVERSTION. \u201cE\u201d said she was just looking for the time on my phone, but she actively stared for various seconds, so I know she saw something but do not know how much. \u00a0Since then, \u201cE\u201d has been acting weird around me and I feel like an awful person, so I have to ask: AITA for this whole situation?",
