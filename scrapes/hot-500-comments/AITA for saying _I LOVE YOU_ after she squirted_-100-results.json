      "selftext": "I ( M41) had a massive crush back in high school ( Dannie F46). She is the sister of another kid in school. I was maybe 15 at the time. Throughout the years, I saw her occasionally and thought she gave off goddess vibes. I didn't see her in years until she walked into my office. I finally learned more about her. The service she was looking for was best suited for another colleague, so I pointed her in the right direction. Age looks beautiful on her. I spent months hoping to hear back from her, until we ran into each other at the supermarket. We built a good friendship after that. I was surprised to hear that she had an abusive marriage. She's a mom and was very single. Our friendship is nothing I've experienced before. She's not afraid to be goofy or laughing hard. She doesn't run away if I show up and her hair is not \u201cdone\u201d. Honestly, I'm grateful and appreciate being able to get to know her as a person rather than the \u201csmall town celebrity\u201d that I had in my head.\n\nAbout 2 months ago, she started taking naps on my lap. I know this is extremely personal and requires trust. I don't make moves unless I'm invited because I would hate being rejected. So, what follows is a bit confusing.\n\nWe both have demanding careers and are parents, but we see each other at least 4 times a week and call each other everyday no matter what. I look forward to this and so does she ( her own words). We always do Friday night at a restaurant, and we don't clarify when people mistake us for a married couple. I'm proud to be with her and I admire her for having overcome very bad moments in life. \n\nLast Friday, we went out and ended up at my place. We shared a kiss and she was super nervous. I asked her if she wanted to stop but she said no and sat on my lap. One thing led to another and we ended up having sex. I had never seen a woman squirt ( she did a little). After we finished and were relaxing, I said that I loved her and she said she felt the same but started crying. She said she was gonna be okay but she looked teary eyed. \n\nWe've maintained the same rate of calls and texting, but I'm a bit worried. Did I fuck up by saying the L word? I think maybe she's embarrassed about the squirt? I'm coming here because I'd like to hear opinions and any advice to help her feel secure and comfortable. As background, Dannie has a history of abandonment. While pregnant, her ex-husband decided to go on a road trip and kept pushing his return date, then he cheated and married AP who's now in jail for fraud. She also has a history of men harassing her \u201cbecause she is pretty\u201d which caused her to be a little avoidant and to hate showing skin.\n\nAitah?\n\n\nEdit: for grammar.\n",
