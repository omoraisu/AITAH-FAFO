      "selftext": "Background is I'm in my late thirties. Came back from college and worked in the family business. \n\nWe're a retail / fast food ish business. Extremely seasonal. We are busy four months a year. We have about a dozen full and part time staff during the six-month busy season. \n\nDuring the off season I might have two-part timers. \n\nBefore COVID it was me, my dad, and my uncle working in the shop. There was always a member of the family in the shop. We could always monitor staff.\n\nMy mom worked in her home office doing staff scheduling and basic accounting. I do everything else. \n\nCOVID hits and I'm working in the shop alone with our mostly teenage and early twenty-year-old seasonal staff. Uncle and dad both retire and then die. My mom is still doing her scheduling and accounting work from home.\n\nI've been exhausted for the past five years. I work seven days a week but I'm not there from opening to closing. I know stuff happens when I'm not there. The business isn't running like it was when it was me, my uncle, and my dad but I'm trying my hardest. I've never worked this hard in my life. \n\nI think some of my staff think my mom owns the business and calls the shots. I think this is because she does the scheduling and signs the paychecks. The only contact they have with her is email and maybe a phone call. \n\nNo one outside of my mom knows I'm the owner and how I make all the decisions. I work right next to the staff. I try to be as modest and hard working as possible. I drive an old car. I don't try to act like the stereotypical jerk pompous boss. \n\nI hired this 18-year-old recently high school graduated guy. He seemed like a dopey kid. Finding and retaining help is a huge issue so I take what I can get. If I could have terminated him earlier, I would have. I just didn't have any staff. When it got busy, he did work. \n\nFirst big issue was this kid came to work smelling really bad. After a couple of shifts I had to take him aside and politely explain to him he needed to shower before work and wash his clothes. \n\nSecond big issue was he always came ten to fifteen minutes late. From what I understood he didn't have a license and took Ubers or his parents drove him. I didn't give him issues with it as he couldn't drive. I kept telling him numerous times politely to please come on time. He was good for a few months and then went back to coming a few minutes late. \n\nThen the guy couldn't stay off his phone. My rule is if customers are in the store, you can't use your phone. If you have to use your phone, do it discretely and when you don't have something to do.\n\nNonstop this guy couldn't stay off his phone. Constantly texting or scrolling on his phone. It was like he had a mental condition where he was compelled to be on his phone. Many times, customers are in the store standing a few feet away. \n\nI think I must have told him to a hundred times to get off his phone. He'd always say \"sorry\" put it away and then the next day he'd go back to using his phone. Or he'd have some excuse. \n\nThen he'd go to the bathroom a lot. I can't really tell staff they can't use the bathroom. I'm sure he went in there to use his phone. \n\nHe actually got better with phone usage after a few weeks, but it left a bad taste in my mouth. \n\nWhenever I'd tell him to get off his phone or come on time or correct him, he'd always have this smirk on his face like he was about to laugh at me. It seemed like he wasn't taking me seriously. \n\nIt turns out he was hooking up or dating a coworker. I didn't know. She was 16 and he's 18. I noticed if I called staff members together for an impromptu staff meeting and tell them something and they were both in attendance he'd make her laugh. I could have sworn he was making fun of me while I was talking. I never saw his face but it always seemed like she was looking at him and something always made her laugh or giggle. \n\nSeason ends. I don't think he had any idea how much I didn't like him. He asked me if he could work a bunch of hours off season. I would have given him hours, but I couldn't work with him, and I didn't really trust him. He seemed oblivious to how much he sucked.\n\nI gave him maybe five hours a week when I wasn't there, and a trusted employee was there with him. \n\nAbout two months ago I repeatedly found hair in food displays. I instituted a much tighter hair policy where anyone with longer hair had to either have it tied back or wear a hat to contain it. I told this guy he had to wear a hat as he had longer hair that wasn't tied back. I even bought him two hats to wear. I told him repeatedly he had to wear a hat while he worked. A few times he forgot a hat. Then sometimes he'd wear it and then when I left, he took it off. It seemed like he thought it was optional even though I must have told him a dozen times to put a hat on. I watched him on camera from home working without a hat after I left on probably a half a dozen occasions. \n\nI check the cameras last week when he's working and he's practically making out with this female coworker behind the counter. I'd never seen this before. She wasn't even on shift that day. He's also not wearing a hat after I told him \"you have to throw on a hat\" twenty minutes ago after he showed up not wearing a hat again.\n\nI get in my car and head to my shop. I walk in the front door. His \"GF\" sees me and runs out the back door. He heads to the back of the shop and I follow him. \n\nI told him I'd had enough and sent him home. He looked at me confused and then wanted to debate with me. He said he could be better, and he could work. I told him I didn't want to debate with him. I was tired of his behavior, and it was cumulative, and I just didn't want to deal with it. I brought up the hat issue as an example and he really didn't have anything to say. I told him when I told him to do something he needed to do it.\n\nThis summer I had repeated issues with another newly hired employees' attendance. I never yelled at him, but I told him very sternly he couldn't keep doing this. The guy constantly called out at the last minute. Then he needed to take a whole week off. I sent him home on his last day because he screwed the schedule up so much, I had someone to fill in for him. Apparently, he didn't like that, and he called my mom and complained about me. He told her he should be able to call out whenever he wanted, and it was my fault I didn't have someone to cover. He said I was mean and rude and unprofessional to him.",
