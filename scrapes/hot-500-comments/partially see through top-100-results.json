      "selftext": "i went to a music festival over the weekend and took some stuff that was stronger than normal (didn\u2019t realise until it started to hit), plus was sweating like crazy cause the weather was so fucked and both the indoor and outdoor venues were packed. my top was absolutely drenched in sweat (tmi) so i took it off, and was essentially in a mini skirt with a bra. the thing is my bra is partially see through, like there\u2019s lace on the top half, so you could see my nipples at certain points. i was out of it so i completely forgot,, lowk tbh idk if i would\u2019ve done it sober, maybe i would\u2019ve or maybe i wouldn\u2019t have. either way, my boyfriend expressed to me right after and then again today that he was rlly uncomfortable about this.\n\ntbh idk how to feel, i get he may be uncomfortable, but being uncomfortable about it enough for it to be actively bothering him for a while after?? was it rlly thay bad of me to do? he doesn\u2019t have trust issues as far as im aware. AITAH for wearing it? just need another opinion \ud83e\udef6\n\nhe later said he feels weird about me going to these types of events,, idk what to do or say, he isn\u2019t controlling or anything so it feels quite out of character ",
