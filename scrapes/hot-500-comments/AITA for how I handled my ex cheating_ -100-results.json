      "selftext": "I (29M) was engaged to my ex (26F). She is in grad school working on a Masters. We had a shared apartment, but in June, I got a great job about two hours away from her school in my hometown. I have since bought a house and she was supposed to move in at the beginning of January. The lease in the apartment we used to share ends at the end of this month. \n\nIn September, I started to notice her being distant with me. I thought nothing of it. There was a new guy in the program she started mentioning, I thought nothing of it. Well, a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving I got pretty irrefutable proof she was cheating with this guy.\n\nI was more angry than I can put into words. Originally, she was planning on coming to see me the weekend before Thanksgiving before she went home for the week. I made up some excuses for why she couldn't come, so I did not see her.\n\nWhile she was gone for Thanksgiving, I took what stuff I had of hers at the house, and took it to the apartment. I wrote a detailed letter about the cheating, how I felt, and letting her know I was breaking up with her. I also wrote her a check for my part of the rent for December, but told her she needs to make arrangements for the other things. I paid her car insurance, health insurance, and cell phone each month. I also went about changing passwords, locks, passcodes, etc., so she could not access anything of mine.\n\nShe got back to the apartment on November 30th and saw the letter. She lost it. She called repeatedly, I did not answer. In the early morning hours of December 1st, she showed up to the house trying to get in, she couldn't. My friends started calling me. I told them I was fine, but that I would not see or speak to her under any circumstances. I told them to ask her to leave. Eventually she did.\n\nI still have not spoken to her and don't plan to ever. Some of my friends are saying I am an AH. Apparently her account is overdrawn because I usually put money in her account at the beginning of the month to cover her bills, but since I didn't, money came out and caused her to have a negative balance. She has absolutely nowhere to stay once the lease ends at the end of the month. And she just wants to talk to me for closure. I refuse. They ask if I could at least give her some money to get her account balance back up, but I refuse.\n\nAITA? ",
