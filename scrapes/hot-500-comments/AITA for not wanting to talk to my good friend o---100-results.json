      "selftext": "Me and my really good friend have known each other for over a year now. We see each other everyday at school and talk the whole time. Recently I have been more tired due to mental health and not really up to talking to her because she loves to trauma dump me. I have told her all this face to face and on text as well. I have told her that I don\u2019t want to talk much during free time. Now she keeps giving me silent treatment and gets mad about everything. And when she does text me she says fake things to get my attention like \u201cI\u2019m in the hospital\u201d or something else, often really serious stuff and I get worried easily. I have told her to stop that but no use. \n\nAlso for context I have always been a antisocial and introverted person. I like to be alone on my own time. ",
