      "selftext": "I\u2019m a 23 (F) and my birthday is coming up in 2 weeks. I made plans to go see a hockey game since I haven\u2019t been to a game because of my work. My family is going and I told my parents that they can invite their friends as well. I have two brothers, one is 32 and the other is 28, who would possibly go. However, they both tend to ask to go home early whenever we do go even if my parents and I wanna stay until the end. \n\nMy issue is that my 28 year old brother has a 5 year old son. I told my dad about inviting them and he was hesitant because my nephew wouldn\u2019t be able to sit still. I told my mom that she can ask if they want to go but don\u2019t make them go if they don\u2019t want to. Now I\u2019m in a dilemma because I don\u2019t exactly want to invite them.\n\nMy nephew can\u2019t sit still. We just saw a movie recently and he was bouncing in his seat constantly. I understand he is a child and children can\u2019t sit still but he doesn\u2019t listen well. I know he won\u2019t listen to his parents and will just make things complicated. Last year birthday was rough and I just want a smooth night with no issues.\n\nI wanted to know if I would be an asshole if I tell my mom to have them not come to the game and just have them come over the next night for dinner?",
