It's not bad for wanting to have a nice birthday but it's all for the memories and spending good time, but don't feel forced to want nice photos instead of having fun. It seems a bit mean cursing you out for that tho rather than pointing why it was wrong. \n\nUnless you are asking for them to wear a specific type of outfit of the same colour like in a wedding, then YTA, you have to be a bit more flexible, can't be asking everyone to get a outfit for a birthday. It wouldn't be good spending all that money and food and things just for your not friends not to show up because you wanted a specific colour..",
