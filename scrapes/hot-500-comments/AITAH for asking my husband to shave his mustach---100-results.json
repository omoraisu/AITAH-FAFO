      "selftext": "I'm 38F, husband is 44m. We've been together for 19 years and have 2 young kids. When we met my husband had a job that he was required to be clean shaven. Over vacations he'd most always get a 5 o'clock shadow and a beard within a week or so (he grows a beard quickly). It was never an issue because he'd have to be clean shaven for work. I like the shadow and think he grows a great beard.  Fast forward to the last maybe 3 years- he switched careers and now works from home- so hasn't needed to be clean shaven. Three years ago it started slow- beard was definitely around and shaving sporadic. But things turned when he started shaving the beard but keeping a mustache. And I absolutely detest a mustache. He had it for a few months and then shave it off (after me begging), last year he had it for probably 6 months before finally shaving it off. This year, he had it from January until October (I rejoiced when it was finally gone). But I just lost it when I went into the bathroom and he was shaving his beard-- and leaving the dang mustache. I got 3 months without a mustache. 3. I'm frustrated, hurt, and honestly repulsed. He knows I can't stand it. No one likes it, not the kids, not his mom, nor his sister. He looks older and the biggest thing-- it's completely unkempt. Food gets in it, water literally dribbles out when he drinks. It hangs over his lip. It's horrible. I've begged, I've stayed quiet, I've yelled, I've reminded him- numerous times- I didn't marry someone with a mustache, I've asked him why he likes it, tried to compromise on time. Nothing. He won't shave it. Absolutely does not care I hate it. Says its his body and he can do what he wants-- great, but really? If he asked me to do something/not do something, I would. Because why not. Would really like to know if I'm being too much. Thanks.",
