      "selftext": "Hi everyone, I wanted to quickly summarize my experiences with someone I've met at a workplace and I'm not sure where things are between us and if i should completely let go of her.\nIt started one day when she looked and smiled at me in office when i didn't even know she existed. I eventually reached out to her and we've had good conversations in the beginning sporadically.\n\nI eventually asked her out and she said yes. But later due to work, she couldn't make it and said we'll plan in next month. But the thing is - I never asked her out again. Because i wanted to see how things pan out instead as it was too early and we barely knew much of each other.\n\nFast forward from there, i have noticed even though she was replying , she eventually took days at times to reply- so I made the stupid mistake of asking her on this behaviour. She said \"hey\" but I changed the subject thinking it may have been too uncomfortable for her.\nGoing forward , she became cold and distant - but it was subtle like if I talk to her , she would talk but cut ties and stop responding to me after few exchanges.\n\nSo i stopped pursuing her. Even when I met her in office for next 2 months, I didn't say anything. She seemed to notice it , and there were times in the last weeks where she would ask if I had lunch or not, (or) there was a time when she literally rotated her chair to follow my trail back to my seat as I wasn't even looking at her or talking to her for weeks by then. That day she made multiple attempts to look at me directly  , even when talking on phone.\n\nSo i thought , ehhh..you know. Let me see what happens - curiosity got the best of me so I texted her again. She seemed to change a bit, giving long responses and using sophisticated humour for few days. But it seems now that she again disappeared after i asked her a simple nonintrusive question on what she did that day.\n\nNow, at this point, I'm confused on whether to continue this or not - cause I'm not sure if she's interested or not - because when I pull away , she seems to not be very comfortable with it as you can see from her behaviour.\nSo what's up with this ? Can y'all help ?",
