      "selftext": "\nI (29F) am the oldest grandchild and the oldest daughter in my family. My grandpa had four children: 58F, my dad (54M), 48M, and 46F. My dad is the only one who has a decent job; the others rely on him for their daily expenses (this is important).\n\nMy grandpa lost his battle with cancer a week ago, and the whole family is distraught and sad. I stepped up to buy all the groceries for the funeral, which cost 2.6k. My dad gave me 800 for the wet ingredients. I used 2.6k of my own money, and the 800 was from my dad. In our culture, funerals last at least seven days: three days for every relative to view the body, the burial on the fourth day, and rosary prayers on the fifth to seventh days. During this time, villagers often give donations to the family.\n\nFrom the first day to the seventh, I prepared, cleaned, and cooked breakfast, lunch, and dinner. The other family members only did minimal chores, like cutting onions and washing dishes. I busted my ass for seven days, with no time to grieve. I felt it was my duty, as the oldest daughter and grandchild, to step up while the rest of the family grieved.\n\nYesterday, as I was relaxing in the living room, my dad brought up the topic of donations. He said the total amount collected was 10k and that he had already split it five ways among his siblings and grandma. I asked him if I could claim the 2.6k I had spent on groceries. To my surprise, my dad said, \u201cWhat for? I never asked you to buy anything.\u201d\n\nI was livid. I replied, \u201cI did that because none of your siblings tried to help with the groceries for the funeral, and I cleaned and cooked for seven days straight.\u201d He shot back, \u201cI never asked you to do any of that,\u201d and gave me the silent treatment for the rest of the night. My mom tried to intervene, but my dad dismissed everything she said.\n\nThis morning, he tried to pay me back 1k, but the way he handed it to me made me feel like a beggar. I hate being treated that way. I told him to keep the money and said I would never help with anything again.\n\nNow, we\u2019re no longer on speaking terms. So, AITA?\n\nEdit:\n\nMy dad is the type of person who likes to share his money with his siblings but not with the family he created",
