      "selftext": "\n\nI moved into my boyfriend\u2019s house 2 months ago with my 7 year old cat.\n\nMy cat has always been underweight so I got into the habit of offering him any bits of meat/eggs/safe produce that I may be eating, hoping to get more in him on top of his food. He turns his little nose up at everything but I still try. So far, in 7 years, I\u2019ve discovered that he likes steamed carrots and plain yogurt. \n\nMy boyfriend hates that I do this and it\u2019s become a frequent argument between us. \n\n\nHis points \n\n1. It\u2019s a waste of food. He knows that I know that there\u2019s a 99.9% chance the cat will reject the food.\n2. The dog is not allowed human food and seeing it being offered to the cat muddies his training\n3. He\u2019s mentioned it bothers him and thus is disrespectful to continue doing so\n\nMy points \n\n1. It\u2019s a fingernail sized piece of food from *my* plate. Maybe a bit of a waste but I\u2019m not throwing him an entire steak.\n2. I don\u2019t even try if it\u2019s something with garlic or onion since it\u2019s bad for him. And that\u2019s a lot of what we eat so this is only a 1-2x/week thing \n3. I\u2019ve done this for my cats whole life meaning it\u2019s a habit that predates my relationship by 5 years. \n4. The vet never said the dog couldn\u2019t eat some bites of people food. He can give his dog a bite of salmon if he wants, no one is stopping him. \n5. I just don\u2019t think it\u2019s that big of a deal \n\nAITAH?",
