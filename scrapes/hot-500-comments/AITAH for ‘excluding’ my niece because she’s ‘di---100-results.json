      "selftext": "So, I\u2019m gonna preface this by saying I love my niece(11), she\u2019s awesome, a little shit at times but still awesome. \n\nSo, me, my sisters and my friends like to hang together and because everyone\u2019s got kids except me and one other friend we usually host at one of their houses because it\u2019s almost impossible for everyone to get childcare, so we just go to whoever can\u2019t get a sitter for the night. \n\nWe will have some wine, some of the girls smoke weed etc but it\u2019s not a party, nothing inappropriate and if any of the kids came downstairs or needed a responsible adult etc they\u2019d find a ton. \n\nThe problem started when one of the groups daughters (13) wanted to stay down with us for a bit after bed, her mum said sure, she showed us some TikTok dances that we all tried and failed at and we all had a laugh, she went to bed when asked and it was fine. \n\nA week after we do it at my sisters home and when I get there I\u2019m surprised her daughter, the niece I refer to in my title (11) is still up. I give her a hug and say she\u2019s lucky to have such a late night and she says oh the party\u2019s just getting started. I was confused but just laughed. For context she\u2019s got adhd and autism and sometimes just says things that to her make sense but baffle me, I too have adhd so I don\u2019t get what she\u2019s talking about but I get that to her she\u2019s probably just made a hilarious joke. \n\nAnyway I ask my sister what time is leya (niece) going to bed and she said \u2018oh whenever she\u2019s too tired\u2019 and I\u2019m like\u2026 but you know she\u2019s a mare when she\u2019s tired? And she kinda just brushes me off saying that she getting older now and wants to join in like our friends daughter did the last time.\n\nAnyway everyone else arrives and it\u2019s just a nightmare, she dominated every conversation, gets frustrated, keeps doing random attention seeking behaviour like pretending to grab the wine bottle etc\u2026 all the things you can expect when a divergent kid who craves routine is thrown off and tired basically. \n\nlots of the kids in the group are divergent, lots of the mums are single, so we all love and understand each others kids BUT the whole point of this time is to be away from the kids and just be ourselves. \n\nThe night ended with everyone having to leave early as me and my sister had to wrestle leya into her room with her screaming crying and fully melting down. I know it sounds dramatic because she\u2019s 11 but she\u2019s 5\u201d7 and quite overweight so she nearly threw me down the stairs during this altercation. \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything to my sister in the moment even though we all knew this would happen, she looked embarrassed and defeated and I felt like she just wanted her kid to be able to join in like the others can. I just said well done for trying your best. \n\nSo anyway the next session roles around and I\u2019ve volunteered to make a curry so we are hosting at mine. I nearly thought it was a mirage when I saw my niece walking up my driveway with my sister\u2026 \n\nI\u2019m like\u2026 is everything okay? Is Mac okay(her husband who would be looking after my niece) And my sister just says oh yes I just thought I\u2019d give him the night off.\n\nThey both just walk in and I\u2019m confused but also starting to panic. When me niece comes round I hide my PlayStation, my valuables, anything breakable. Not cash, she\u2019s not a thief she\u2019s just so destructive and you just don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen if she has a melt down. I\u2019m not prepared and I tell my sister this. She\u2019s got her back up and says how it\u2019s fine and leya just wanted to prove herself after last week. Literally as she\u2019s saying this I hear something heavy drop upstairs. It\u2019s my porcelain doll from my great grandmother, and it\u2019s smashed, completely. \n\nI look at my niece and she\u2019s panicking, flustered, apologising, and now I\u2019m even more scared because I know I need to get her down the stairs before she fully melts down because I don\u2019t have a safe room for her to smash up. \n\nMe and my sister manage to get her into the car, and my sister says nothing. I am reassuring my niece trying to stop her from freaking out and going ape, but my sisters just in silence. \n\nThey left once she was somewhat calm and I text my sister saying I don\u2019t blame her for the doll, and I don\u2019t blame her for her daughter wanting to be involved with the big girls, but she can\u2019t show up unannounced with her especially not when it\u2019s supposed to be girls night and she knows I\u2019m totally child free so my home isn\u2019t baby proof never mind leya proof. Since then she won\u2019t speak to me, she\u2019s talking to the rest of the group and everything and told one person she isn\u2019t talking to me because I ostracise her daughter becuase she\u2019s disabled. I\u2019ve tried to message her, I even showed up at her house, she just closed the curtains. \n\nI just want my baby sister back and I honestly just feel awful but at the same time I don\u2019t think I\u2019m asking for much, the rest of the group say they agree with me but idk if everyone\u2019s just trying to play nice to everyone. I don\u2019t even really care if I\u2019m the asshole I\u2019m honestly just more interested in if anyone knows how I can fix this. We have never fell out like this but tbh I do very much have to be the bigger person a lot so idk, idk if she\u2019s done with me or just being mardy, this has just never happened before. ",

She didn't dominate the conversation or act out for attention. She simply joined the group for a bit, whereas 11yo basically needed to be babysitted the whole time she was there.\n\nI hate to say this, but your niece IS different and your sister needs to accept that some of the rules and ways she is treated or allowed/not allowed to do need to be altered to meet her where she is at and wont be the same as it is with other 11 year olds. I love how you all do your best to accommodate her and include her but your sister is taking it for granted. She loves her child, but she needs to respect how she is and do what is best for her, which may not necessarily be what she wants. Being differently abled does not excuse you from taking responsibility and consequences for your actions with a free pass.
