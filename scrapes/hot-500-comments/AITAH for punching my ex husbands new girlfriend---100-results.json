My daughter\u2019s dad sent texts admitted to Haley beating our daughter with a belt, and the pictures of the welts and bruises on my daughters. \n\nShe was recently arrested.\n\nMy daughter no longer sees her father. I have full custody and I\u2019m in the process of seeing if there\u2019s anything I can do to get his parental rights terminated. \n\nRead my last post for clarification!",
