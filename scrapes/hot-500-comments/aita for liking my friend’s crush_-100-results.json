One of my closest friends started liking him too last year and she was very open about it, so they starting talking. But she eventually rejected him and I started becoming friends with him, thinking I might have a chance. Turns out, she didn\u2019t actually want to reject him and just got nervous when he asked her out, so now she\u2019s looking to get with him again. But she\u2019s a very pretty girl and has tons of guys on her roster, so she won\u2019t even totally commit to him. Can I still try to get with him or would that be like stealing my friend\u2019s man?",
