      "selftext": "So, I\u2019m really unsure if I handled this right, and I need some opinions.\n\nSo, I (18F) am really short \u2013 like barely 5 feet tall. I\u2019ve been used to people making jokes about my height my whole life. Last weekend, I was at the mall with friends, and we passed by a group of guys. They started talking about \u201cshort girls\u201d in a really annoying way, saying stuff like, \u201cThey\u2019re cute but not very useful,\u201d and \u201cYou can easily boss them around.\u201d\n\nOne of them looked directly at me and said, \u201cYou probably wouldn\u2019t understand, little girl.\u201d That\u2019s when I snapped. I told him to stop, but he just laughed and said, \u201cWhat are you going to do about it?\u201d I don\u2019t know why, but in that moment, I just got really upset and said something back. He didn\u2019t stop and i got so angry that I hurled my bag in his face and hit him so hard in his nose, so it started bleeding. I think it started bleeding, because my phone was in it which hitteted him. I didnt know what to do. I  said \"SORRY\" and ran away.\n\nI didn\u2019t mean for anything bad to happen, but he couldnt stop talking bad about me.\n\nNow, I\u2019m wondering if I overreacted. Should I have just ignored him, or was I right to stand up for myself?\n\nSo, AITAH for giving him a lesson?",
