      "selftext": "My boyfriend bought a house. We have been together 16 months. He is almost done renovating the house he's been working on for about 5 months. He has included me in most decisions he makes about the house as far as decor and the look, about 50% of the time. I have never doubted his love either. He asked me to move in 6 months in and continues to talk about it.\n\nToday I was coming home from a party at my mother's for the holidays and offered to come help him at his house the next day. He agreed and asked me to do a few things. I went, even though I could have stayed at my mom's or just studied at my apartment (I'm a part time student). I like to help him because he has said he wants me to live with him multiple times.... I would have loved that, mostly because I liked him so much. I've never lived with a partner but I know it's difficult at times. I've lived with 3 different roommates and I know it's challenging at times but fun so it's worth it.\n\nLong story short, I tipped a bag of grout over and he said, \"this is why I don't want to work with anyone!\" He shouted this. I did not spill anything, but started to cry involuntarily, I tried to stop the tears but they came. I went home and cried a lot he tried to call me but I didn't feel like I could talk with him yet. While texting he said \"I get frustrated when people insist on helping when I don't need it\" I explained, \"I wil not offer my help anymore\". He said \"Sounds good, thanks.\"\n\nThis makes me think what would happen if I spill coffee or red wine, or juice even.... It makes me feel like I am wrong to help?\n\nTL;DR: my boyfriend is almost done renovating his house. I feel like he is mad at me for helping(due to him saying that) even though he wants me to move in). \n\n",
