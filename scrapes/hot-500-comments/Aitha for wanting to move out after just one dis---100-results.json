      "selftext": "I hope everyone is doing well. English is not my first language so please bear it with me. This might sound like a rant but i am just trying to give every details to be fair. \n\ni just moved in with my boyfriend few months ago. He owns the house but his friend lives with him. His friend pays rent (helps with mortgage) and bills. I am currently a university student (no current part time job as i just moved in to this country as well but i am looking). \n\nWhen i first moved in, i noticed couple of messes here and there. The friend does online business so whenever he gets orders he would put the \u2018about to dispatch parcels\u2019 in a pile on the stairs. He would invite his friend over for drinks and usually after a piss up they would just leave the glasses and cups in the sink, cans and bottles on the kitchen table. He also has a dog. i\u2019d say barely kept since as far as i can recall he has never taken her to a vet/groomer. I remember him getting mad at the dog for biting her nail but honestly ive never seen them getting trimmed. Either way, his dog would create a mess as well. He had also put a glass of moulded beer/wine on two different occasions in the sink. Luckily it was my boyfriend who was doing the dishes (on both occasions) so he had to deal with it not me hihi. All and all, even after those, i would just clean it up whenever ive got the time. I would also cook because that is my coping mechanism and would prefer to say i am better at it as compared to the other two. \n\nHowever, last week, i was bombarded with assignments. That and occasionally missing friends and family back home. It\u2019s also good to note i commute to uni everyday (half an hour walk from/to train station, another half on the train and then 15 mins to campus). I cleaned the house every friday cause that is my day off uni. I was so tired from going out and about on saturday and on Sunday i finally got my chill time. I admit that i had left a glass of water and a bottle of drink in the living room and did not clean it up afterwards. Monday, after i left at 9 am came back at about 6pm, we all decided to watch some film and after it ended i got tired again and admittedly i left a bag of crisp in the living room as well. Tuesday was roughly the same time of coming and leaving except i came a little later (about 7pm i think). Wednesday when i got home at about 1, i cooked some lunch before getting an idea of doing the dishes while i waiting for my hair to process (i thought about dying it at home). I immediately went upstairs to get started, but realised that the stuffs i got might not be enough. Then amazon declined my bank, and i had to sign up for another local bank instead. I was caught up with it until the friend came home (earlier than i expected). \n\nBefore i got the chance to come downstairs and let him know i\u2019ll be taking care of the dishes, i overheard him berating me to his mate who happened to be there. The thing is, the blame was put all on me even though there was some other dirty dishes from the night before (friend and his mate had a piss up) and breakfast (boyfriend had his cereal and a cup of coffee). There was also a pile of clothes (jackets and hoodies) of bf\u2019s and mine but again that was blamed on me. Not only that, bf had also been home before him (he knew bcs he saw it from the front door camera). But i was the one who was blamed. \n\nWe had a little argument and he said that after his long shift he just wanted to come home to a clean tidy house to which i was like \u2018everyone wants that, everyone has had a long shift\u2019. Point is i dont understand why he\u2019s complaining about picking up after my mess when i have been doing so the moment i moved in. After he left i cried to my boyfriend because i was upset for carrying the blame when i feel like i shouldn\u2019t have. Bf had a word with him to which he then kept yelling and shouting (his mate was in the next room, i was upstairs). He claimed the kitchen to be his, and that i was a pain in the arse. In al honesty it hurt me a little. \n\nWe did have a meeting the next day about what happened. It was my boyfriend who called the meeting; initial point of meeting is to lay out the pet peeves we\u2019ve got on each other. However i used the event to defend myself. He did apologise for badmouthing me but not to the fact that he blamed me for all of the mess even though i was not the one who solely contributed to it. I feel like it is unfair. Now i dont even feel comfortable walking around the house especially when he is around because it makes me feel like i am not actually welcomed and that none of my effort appreciated. \n\nI feel like moving out since i dont think i have the rights to make him move out. i know it will hurt my boyfriend\u2019s feelings which i really want to avoid but i cant just keep living in fear like this. Everytime i overhear this guy says my name i get anxious. Aimta for leaving the mess? Aimta for wanting to move out? Should i even move out?",
