      "selftext": "AITAH for being distant from my family to avoid lice?\n\nI\u2019m 13 years old and live with my dad full time. He moved his girlfriend (Lauren, age-32) and her kid (name- Kenna Age-6) into our house 1yr into their relationship and they have been living with us for 2 years now. I really didn\u2019t mind them being around that much at first until the whole lice thing. It all started when after they moved in and Kenna asked for me to sleep in her bed with her because she was scared and did not want to be by herself. A few days after I had slept in there I noticed I had lice and told Lauren so she would treat Kenna\u2019s hair. I treated my hair and Lauren treated Kenna\u2019s and I didn\u2019t sleep in there again. After a few weeks and her second treatment I figured the lice was gone and played tag with her when she asked and surprise I have lice again. This kept going on for 2 months, Lauren would say the lice is gone, id believe her, then get lice again. Eventually I just stopped playing with Kenna and kept my distance. I would check Kenna\u2019s head every week when Lauren treated her hair and it seemed like it wasn\u2019t getting any better, there were LAYERS of nits all throughout her head and after 1 year of them living here I could see them crawling on top of her head. She has had lice for 1 whole year now. Just so you can get a visual, an example is when me, Lauren, Kenna, and my dad were on our way to the beach, Kenna was sitting on a white towel beside me in the backseat and there was what looked like black dots all over the towel and when i took a closer look IT WAS LICE and they were literally falling off of her and were all over her clothes. It stayed like this and I kept keeping my distance and wouldn\u2019t sit on any furniture except for my bed. anyways, now that u know how it started and how bad it is, Fast forward to now, we moved a few weeks ago and she STILL HAS LICE AFTER 2- GOING ON 3 YEARS. Lauren has lice, Kenna has lice, my dad most likely does since him and Lauren sleep in the same bed. Its actually so bad that when Kenna went to school one day the whole class had a lice check and when the nurse saw Kenna\u2019s head she called dss for neglect.. The only person in this house without lice is me and i have gotten it from them about 6-7 times. I wont hug anyone in my house, wont sit on any furniture in the house that isn\u2019t my bed, and wont even touch anybody. This is starting to piss them off and they think I\u2019m having an attitude when they go to hug me and I turn or when I say no every time Kenna asks to play, even though I have explained why i am doing this. I can still, to this day, see lice crawling on top of Kenna\u2019s hair and see layers of nits, it literally looks like someone sprinkled salt on her head and it freaks me out. Lauren says her and Kenna don\u2019t have lice and the eggs i\u2019m seeing are just dandruff and hatched eggs that wont come out of her hair even though they both violently scratch their heads 24/7.. like what\ud83d\ude2d I get anxious every time I accidentally get around them with my hair down and will comb my hair with a lice pick for hours to make sure i don\u2019t have lice again and go into a full panic whenever my hair does itch. My hair is about waist length and is healthy and i\u2019m tired of having to treat it continuously when i get lice because it creates so many more flyaways and split ends than i already have and all I want is a beautiful head of hair, free of lice. I\u2019m actually starting to hate it here and I\u2019m to the point where i want to shave my head. anyways, AITAH for being distant from my family to avoid lice?",
