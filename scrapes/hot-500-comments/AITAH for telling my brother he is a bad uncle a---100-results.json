      "selftext": "My brother agreed to babysit my kids ages 6 and 8 for a few hours yesterday while me and my husband were at a work party together. \n\nWhen I got back home, I noticed a strange smell on the couch. Upon a closer look, I found some psychedelic mushrooms crumpled up and left on the cushions. I was shocked and pretty furious. Luckily, the kids were asleep in their rooms, so I assume they didn\u2019t see anything, but the thought of them possibly being around that stuff really freaked me out.\n\nI immediately called my brother and confronted him about it. He laughed it off and said it was just a little something that he had with him and that he forgot to put it away. I told him that he is a bad uncle for being so irresponsible and putting the kids at risk. We ended up getting into a bit of a heated argument over it, where he claimed I was overreacting and that I didn\u2019t need to make a big deal out of it. Now, he\u2019s not talking to me and says I blew things out of proportion.",
