      "selftext": "I (F18) and my bf (M20) have been dating for two years for context we met through mutual friends and I approached him I didn\u2019t know he was two years older until 5 months in and I loved him by then. Anyway, I planned a surprise dinner for our two year anniversary because he\u2019s been working so hard these last few months and I wanted to do something nice for a change. I booked us in for 8pm at a Premier Inn (his fav) because I thought that it would give him enough time to get there (he finishes work at 5pm and would take 10-15 mins for him to get there). But he called me at 7:55pm to say he got held up at work and had to help the new girl let\u2019s call her Mia, I asked how long he was going to be (I was willing to wait until 10pm) he said he don\u2019t think he could make it until 9:30pm. I said that\u2019s fine and during that time I looked up this girl turns out she\u2019s not new she\u2019s been there for 4 months. It got to 9:31pm and I gave up I text him to say I\u2019m going home I\u2019ll see him later (I also gave the restaurant his card number and ate starter, dinner, dessert and a bottle of wine \ud83d\ude09). He text me saying he was going to be 5 mins but I left him on read and went to bed. Fast forward 2 months I\u2019ve heard from him to say he was sorry I said we needed some space and haven\u2019t heard from him since but I did meet up with this girl in a Starbucks and she was pregnant so I let her go infront of me, she was very thankful. She gave her name and her name by coincidence was MIA. She sat down at a table and after I got my coffee I asked if I could sit with her (she looked upset). We got talking turns out she\u2019s 5 months along and she works at the same place my boyfriend does I asked if she was seeing anyone and she said HIS NAME. I asked how long they\u2019ve been together she said he asked her out once she was pregnant and they met through work on a night out DRUNK. So I think I did the right thing ditching him.",
