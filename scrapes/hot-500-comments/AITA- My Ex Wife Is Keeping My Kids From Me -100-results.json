      "selftext": "\nMy ex wife (25f) is purposely trying to keep our three kids from me (26m)\nMy wife and I are currently separated, as I moved out almost 4 weeks ago. I moved into my parents house, and she still lives in the condo I pay for, with our kids. \n\nThe reasons I left are numerous - She has a litany of mental health issues including PTSD, anxiety and depression. Over the last five years of our marriage, she spent so much time in bed, needed so much from me just to get through the day- meanwhile I worked and struggled to provide. Especially the last month of our marriage, I was doing almost everything- she didn't hardly get out of bed for almost 4 weeks after she had our son. Eventually I just couldn\u2019t handle the pressure anymore of being everything to everyone. Having three kids under three and a half, working full time, and then coming home to deal with her and her insecurities and depression - took a toll on me and I couldn\u2019t do it anymore. \n\nSince then, she has been refusing to let me keep the kids overnight. She says they\u2019re \u201ctoo young\u201d and that it\u2019s unreasonable to send them overnight because she nurses the younger two and can\u2019t pump enough. \nBut the week after I moved out, she went to an inpatient mental facility for five days, and I had all three kids during that time she was gone. Our 3.5 and 2 year old did great- they are ecstatic to see me every time! Our baby also was great and took a bottle and drank the milk she was pumping and sending to us. She made enough milk for him for the whole 5 days. She says she won\u2019t let me give him formula, but if we didn\u2019t have enough breast milk, I\u2019m confident he would drink that too. I deeply care for my children and will do anything to have time with them. \n\nShe\u2019s insisting that I can only have our son (the baby) for 4 hours on the days I see the children- which is only three days a week, and no overnights. I\u2019ve said I could take them from Saturday night until Tuesday mornings, since I don\u2019t work Sunday and Monday. She refuses, saying \u201cthey\u2019re too little\u201d, and only letting me take the baby for 4 hours each of those days. Again, our son is almost 2 months old, and has taken a bottle from me for much longer than this time frame. It\u2019s clear that her issue isn\u2019t with what\u2019s best for the children, but to get back at me for leaving her. \n\nNow, she\u2019s telling me I can\u2019t come into our house- which, mind you, I still pay for- when I come to get the kids. That she doesn\u2019t want any contact with me and she will have someone take the kids outside to me when I arrive. I told her that\u2019s not happening- it\u2019s my house. I have every right to come into it. \n\nThis morning, when I arrived to pick up the children, she came downstairs and told me that, as they had not woken up yet, I had to leave. I told her I would be waking them up at 9:30, because she lets them sleep too late anyway. She called her dad, who lives nearby, to come over, and he started telling me I needed to get out of my house. Then she called the police on me, tells them that I \u201ccome in without asking\u201d and \u201cwont leave\u201d. She even goes on to tell\nhim how unsafe and threatened she feels by me, which is her new go-to since I left- suddenly now\nI was \u201cabusive\u201d and \u201ccontrolling\u201d. (Funny how she only says that now that I\u2019ve left.)\n\nI\u2019m filing for divorce this weekend.\nAITA in this divorce? ",
