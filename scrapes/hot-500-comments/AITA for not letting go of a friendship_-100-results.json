      "selftext": "Hi there reddit, trying to navigate a kind of sad situation that simply won't leave me alone so...here goes. Me and this guy, Jake, have known each other since secondary school (middle school for those not from the UK) when we got paired together for something in school and were pretty close ever since. Went to the same uni and were basically inseparable. We were always a pair of nerds so getting with girls never came easy but eventually I met my ex, Amy, through a DnD club we attended. It wasn't a love at first sight situation, we kind of got to know each other after a while, I developed feelings and one day I said hey, fancy a drink? We ended up dating some time later and I could tell it didn't sit right with Jake. I spoke to him and while he never said anything, I asked if we'd still be friends and I said of course. I mean, I always assumed we were still friends but I guess yeah, we drifted apart. For me, Amy was my world, and I just wanted to devote all my energy to loving her. Going out every other day with Jake or going on these long drives to cities and getting roped into going to a museum stopped. It wasn't malicious or hostile or anything, I just wanted to do these things with Amy instead.\n\nWe humoured Jake by taking him with us as a third wheel a few times, we even tried to set him up with some of her friends too. Never worked out. They were never interested, he was never interested, eventually we just stopped bothering. My time with Jake dwindled, eventually we'd see each other a couple times a month solo, the rest via DnD. One day he just stopped going, I assume because he never really had anyone else to play with and only really went for my sake which sucked, but I never pressed it. I saw Jake less and less, we talked online less and less. Yeah...things hollowed out. I should add we never stopped talking but it did reach the point where weeks could go by before one of us made a move by sending a funny tweet or whatever. I guess I just...never really noticed? Anyway, for a while things with Amy were rocky. The rope finally snapped around Halloween time. Horrible, messy breakup that more or less torpedoed my social circle. I had to stop attending the club because it was too awkward and most of my friends were mutuals I met via Amy. I was mentally and emotionally battered. So I went to the only person I felt I could rely on: Jake.\n\nI messaged him asking if he had a moment to talk, this must have been like early evening? No response. Sometime goes by and I see the discord mobile notification pop up. Message him again asking if he's alright? And then say I just really need a friend right now. Again no response. Some more time passes while he's offline before he responds back and apologises, saying he was at the theatre. Doesn't ask what the problem is or anything. Just that. I said it's great to see him, and then just admit, me and Amy broke up. He sends a hug emote and \"hope you're hanging in there mate\". It...kind of felt like a slap to the face. Honestly the whole conversation was painful. I needed a shoulder to cry on. He wasn't prepared to be it. Eventually I just asked if we could meet the next day and he apologised, saying he couldn't as he was attending a dinner. I asked with who and he got a bit weird and said it was a \"philosophy club\". I guess I got a bit desperate because I asked if I could come along and he just flat out said no. I didn't respond but he did message me an hour or so later asking if I'd like to meet for a drink at the next weekend. I said yes and we made some plans.\n\nSo skip ahead to next week and at the last minute he says he's been invited to another dinner, can we meet at a caf\u00e9 earlier in the day? I feel like I should have stood up for myself but I was so emotionally burnt out and had spent the better part of the week in bed, I just said sure, whatever. So we meet at this snooty caf\u00e9 by the sea front - he picked it - and he just didn't feel like the Jake I knew growing up. He was just so cold and aloof with this weird vagueness. I tried to ask him about this philosophy club and I never got a straight answer. When I asked how I'd join he did this weird laugh and said how only I'll know when it's my time to join. I dropped it after that and admitted I was in a bad way because of Amy. His response was something like \"well that's women isn't it? Play with matches, get burnt.\" Was quite taken aback and I guess he could tell because then he said \"you know, no woman no cry.\" I wasn't really in that right mental state to argue so I just said yeah. When I tried to push the breakup, he just wasn't interested and all his responses were either cold or sort of insinuated it was my own fault. I asked him if he had met anyone and he did that weird laugh again. I took that as a no. We wrapped up a bit after that and I said it was great to see him again and maybe we should go out for a drink sometime. He said maybe and I asked if there were any cute girls at his philosophy club and he gave me the most weird, 1000 yard stare and said \"It's a gentleman's club.\" After that he said he'd \"be in touch\". Didn't hear back from him so I messaged him Sunday to ask what's up? No response till Sunday. And even then that's when I prodded him. He says let's set a date for Friday, I say can we go check out this Warhammer group I've seen advertised? It took him two hours to respond with \"If we must.\" Thursday night: messages me to say he has to cancel, he's been invited to another meeting and this is \"very special\". I ask if he really can't give me one night and he apologises, saying this is very important to him. I left it there.\n\nSince then we've seen each other two more times. Both of them he was off and vague, clearly didn't want to be there and especially didn't want to hear any of my problems. We've spoken a bit online but again, he never really commits to anything and he just doesn't want to listen to anything I have to say. My first and only relationship ended in a car crash and I just want to share that with someone but he just won't let me and it fucking hurts me after everything we've gone through together. So I guess am I the asshole here? Should I keep trying to salvage what we had or should I just move on too?",
