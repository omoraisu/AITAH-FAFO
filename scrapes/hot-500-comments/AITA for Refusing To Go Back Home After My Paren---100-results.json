      "selftext": "I (18F) am from India, and like many here, my parents had my entire life planned out for me from the moment I could talk. I\u2019ve always loved literature and dreamed of studying it\u2014reading, writing, storytelling\u2014it\u2019s my passion. But to my parents, that was never an option. They were set on one thing: I was going to be a doctor. No debate.\n\nIn 11th grade, I begged them to let me take humanities and pursue my interests, but they outright refused. Instead, they forced me to take Biology and Math, claiming it was \u201cthe only respectable choice\u201d and that I\u2019d \u201cthank them later.\u201d The next two years were hell. Between coaching classes, relentless pressure to top my exams, and constant reminders that I was \u201ccarrying the family\u2019s honor,\u201d I was miserable. Every time I tried to tell them how unhappy I was, they dismissed me, saying I was \u201clazy\u201d or \u201cjust going through a phase.\u201d\n\nWhen I finished 12th grade, I turned 18, but I hadn\u2019t cleared NEET (the medical entrance exam). Honestly, I didn\u2019t even want to clear it. Medicine was never my dream, and they knew it. I thought this might finally make them realize that this path wasn\u2019t for me. Instead, they escalated.\n\nOne evening, they sat me down and, out of nowhere, brought up marriage.\n\nTheir reasoning? Since I wasn\u2019t becoming a doctor and, in their words, \u201cclearly wasn\u2019t serious about my life,\u201d I should marry someone who could \u201cstabilize\u201d me. They had even lined up a potential groom\u2014an older guy from a \u201cgood family\u201d who was well-off and supposedly \u201cresponsible enough\u201d to handle me.\n\nI was stunned. I couldn\u2019t believe they were giving up on my education altogether just because I didn\u2019t fit their mold. When I protested, they accused me of being \u201cungrateful\u201d and \u201crebellious.\u201d My dad said something like, \u201cIf you can\u2019t bring pride to this family, you can at least bring security by marrying well.\u201d\n\nThat was my breaking point.\n\nAfter that conversation, I secretly reached out to my maternal grandparents, who have always been more understanding. I told them everything, and to my surprise, they offered to help. They didn\u2019t have much, but they sent me enough money to get started. I also started doing online side hustles\u2014freelance writing, tutoring, and design work\u2014to support myself.\n\n\n I applied to a reputed institution for a BA in Literature, got accepted, and moved far away without telling my parents. Although this has been difficult, it\u2019s been the best decision of my life. For the first time, I feel free. I\u2019m studying what I love, meeting like-minded people, and finally building a future I can be proud of.\n\nMy parents, however, didn\u2019t take this lightly. When they realized I was gone, they freaked out. They called me dozens of times, showed up at my grandparents\u2019 house (who refused to tell them anything), and even tried to file a police report claiming I was \u201cmissing\u201d or \u201ckidnapped.\u201d The police couldn\u2019t do anything since I\u2019m legally an adult.\n\nBut last week, they found me.\n\nThey showed up at my place unannounced, furious. My mom cried and said I\u2019d \u201cruined the family\u2019s reputation,\u201d while my dad demanded that I pack my things and come home immediately. When I refused, they tried to guilt-trip me, saying things like, \u201cYou\u2019re abandoning your family for a stupid hobby,\u201d and \u201cDo you even know what people are saying about us?\u201d My dad even threatened to disown me if I didn\u2019t comply.\n\nI stood my ground and told them this was my life and my decision. That\u2019s when my mom said something that\u2019s been stuck in my head ever since:\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t come back now, don\u2019t bother calling us ever again.\u201d\n\nThey left after hours of arguing, and I haven\u2019t heard from them since. My grandparents fully support me, but they\u2019re worried about the family fallout. I feel torn. On one hand, I\u2019m finally living the life I\u2019ve always wanted. On the other, I can\u2019t shake the guilt of walking away from my parents, even if they\u2019ve been controlling and unsupportive.\nThis is a burner account, my relatives know about my primary account, have seen and sent some of my posts to my parents.\n\nSo, AITA for refusing to go back home and live the life my parents want for me?\n\nTL;DR: My parents forced me into a science stream and planned to marry me off when I didn\u2019t clear NEET. I left at 18 with help from my grandparents and now study literature. They found me and demanded I return, threatening to cut ties if I don\u2019t. Am I wrong for standing my ground?\n\n",
