      "selftext": "My best friend, Sarah, asked me to be a bridesmaid for her wedding, and I was excited at first. But as the planning went on, it started feeling more like a job than a fun celebration. She expected us to attend every pre-wedding event, some of which I couldn\u2019t afford. She also wanted us to buy $300 dresses, pay for hair and makeup, and split the cost of a bachelorette trip to another state.\n\nWhen I told her I couldn\u2019t afford all of it, she dismissed my concerns, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s my big day; you\u2019ll have to make it work.\u201d On top of that, she started micromanaging everything, including how we should post on social media about her wedding.\n\nThen, last week, she called me late at night to complain about me not RSVPing to a brunch she planned for the bridal party, even though I had told her I was working. That was the last straw for me. I told her I couldn\u2019t handle the stress and that I didn\u2019t want to be in the wedding anymore.\n\nShe went off, saying I was being selfish and ungrateful for not appreciating how she \u201cchose me\u201d for her special day. Now, a few of our mutual friends think I\u2019m in the wrong for backing out so close to the wedding. But honestly, I feel like she\u2019s treating me more like an employee than a friend.\n\nSo, am I the asshole for backing out?",
