      "selftext": "My girlfriend and I have been dating for 3 months. Her boyfriend was madly in love in her last relationship, but they broke up because they argued so much. She is now with me a year after they broke up, but she always brings up things he did for her that I don't do, such as paying for expenses. He would buy practically anything for her, so she says she is used to the idea of a boyfriend paying for everything. It's not that I do not want to buy her things as I normally pay for times we eat out and gifts such as Christmas we set a 150$ limit. However, one thing recently came up where I brought up going skiing, as it is one of my favorite things to do in the winter. She does not have any gear, so she wants me to pay for it. It is about 80$ for rentals and lifts tickets all in all and I don't want to spend that much as I would also have to buy my lift ticket so it would be 120$ in all plus tax. I told her I would rather not as it is very expensive and I don't have enough money, which isn't entirely true. It's not that I am poor; I am pretty well off, but it's just that I prefer to save money where I can. I'm getting a little sidetracked from the main subject, but she thinks I am rich because of my savings, which is a generous amount, but it is called savings for a reason. My savings are my college fund, and I prefer not to take out money unless I need to, so I generally leave it untouched. Thus, I usually don't have a lot of money to spend because I work an on-campus job that does not pay very well, and this is the money I spend. She thinks it's dumb that I save so much and don't offer to pay for her, but I don't see the problem. Sorry I keep getting sidetracked, but I thought I should also mention that she often brings up how unfair our financial lives are as I receive FAFSA, and she does not due to her parents making more. so she holds a grudge against me for this. Anyway, sorry for just kinda spewing, but I don't know what to do. I don't want to spend money I do not have to on her. Am I being a cheapskate, probably? Idk you tell me what you think",
