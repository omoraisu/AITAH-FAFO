      "selftext": "I (39F) have 2 kids with my ex husband (45M) who cheated on me. I found out about the almost 1-year long affair in April of 2018. He was never really apologetic but played the part of pretending to try to reconcile for an extra 6 months. During that time, he continued his affair with his co-worker who was also married. \n\nI started suspecting there was something going on in January 2018 when I noticed my ex was hiding his phone, going to work early, coming home late, and talking about this woman a lot. He claimed they were good friends from work and they were in a workout group together. When I asked him about the relationship he told me I was paranoid, crazy, etc, etc. The two of them also planned family outings for us. We got our kids together to have a picnic in the park, we went to a hockey game together, she invited to me to a Saved by the Bell trivia night. The two of them worked really hard to make our families seem like family friends. But I never liked her. The first time I met her, my ex asked what I thought and I said something to the affect of \"she talks a lot.\" \n\nWe got divorced in 2019. I had to do all the work in getting a lawyer, filing the papers, and finalizing the decree. He refused to do anything. He didn't fight me on much, which is good, but only because he's incredibly lazy and fighting would have been effort. During the separation, he lived in an extended stay motel and didn't have a single overnight with the kids unless I offered to leave my home and sleep elsewhere. I was doing 100% of work after he walked out. Once we sold our marital home and finalized the divorce, he started keeping the kids on his regularly scheduled visitation which ended up being roughly 60/40. \n\nDuring the \"reconciliation\" period, separation, and divorce, she would send me long messages about how sorry she was and how she was a really good person, blah, blah, blah. I will be honest, I was not very nice to her in my responses. She blamed me for people at work finding out about the affair and accusing her of sleeping her way to a promotion (he was the hiring manager). She texted me, emailed my personal email, and emailed my work email. She was everywhere and it was annoying.\n\nThe ex and his AP got married and I am remarried. We've moved past the whole affair but I don't like either one of them. I talk to my ex about the kids and that's it. I don't speak to her at all. She's been showing up to more things and trying to start conversations. She came to my daughter's party and insisted on helping with clean up and trying to talk to me. But I don't want her help. The way I see it, her and the ex can come to the party and interact with the kids. But I don't want to have to deal with them. \n\nI had to drop something for my son off at the ex's and she was down the street walking her dog. I said \"I'm just dropping this off on the porch\" and walked to the door. I heard her and the person walking with her snickering about me when I got back in my car. \n\nThe kids have thanked me for being \"friends\" with their dad which makes me laugh because I think he's one of the biggest pieces of shit to ever walk this earth. But I know I'm not overtly rude. Just standoff-ish. But watching those two women mutter about how rude I am bothered me. As long as I'm not affecting the kids' relationship with their dad, I don't think I should be required to chat it up with two people who made my life a living hell. But is that the expectation? \n\nAITA for not speaking to the affair partner and trying to be her friend?",
