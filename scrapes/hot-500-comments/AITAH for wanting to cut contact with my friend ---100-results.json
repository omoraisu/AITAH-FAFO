      "selftext": "I (30F) have been friends with a guy (33M) for about a year. We became very close and he started to confide in me a lot, but we have exactly zero romantic or sexual interest in one another. Two months ago he got a new girlfriend. I've never met her, but she's extremely jealous of everyone and everything - so obviously, his having a close female friend is seen as a threat by her, even though 95% of our communication happens via text. Today, I fell down on my skates and my ankle was pretty swollen, so I sent him a picture telling him what happened. It was as far away from a sexual picture as it could be (just my ankle with the hematoma and swelling), but she still made several comments about it, which he told me about. Apparently, she gave him grief over it and claimed I was trying to entice him with that picture of my fucked up ankle. Tbh, I'm too old to deal with this shit. I have no interest in having someone spread negativity towards me and about me because of her insecurities. I don't even know why she's so insecure (she's a fairly attractive woman and, from what I know about him, he's strongly against cheating in general, as he's been cheated on before). I don't accept overbearing jealousy in my own relationships and certainly don't want to be forced to take it from her. I also don't want to keep \"policing\" my messages to him because god forbid I say the wrong word and it makes her freak out about me again - maybe she has issues with my sending a picture of my dog or whatever (?). If she was a reasonable person, I'd hand her my unlocked phone so she could see I've never sent anything remotely flirty to him, but I know she'll have issues with anything, if she thinks a bruised ankle is \"enticing\". So I'm thinking about telling him I'll take a step back from the friendship to avoid harming his relationship and also to, quite honestly, just avoid the stress of dealing with her negativity. AITAH? I do genuinely care about him, he's been a good friend otherwise, but her attitude made me upset all day and I don't see it getting any better.",
