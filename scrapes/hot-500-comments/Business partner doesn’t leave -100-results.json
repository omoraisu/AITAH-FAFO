      "selftext": "My husband has a business partner - they\u2019ve worked together for probably 15 years. They work well together, have done great things together BUT he is a constant fixture in our lives to the point that I can\u2019t stand it. All day long they\u2019re on the phone together or texting about deals. And if he comes into town for a business meeting he doesn\u2019t leave - it\u2019s Sunday and he\u2019s been here since Weds for a meeting they had on Thursday, no idea when he\u2019s going to leave my house. I literally see him more than my own family members and my husband\u2019s kids, he stays in our house. There\u2019s a part of me that feels like an asshole for coming between my husband and his best friend/business partner but also, I just don\u2019t like him and he\u2019s always here. He doesn\u2019t seem to take hints from me he should leave, and my husband doesn\u2019t push him because he loves spending time with his bestie. Advice?",
