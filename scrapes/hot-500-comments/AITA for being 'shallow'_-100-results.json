      "selftext": "This might sound kinda dumb but I'm genuinely confused and would like to know if something I said makes me shallow. \n\nBasically me (f18) and my two best friends (f18 and m18) who we will call A and B have a group chat. A said that someone who has recently been on a reality TV show walked into her work today and she said she thought he was really attractive. She sent a picture of him and B agreed that he was attractive. \n\nI personally had never seen the show and had no idea who he was so I just asked who he was and what his name was. I didn't say anything about his attractiveness or anything like that. When I found out his name I googled him and found an article that said he got 4 A\\* at A-Level and was studying for a degree in biomedical engineering. Now, for me personally, intelligence is extremely attractive. I love someone who is academically smart (I am no genius but was probably a bit above average at school and loved it when a guy could keep up with me or do better than me in maths lol) and my friends know this. I have always just considered this as my 'type' the way people do with blonde hair or green eyes etc. Obviously it's not a dealbreaker but it is something that would draw me to someone in the first place. \n\nBy no means am I against dating someone who isn't 'smart'. Intelligence is not measured by how good someone's grades are and I know this. My last boyfriend was not someone who was stereotypically 'smart' (he was in the lower sets in school etc and got average to below average grades) but he was by no means stupid. I actually a friend who knew my type was often intelligent people who implied by ex was stupid because of his grades and I cut them off for it. However, I cared for my ex because of the person he was and didn't care less about the grades he got and this goes for any future boyfriend. While it may be a turnoff at the start because i do find intelligence attractive, if he can make me laugh and smile then that means 100x more to me than how good he is at school. \n\nSorry for going off track, just trying to give some context. Anyway, so when I saw how intelligent the person A and B were talking about appeared to be, I went back to the group chat and told them about his grades and degree and agreed that he was definitely attractive. \n\nHowever, B then called me shallow for saying this. I was confused and asked how thinking him being intelligent was attractive and he told me that I could find the most physically attractive guy on the planet but if he didn't have 5 A\\* and was a genius then I would call him ugly. This is obviously not true, my ex being an obvious example of why this is not true. I then asked B where I ever implied I didn't think the guy from the TV show was unattractive in the first place (because I had said absolutely nothing about his attractiveness before I googled him) and B just said that it was just a vibe he got from me. \n\nBefore I saw how intelligent he appeared to be, I'll admit, I didn't necessarily find him attractive, but I definitely didn't think he was ugly by any means either. He was just a person on a screen. His attractiveness/ looks in general didn't even cross my mind to be honest. I think generally for me someone's attractiveness doesn't cross my mind until I find out more information on them because until I know some stuff about them, they are just some random person. B was even the first person to tell me that in his opinion, I would not be able to date someone unless I had been friends for a long time first and knew them very well, which, after thinking about it, is probably true. Sorry if that sounds a bit weird but I hope you understand the point I'm trying to make. \n\nAnyway, after this I didn't respond because I was quite upset and didn't understand how it made me shallow. I thought being shallow was when you judge purely based off looks and nothing else? But I did the opposite of this? Plus, my attraction to intelligence is not a requirement, just kind of my type and I definitely don't think any less of someone just because they don't have perfect grades, it just means their intelligence is based in the real world rather than on a piece of paper. After this, A and B continued chatting on the group chat like nothing happened and A seemed to take B's stance. I haven't said anything else because I'm  still a little upset. I explained all this to another friend and she gave this long speech about attractiveness being subjective and personal but I feel like that was her way of agreeing with them without wanting to upset me so now I'm just confused. I guess I can see a little how it was shallow but I genuinely didn't mean it in a mean way. \n\nSo, AITA? Should I apologize to my friends? If I was genuinely being shallow please tell me how and why so I can stop being this was, I do not want to upset my friends as I love them very much.   \n",
