      "selftext": "I (36f) have been a caregiver to my inlaws for the last 2 years. They acquired lots of debt from their 3 other children.(Husband and I don't have any and never ask for things. His siblings were given cars, his parents took out 2 reverse mortgages on his older siblings, maxed credit cards and still have 14k in debt). I have been under a lot of stress taking my inlaws to appointments,ft caregiving, kids to school, house, grounds maintenance etc. I normally get up at 3am to start the day. Recently, I finally snapped(I was just tired and needed a break. My husbands siblings have not helped with his parents at all) and my husband responded that day with \"Why are you always so angry?\" I had stopped washing the dishes. My MIL was in ear shot of this. I got up, got dressed, gave my kiddos a kiss each. Told them I loved them and drove over to my friends house for a good cry out of frustration. She let me in allowed me to take the time to decompress and I went home .\n A few weeks later my husband came up to me and said his mother asked him when I left,\" You don't think she's having an affair? Do you?\". This took me completely off guard. Here I am sacrificing my time to care for her and her husband, and that's the first thing that crosses her mind? Not the lack of support from her kids but that! I told my husband that I refused to help her and would no longer be her caregiver. The one thing I've never wavered on is my stance on being faithful. So, WIBTA, in refusing to take care of my MIL after this? \n\nEdit: For those of you asking about my husband. He shot my MIL down real quick when she mentioned it. We have an open communication, thus why he told me about his mothers response. He's on my side when it concerns his mother. We are currently talking about accommodations for my inlaws over coffee. As for my parents my mother left my siblings after my father's passing of leukemia. My sister became their guardian. My father passed away when I was 17. He was taken care of by my siblings and myself until his passing. \nBack story:They had to sell their home 2 yrs ago due to them not being financially in debt(over 30k in debt prior). I agreed they could stay at the time as I had a good relationship with my inlaws. Recently, my FIL was admitted into the hospital, then rehab, now home with us. He is legally blind and has multiple health problems. I was a caregiver for many years(10+ with dementia), so I don't mind my FIL in the least. He doesn't bother me and does his own thing. \n\nUpdate#1: \nI had a nice long chat with my husband today. I took some of your guys' advice on things. I talked to him about his siblings getting involved. He said they won't make an effort. To which my response was neither will I. If they won't give them their time, they can pay for their care(his siblings all make decent money but are terrible holding onto it). As for living arrangements, he has until the new years to find accommodations for them. Or I will find some for my kids and myself.(This got his attention the most as I'm not one to go back on my word). I sacrificed enough and am currently looking at jobs. I haven't had one as I was a SAHM for many years(6). My husband was the breadwinner, and I was glad to be home with my twins at the time. I will update you all come new years. ",
