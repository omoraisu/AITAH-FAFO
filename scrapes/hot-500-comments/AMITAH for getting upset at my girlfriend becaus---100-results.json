      "selftext": "for context me and my girlfriend had a little \u201cbreak\u201d period for abt 3 weeks, and in those three weeks we both talked to new people, she did a little more than talking and actually attempted to have sex with him even tho she claims she didnt feel comfortable so she stopped the moment she realized what she was doing, however she did let him finger her and touch her. me however, i did nothing more than flirt and entertain a girl for not even a full week, we got back together about 4 weeks ago and we were perfectly fine, we were actually better, and we were having sex..ALOT of sex, good sex too..until around 2 weeks ago she got torn down there from too much sex..i think?? or too rough, idk but she was torn so we took a break for a couple days then tried to have sex again and it hurt her so we stopped. ever since then, we kinda both got busy with work so stopped hanging out as much meaning the sex slowed down, today was finally a day we could hang out just us 2 but it was late in the day so we didn\u2019t really have much time, ive been having needs way more since its been 2 weeks and i was just craving her the whole time we were together but obviously i didnt want to make her feel pressured so i didnt say or do anything extra, until she was about to leave that i began kissing her more and put her in the mood, we had a show playing and the episode was about to end so she told me to wait until the episode ended, so i did, and i would give her kisses here and there until it ended, when it did, she told me she wasnt in the mood anymore and didnt want to do it and that she had to go home because it was late and she had schoolwork, so i got upset and said \u201cokay\u201d, as she was leaving she noticed that i was upset and asked me if it was because she edged me which i responded with yes, and she said \u201cits okay, sex isnt that important\u201d which i responded with \u201cwell to me it is\u201d and thats when she said \u201cwhy are you getting so upset..because you havent gotten pussy?\u201d and to which i responded with \u201cyea kinda..i mean its been 2 weeks. and ive been wanting it i barely got to see you and spend anytime with you\u201d to which she got upset and said \u201cnoted.\u201d before leaving. \nnow i feel guilty for how i acted and i wanna know if it is semi justified to feel upset or if im just an ah\n\n\ntldr - my gf and i havent had sex in 2 weeks and tonight she made it seem like we were gonna do it and got me excited for it to then say no and leave which caused me to get upset and have an argument",
