      "selftext": "I need to know if I'm the asshole or not.... I have visitation rights for my sisters daughter since she was 2, it's now been 11 years. And my sister has NEVER been a mother to this child, her father has full custody of her.  When I get her my sister still doesn't do anything with her and now all of a sudden she wants to take me to court to take my rights away because that's her daughter. And ALL my family agrees!!! They all think I've turned this child against her. The child doesn't want to go to her mom's cause she knows she has never been there for her. So I refused to sign my rights over. So now they are all calling me the asshole!! Am I in the wrong??? Should I sign them over?",

You should not be worried AT ALL if she is happy and stable with you and expresses that to the judge.  If her mom takes you to court all that will happen is that she\u2019ll waste her money on an attorney only to likely be forced to pay additional child support and possibly have some mandatory visits with her daughter, likely supervised if she\u2019s never even spent time with her.
