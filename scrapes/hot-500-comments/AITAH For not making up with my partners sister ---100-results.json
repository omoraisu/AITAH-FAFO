      "selftext": "*posting anonymously*\nso, I\u2019ve been looking for a way to get a non biased answer on this current situation me (25F), and my partner (24M) are dealing with. For some context, as it does matter, my partner has a friend named (it\u2019s fake for privacy reasons). \u201cJake\u201d, has been friends with my partner for over 7 years now and they\u2019ve relatively been close within the last few years specifically. Close enough to where Jake was crashing in the spare room at our place, (Our place being my partners house with both my partners sisters also living there). So as you can imagine, Jake is very close with my partners family as well with how often he stays there and is practically apart of the family.\nWe had noticed while Jake was staying at our place, that he was getting a little to close to my partners sister but we didn\u2019t think anything of it as we know that Jake knew my partners feelings on his best friends dating his sister. The only reason my partner doesn\u2019t want his best friends dating his sister is being of the potential and very likely fallout from the break-up leading to them no longer being friends.  And for some more context, one of my partners friends had actually previously gone behind his back and screwed around with his sister and when my partner found that out, he cut him off so quickly and Jake was there when this happened so he knew exactly why my partner felt the way he did. So my partners mom had actually caught Jake and my partners sister sneaking off to her room and we can imagine what they were doing and how often they were doing that behind everybodies backs... So i made sure to confront Jake and tell him he needed to have a civil and adult chat with my partner to make sure that he found out from him and nobody else, and i told Jake if he was seriously going to go for his sister to make sure it\u2019s the real deal and no BS. So i then called my partner out and told him jake had something he needed to tell him, and the truth comes out. And long story short my partner told him he\u2019s okay with it and he\u2019s super happy for them to be together, on the terms that they actually stay together and that it\u2019s not a quick hook up or nothing. So all is good, right? Wrong. We had noticed some tension from Jake through the next few months and it was just super off-putting considering my partner was okay with them dating as long as nothing changed between their friendship.  \nSkip to a few months after they\u2019re dating, My partners sister was having a bad day, and when my partner went to use the downstairs bathroom she completely freaked out on him and told him to \u201cGTFO\u201d, of her bathroom. So my partner being confused, refused to leave as it was an unreasonable request and the bathroom was technically not hers, but we call it hers because it is close to her room. So they ended up in a screaming match and it resulted with my partners sister screaming \u201cI\u2019m so happy i turned jake against you!\u201d. Pretty much giving us the reason as to why Jake has been giving us the cold shoulder recently\u2026 so when we heard from his sister that she turned Jake against us, it immediately rubbed us the wrong way and we decided to just stop associating with them within the house. My partners sister did write him a note saying she was sorry, but my partner just said he accepted it but just don't want to associate with her or Jake at this time.\nOkay, so now me and my partner are constantly being harassed by his mother to make up with Jake and sister even though she knows exactly what happened. What makes me even more confused is that they clearly don\u2019t like us, so why should WE apologize and try to make amends? His mom expresses to us often how much it hurts her that her kids are fighting, but i feel as if there is no going back to the old way. \nSo, AITAH for not wanting to make up with Jake and sister? \nAnd to be clear; we don\u2019t hate them. We just don\u2019t care for them or to associate with them. MIL has been trying to get us all together by offering to pay for a cruise for us to make amends, but me and my partner said no thank you but appreciated the offer. ",
