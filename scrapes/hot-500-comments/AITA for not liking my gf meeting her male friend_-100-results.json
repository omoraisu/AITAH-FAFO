      "selftext": "So just for more context, I don't have an issue with gf meeting any of her other friends (male or female) except for this one dude. He and I have never really got along - not sure why I just get bad vibes from the dude. Well I clearly don't like the guy as he tried to straight up ask my gf out while we are dating and she rejected him. It's just the thought of him meeting my gf alone and then hanging out triggers me. And I've tried to explain this to my gf multiple times.\n\nBut regardless, they have continued to be friends as they're part of the same friend group. Now I've asked my gf multiple times to distance herself from this guy - but the issue is she's worried as, he's always part of the group and if she doesn't meet them, they'll start distancing her out of the group. Am I being selfish by asking her to stop meeting them if he's around?",
