      "selftext": "Tw: mentions of ocd\n\nBasically, I sit next to a girl in history who I don't know very well. I have Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, which is a shitty disorder, and I'm not gonna go into specifics here, but basically one of my compulsions is that I'm constantly using hand sanitiser on my hands after I touch people/stuff, or I clean my things after they've touched other things. It's pretty bad, and affects me quite a lot.\n\nSo, she's picked up on my constant sanitising, and asked my about it,  to which I said was none of her business, because it isn't. I thought she'd just leave me alone after, cus honestly any decent person would. But then she kept asking about it, mocking me to her friends, and keeps touching me and my stuff, despite it clearly bothering me, for like the whole of this school term. \n\nAnyway last lesson she was really awful to me, and I'd had a shit day, the intrusive thoughts were relentless and I just wanted to get through last periods history lesson and go home. But of course not, because she kept fucking taking my things, and laughing about how I kept sanitising again and again. I wanted to cry, and I just snapped. I stood up, basically yelled at her that she was an ignorant fucking c*nt who should keep her useless mouth shut. I also said a couple other nasty things, before I walked out and slammed the door shut. \n\nThe teacher caught up with me, yelled a bit and send me to the head teachers office. My parents were called and were furious, and keep telling me that my mental illness isn't an excuse to be rude. IMO she had it coming and I don't feel and at all, but they want me to apologise, and I've got like 3 detentions next week, despite explaining the situation. Anyway, yeah, should I apologise?",
