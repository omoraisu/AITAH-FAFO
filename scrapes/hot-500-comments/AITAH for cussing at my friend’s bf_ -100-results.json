      "selftext": "Before I start, I have to say  that this is quite a long story so brace yourselves lol\n\nSo I (19F) have a very close friend, let\u2019s call her Nora (19F) who recently started dating a guy, let\u2019s call him Jack (19M) that she met at her school. Nora and Jack have been going steady for a couple of months now. When they first started getting to know each other my friend asked for my help to meet up with Jack and even invited me to come. I at first didn\u2019t want to go because I thought it was a date but she told me it was just a hang out between friends and that she wanted me to meet this guy and see how I felt about him. My friend has quite strict parents so I decided to help her plan it in a way where her parents thought it was just me and her studying. At first he seemed like an ok guy and I had no complaints about him or his personality. But then things started going downhill. We went to a store because he said he needed some things for the activity we would be doing and upon arriving he was quite rude to the employees and made Nora pay for the things he needed. I was in shock but honestly I didn\u2019t know if there was anything I could do about it. Once we arrived to the place he started acting different and was lowly being rude to me and making me carry lots of things up a hill even tho I told him I had a bad knee due to a past knee injury and an injury on my hand. My friend tried to help me out but he seemed to think it was all fun and games. During this walk he kept trying to pressure my friend to say the N word even after she said no because that wasn\u2019t right (we are Mexican) and I am not 100% sure but I thought I heard him say a slur usually directed towards Latino ppl (B***er) but I thought I may have heard wrong so I kinda just moved on but it was always in the back of my mind. During the time I spent with him I just knew he was kinda off and I just sort of tried to stay to the side and let Jack  interact with Nora. He kept on saying weird things like \u201cI could commit crazy crimes on you guys and nobody would know or find you guys because we\u2019re in such a secluded area\u201d and immediately I had a weird feeling about this guy. I ended up leaving early because we could t take it any much longer. Since Nora\u2019s mother thought she was with me after a while I told Nora to head home at a reasonable time so that she wouldn\u2019t get caught by her parents and she told me she would and she would swing back by my place to get some things she left behind and she sent me Jacks phone number saying that her phone battery was low and if I need to reach her that I should text jacks number. It was starting to get late and Nora\u2019s mother started texting me asking to speak to Nora and asking if I could tell her it was time to head back home. I didn\u2019t text back because obviously I wasn\u2019t with Nora. I texted Jack what Nora\u2019s mother has said and at first he ignored me. After about 2 more texts Nora called me from jacks phone and said she would head back soon to grab her stuff and go home. More time passes and it gets late and I\u2019m still waiting but eventually she grabs her stuff and head home but it\u2019s late so I\u2019m worried she might get caught but she didn\u2019t. The next day she called me and asked what I thought and I am honest with her and say I didn\u2019t really get a first good impression of him. She agrees that it was not good and even thinks about ghosting him but didn\u2019t. This is where things get bad. She begins lying more to her parents to go hang out with Jack and it got to a point where she wouldn\u2019t tell us that she told her parents she was with us but was actually with Jack and we would be confused when her mother would call or text us asking where she was at and we had no idea where she was at. She also starts lying to me and our other friends (we have a very tight knit friend group that consists of 3 other girls, 1 guy, and me) about when she would hang out with him, what would happen when she was with him, and even their relationship status. They started dating and she told all of our friends except me and one other girl, she lied to us and said they were still just talking and I had to find out through one of our other friends when they said something about it and they didn\u2019t know that I didn\u2019t know. We all eventually compared all the different things we were told and found out all the lies she had told us and the different versions that everyone was told about what was going on. I did being it up to her and so had my other friends but we honestly just let it slide because we figured since this was her first relationship and first everything she was still figuring things out. We agreed to not tell anymore lies regarding her relationship and that if she just didn\u2019t feel like telling us that was ok but there was no need to lie. We also agreed that she wouldn\u2019t lie to her parents about who she was with anymore because we didn\u2019t want to be part of the lies anymore. \n\nFast forward to about a couple of months ago she\u2019s still lying about many things to the point where me and my friends are starting to lose trust in her. Her relationship with her parents is deteriorating due to her lies and the fact that they do not approve of her boyfriend for reasons that I personally do not agree with. \nOne day, I receive an Instagram DM from Nora\u2019s account that said \u201cFuck you\u201d. I was confused and thought maybe she was just playing around so I clicked on the chat and it had been deleted I sent a message back saying \u201cI saw that lol\u201d and she said \u201coh that was my bf that said that\u201d and I was confused on why he thought it was ok to say that to me since he knows I don\u2019t particularly like him so I matched his energy and said \u201cBitch fuck you too\u201d and went on about my day being mad at the fact that he had the audacity to speak to me like that. That day u called Emily but she was busy hanging out with him so all k told her was to have fun and make sure that he got my message cuz I wasn\u2019t playing around. We didn\u2019t speak again until about 2 days later when he called me \n\n\nTo paraphrase the call she basically said \u201cI didn\u2019t like how you disrespect my man, he was just trying to play around and you should t have said anything. I don\u2019t care if you\u2019re mad at him for how he spoke to you I\u2019m mad because you hurt his feelings\u201d. I was in shock and I hung up in her face because honestly I could not believe she had just said that to me. She completely ignored my feelings and tried to make me look like the bad guy. She then texted me asking if I was ok and I said no and told her that I would need some time and distance because all of this was outrageous to me. Since then we did try to talk things out and I tried to explain to her that everything that she and Jack have been doing lately is not ok and I wasn\u2019t no part of it but she just doesn\u2019t understand and simply just wants to flip things on me. I have told her that I am upset that we are having a disagreement over some dumb guy and I really did treasure our friendship quite a lot since we\u2019ve been friends since elementary school but if she didn\u2019t feel the same then that\u2019s on her and that I wasn\u2019t going to sit here and argue with her, once she is open to calmly discuss everything and apologize I would be here. All of my friends agree with everything I said and are disappointed in Nora but I have told them that I don\u2019t want them to pick a side or distance themselves from her because of me since this is between me and Nora and jack only. They have also tried talking to her on their own but they are also worried that everything is going in one ear and directly out the other. I\u2019m still in shock that she is doing all of this from a guy that doesn\u2019t even treat her well (I can go into specifics if people would like me tho about this) and I know that her boyfriend has had some influence in her sudden changes. \n\nIf anyone has any advice on what to do or would like me to go into more detail I would but AITAH?
