      "selftext": "So hi sorry if i have bad grammar english isn't my first language so I'm sorry if this turns out horrible \n\nIm female (21) my boyfriend (24) me and my boyfriend have a pretty normal sex life until recently, on Dec 4th my boyfriend and i were having intimacy until he asked me if i wanna do one of his kinks. I really don't like kinks but i said fine because i thought it would be pretty normal until i asked him whats it about, he replied saying that i should just lay on the ground and act like \"nothing was happening while we were having intimacy\" i immediately said no because it felt like it was a \"free use kink\" which i hate because its weird and it made me feel pretty grossed out, he got pretty mad yelling at me saying \"if you cant handle a fucking kink then don't ask about it.\" And he stormed out going to a hotel he returned home and he started distancing himself from me and he also started sleeping on our guess bedroom and he also started ignoring me and yesterday we had a talk and he started blaming me for getting weirded out and said i needed to apologize. I said no and that it was weird af to ask me to do that. So am i the asshole ",
