      "selftext": "I do not feel like I\u2019m wrong but my mom and my sister say I am being invalidating and insensitive to her friends fear so I wanted to post here for objective opinions.\n\nI (25F) live alone with just my dog \u201cBaja\u201d. He is a 4 year old English mastiff/ Cane Corso mix and he weighs 175 lbs. He is huge and literally the biggest baby ever. He has never even growled at anyone and I\u2019ve had him since he was a baby. Because my dog is so big I turned my balcony in my condo into a yard for him. He has room to run and play out there and kinda do his own thing. I have a smart dog door that allows to come in and out as he pleases but I can lock it if I need him to stay out there. I have a small window on the door so I can see him while he\u2019s out there. This is important for the story. \n\nMy sister(30F) who I will call \u201cEva\u201d, asked if she could come over to hang out for a bit and obviously I said yes. When she got here she had a friend with her. She didn\u2019t give me a heads up and I was irritated but I have met the friend before so I brushed it off but told her we\u2019d talk about this later. We will call the friend \u201cSarah.\u201d When we got up to the main floor Baja was laying on the couch and he perked up and started doing his little excited tippy taps when he saw Eva . Eva immediately greeted Baja and was giving him kisses all over his face which he loves. Sarah started immediately hyperventilating when she saw Baja and said he was a killer. I said he wasn\u2019t but offered to put him outside and lock his door while we visit. She asked me if I minded and I said no he liked being out there. I put Baja outside then we all sat on the couch and started chatting. \n\nSarah would not stop staring at Baja. He was literally laying in the sun asleep and she kept watching him with this wide eyed scared expression. Eva asked if she was okay. Sarah asked me if I minded putting Baja in his crate. I told her he didn\u2019t have one because if I leave the house for long periods he\u2019s with me. She then started ranting about how irresponsible that was, that he could hurt people from being left out, that he was violent and obviously dangerous, and that he would probably attack strangers on the street. I told her none of those things were true and he\u2019s my dog and this is how I choose to care for him. She said she had a phobia of big dogs and couldn\u2019t function with him around. I told her that maybe they she should hang at my sister\u2019s place instead because she was so scared. Sarah was offended but she didn\u2019t say anything just gave me a dirty look then Eva a look. Eva was trying to convince Sarah that he couldn\u2019t get in without my unlocking it but she was convinced that Baja was waiting outside to kill her. I told them I was gonna take him on a walk and they left shortly after.\n\nThe next day when I was at my moms, Eva jumped down my throat about invalidating Sarah. She said I could\u2019ve locked Baja in my room or something because Sarah has a phobia of dogs. I told her that Baja lived there and they didn\u2019t and if they didn\u2019t like it they didn\u2019t have to come back. My mom said it wouldn\u2019t have been a big deal to lock him away for a few hours and that I could\u2019ve been more sensitive. I left shortly after because honestly they can complain all they want. I\u2019m not locking my dog in a room when he was secured in his area. So AITA?\n",

If you know someone has a dog, don't go to their house. If the owner makes a reasonable accomodation, you either accept it or leave without making it the owner's issue.\n\nYou accomodated her phobia.
