      "selftext": "Before anything else, I'd like to warn anyone who happens to stumble upon this post that English is not my first languages, so I apologise for any mistake. English is a Safe language for me, to do venting.\nI made the account for this.\n\nThere's more details which I'm willing to give some if asked, but I didn't want to write a lot because I actually want to get advice.\n\nI (15F), have been mad at my father for around the last 3 years.\nThrough the start of my teenage years have came the realization that one of the things that had been fucking me up, was my father himself.\n\nFor context, I've had a few mental struggles practically since I have memory. Going from thing as subtle as moving, to Bullying and the grief of losing a close loved one. I have been working through all of this, mostly by myself. I started going to the school Therapist not so long ago. I've had just 2 sessions. But the point I'm doing my best to get better.\n\nOne of the things, as I said, fucking up this progress is My father himself. For example, through my Journey to be Clean from S.H Which is the reason I go to therapy for. He would say rude comments in a honey manner about my body hair, my weight (I'm not fat, I'm 1,55 m and weight 55 kg. But I'm still ashamed of my physical state). And I would cut over it. He would generate insecurities on me through cruel 'jokes', and then laugh about it when I got upset, stating that I was already mad. (I wasn't, I was sad). \n\nThis keeps happening and it's really taking a toll into my mental health.\n\nBut two years ago it was worse. As I said, I've faced Bullying my entire life, for different reasons. At 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14 years old. Three separate cases. But this one takes place through my ages 12 and 13.\nMy father was jobless. Since he never completed middle School and he works in something we call \"Zafra\" and \"Changas\". I don't know the Word for it, but basically it's and unstable job that happens only a certain part of the year and only if an employer calls him. So, he was home ALL day. By that year, he caught a Call of Duty. . . Maybe even addiction? Let's just say he's played for hours everyday, almost every single day, for the last 3 years. Staying up late to play.\n\nNow, that year was the worst of it. He was home ALL day. He would wake up, play, only drop it to cook, and then keep playing. Mom would be working. I suspect that Game, and poor sleeping habit was the cause of him being so stressed up all the time. Because that year, he yelled at me every single day, multiple times a day, for the dumbest things ever. Now, I remind you, I was getting bullied at School. And I came back Home, only to get yelled at for everything I did and didn't do. \n\nI was never Safe. Not a School, not at Home. I started singning into a lot of extracurriculars. Now, I liked the activities, but being away from Home? Hell yeah, sign me up.\n\nEvery single scold, started developing a small fire in me. Burning with hate towards him, that he kept on making grown bigger with every cruel joke, with every favouritism detail, with every insult while he was mad, and everytime he yelled or complained to or about me.\n\nNow I can't ignore it. I feel uncomfortbale every time he touches me. He put his arm around my shoulder the other day and I felt a disgusting feeling. I ignore him as much as I can and it makes him mad. He feels entitled to my love.\nOne time he hugged me, and told me he loved me, thing which he hadn't done in YEARS, and I mean YEARS, not just 2 but about 5 or 6 years. I said I love you back, simply to end it and not be mean. Yet I felt no love, I only felt uncomfortable.\n\nI am a very loving person towards those I care about, and it shows with my mom. I constantly hug her, tell her I love her, do my best treat her with respect, listen to her, answer her texts which I almost don't do with my father, share candy with her because I know she likes it, etc, etc. And he hates that he doesn't get the same treatment. But I just. . . don't feel any love towards him. \n\nAITA for this? ",
