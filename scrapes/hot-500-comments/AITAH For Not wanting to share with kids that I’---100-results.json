      "selftext": "Maybe it\u2019s just something I need to process. We are a blended family and my SD mom and SS mom both talk gossip about everything. I\u2019m a private person and felt when we made the decision for me to be a SAHM, I didn\u2019t really feel comfortable sharing and husband was/is still in a custody battle over SS. \n\nAm I that wrong to want to just keep it on the DL. I wouldn\u2019t ask a child to lie, so as the adult, I choose not to disclose it. But I know for a fact SD would end up sharing this information. Then it\u2019ll go around and again maybe just my anxiety and being a private person. Not sure how to handle it. It\u2019s been months already, but she pushes to ask what I do at times and it gets uneasy and I\u2019ve already given an answer. SD is 11. I wouldn\u2019t really care about my kiddo sharing to his dad but for some reason it really bothers me to share on the other side. \n\nOn the fence with husband about this. \n\nTd:LR- I don\u2019t want to share with SD about me being a SAHM to avoid gossiping that will ensue, I\u2019m a private person, husband on the fence, idk how to think or feel about it. Wouldn\u2019t ask a kid to lie so I choose not to disclose. Blended family. ",
