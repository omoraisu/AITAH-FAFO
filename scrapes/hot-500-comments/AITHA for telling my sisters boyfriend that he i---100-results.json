      "selftext": "So I (f21) have an older sister Samantha (f26) and her boyfriend who is (m24) let's call him tavion (since that's literally his name lol) I found out from my other sister Natalie that Tavion left her and their kids about 2 months ago. I was planning on staying with her until she could find out what to do. Then Tavion came back out of the blue last week. After two months or probably more away. I was furious. I still am furious. Me and my sisters had a birthday party for my nephew who is now 7 years old. I didn't speak to him the whole time I was there. \n\nI talked to my two other sisters Natalie and Kaylynn and I also played tag and hide and go seek with the kids outside. I talked to Kaylynn's boyfriend and Natalie's baby daddy but didn't talk to Tavion. He was very upset the whole day. I'm a very talkative person cause of my sucky childhood. I didn't even talk to my sister Samantha tbh. \n\nBefore they left Tavion asked me why I didn't talk to them but everyone else. I told him the truth that to me he abandoned their kids and left my sister. And to me you don't do that. Leaving my sister is whatever you want to do but to abandoned your kids is fucked up and we grew up with a dad who was in and out of our lives and still is. And we want more for our kids. He told me I don't understand what it's like to be a parent and I told him stright up that I help them with literally everything. \n\nThey need food? You call me.\nThey need school supplies? You call me. \nThey need anything from anywhere? You call me. \n\nHeck they all call me their second mother. He told me he needed a break. I told him stright up that what he did was abandoned his kids not take a week or even a weekend away but he stayed two months away that to me is not a break. I also asked him what about my sister Sam she doesn't get a break. He told me she doesn't need one. I called bullshit and then he told me he still counts me as a little sister and that he loves me as one. I told him he was honestly nothing to me except my sisters boyfriend. He got mad and called me an asshole. I called him a punk ass boy who needs to grow up and that you don't get a break from being a parent until all of them turn 18 or even 20. \n\nSam asked me to let it go since she did. I told her just cause you let it go didn't mean I have to. That he abandoned his kids and that's something I can never forget. I told Tavion that he won't ever be my brother again. And he got upset. I told my sisters if they ever need a break to bring them to my house for the weekend and I'll take care of them until Sunday night but to not abandon their kids. And that goes to their boyfriends aswell.\n\nSo am I the asshole for telling my sisters boyfriend that he isn't my brother anymore after he abandoned his kids?\n",
