      "selftext": "First of all, Please forgive me for bad English. English isn't my first language.\n\nSo I (28F) and my husband (36M) got married last year.\n\nOriginally, I wasn't even wanting to do a wedding. However, wedding is really important in his culture so I agreed to have one small reception and religious ceremony for marriage just with our direct family members. (He is from South Asia and I'm from Eastern Asia)\n\nWe had a destination wedding so everyone took flight from their own countries. Here's the first drama. I worked as a flight attendant so I issued discounted tickets for everyone. This is basically standby tickets. If airline has empty seats, you can get a seat. Most of time you need to wait until the last moment to get to know if you'll get seat or not but the deal is 90% off so we just quietly wait. Other than waiting, there's some other conditions to use the tickets, one of which was to be polite with the airline stuffs. If the person who use my ticket misbehaved, I will be the one responsible and worst case, I can get fired. I already told everyone about the condition. Everyone seemed understanding but brother in law (45M, I'll call him James) was making comments like \"Why can I not get a confirmation?\" etc but I just blushed off as I was really busy that time.\n\nFast forward to the day we all left. I got a call from sister in law (33F, she is a wife of James and sister of my husband. I'll call her Susan) crying on the phone. They went to the airport but they're coming from the destination which is always busy so ground stuff told them to wait until most of customers finish checkin. Somewhat that made James upset and started to fight with ground stuff so now the stuff is threatening them to report this to the company. I immediately asked her to let me speak with the stuff and I explained them a situation and apologized. The stuff understood the situation so they didn't make it big of deal and gave them a seats in the end. This was the first drama.\n\nSecond drama happened the day before my reception day. Each one of families had their own plans to stay in the destination. Some of them just stay for few days but others stayed for over a week. James decided to stay for a week which wasn\u2019t bad if he would've just attended the wedding and a little sightseeing nearby. But he somewhat booked 3 days trip with Susan to another city of the country. The city he tried to visit is really far from the convention that they need to take a flight to go. He dropped this bomb and we all were mad. But he insisted to go and won't cancel it since it's non refundable. And what even worse is they have 2 children (2 years old and 4 years old) but he refused to take them since it's a child free trip. Susan claimed she didn't know about it and began crying. After hours of back and forth fight, my mother in law took decisions to babysit the children meanwhile they go on the trip just for the sake of finishing the drama. Apparently that makes hard for James to stay in the room with us, so he left. I was wondering what about Susan cancel the trip and take care of the children since it's her own children and was claiming she was unaware of the trip. But she insisted that if she won't come with him, he'll divorce her so she needs to come with him. I felt weird about it but everyone treated her as victim so I didn't push.\n\nNext day was our reception. Besides James drama, I had a huge problem with my makeup artist and driver so before even reaching to convention, I was already tired. But once I entered, I noticed something is wrong. I saw Susan was crying again. So the reason of her tears this time was her children were fussy and James weren't helpful so she can't enjoy the wedding. Everyone from in law side gave her an attention including my husband. At that point, I detached myself from the reality. I just focused on the food and ate like pig to distract myself from the mess. I wish I could cry but I didn't want my parents to worried about me, so I held tears. (My family wasn't there when James drama was happening and I didn't tell them to save my husband\u2019s faces)\n\nWe had religious wedding ceremony on the next day. It called nikkah which is Islamic marriage. We went to mosque to complete it. It required to have 2 witnesses for both bride and groom. And this mosque had a regulations that besides witnesses, only 2 guests can be there. So that makes excluding Susan. But James, mother in law, brother in law couple (husband's brother) and all of nephews and nieces were excluded as well. Yes, you guessed right. She started to cry again and even after we finish nikkah, she was crying.\n\nJames and Susan went on the lovely trip the next day and came back after 3 days. They supposed to land around 9 AM but no one got contact from them. We just thought maybe their flight delays or something. NO! We got a call few hours later from them saying they haven't seeing tourists area nearby convention yet so they've joined tour so they won't come back until night. Honestly, I was too tired to react this nonsense. Thinking nothing makes me surprised about them. Until we got an another call from Susan later on that day. Apparently police asked James to show ID and he stupidly refused. And shouting at police that he's American and he can do anything so he was about to sent police station. My nephew is native to the language of the country so he convinced police to let him go and somewhat they managed to not to get arrested.\n\nAt this point, I did not want to do anything with James and Susan. I told James that i don't want him to use discounted tickets under my name since he almost took my job away. But he started to cry and beg me to not to do it and as you can imagine Susan joined so I felt pressure from my in law family to not to do it. So I ended up letting him use it.\n\nMy husband's family bond are strong in both good way and bad way. After all these drama, they blindly believe Susan is the victim of the situation and James is the only villain here. I strongly disagree with it but I keep it in my heart since we all live in different countries so I don't expect to see them next anytime soon. That's what I thought. But nowadays, in laws are asking me to visit Susan and James since I'm still flight attendant and also has passport which doesn't required visa to enter US. I used my husband not having US visa as an excuse, but he got visa now so I don't have much excuse anymore. Honestly, if I need to see them again any time soon, I'd be end up in jail lol\n\nI told my husband that I wasn't mentally ready to see them but he seems like thinking I wasn't serious.\n\nI feel like I'm holding a grudge too long now.\n\nSo AITAH?\n\n\n",
