      "selftext": "Title: AITA for refusing to meet my daughter\u2019s new boyfriend and missing her secret wedding?\n\nI have a daughter who has been through an incredibly rough time with severe depression and mental health Over the past 18 months, she has attempted suicide twice. The second attempt was so severe that she ended up in intensive care on a ventilator. After that, she moved back home with us for 8 months, needing constant financial and emotional support to recover and stabilize.\n\nEventually, she managed to get a work-from-home job, found her own apartment, and started to rebuild her independence. I was so proud of her for taking those steps forward. But within a month of moving out, she met a guy. She told me he was \u201cthe ONE\u201d almost immediately.\n\nGiven everything she had been through, I wasn\u2019t thrilled about her rushing into a new relationship so soon. She has had many boyfriends in the past, and it seemed too quick for her to make such a big claim after only a month of knowing him. I told her I wasn\u2019t ready to meet him yet and suggested she give it six months. I wanted to make sure this relationship was stable and that she was in a good place emotionally before getting involved.\n\nToday, she dropped a bombshell: she secretly married this guy two months ago, after knowing him for just one month. She told me they had a private ceremony with no one else there. As her only parent (and she\u2019s my only daughter), I felt completely blindsided and heartbroken.\n\nTo make things worse, I called my own mother for support, and she told me she already knew about the wedding! She claimed she didn\u2019t tell me because she didn\u2019t want to betray my daughter\u2019s trust. But I feel so betrayed myself. If I\u2019d known, I absolutely would\u2019ve been there to support my daughter and see her get married.\n\nWhen I told my daughter how disappointed I was, she said it\u2019s my fault I missed out because I didn\u2019t want to meet her boyfriend early on. She made it seem like my hesitation to meet him meant I didn\u2019t care, but that couldn\u2019t be further from the truth. I just wanted her to take things slow and focus on herself before jumping into something new.\n\nAfter all we\u2019ve been through\u2014supporting her emotionally, financially, and in every other way\u2014this feels like such a slap in the face.\n\nTo top it off, I\u2019m also really upset with my mother for not sticking up for me or encouraging my daughter to tell me about the wedding. I feel like she should\u2019ve had my back instead of keeping such a huge secret from me.\n\nSo, AITA for setting boundaries and saying I didn\u2019t want to meet her boyfriend right away? And am I wrong to be pissed at my own mother for not encouraging my daughter to tell me about the wedding?",
