      "selftext": "So my gf has an exposition from time to time with handmade stuff she creates. Stuffed animals,..\n\nAfter one of the expositions a guy contacted her on instagram asking if he could somehow make his own stuffed animal with her.\n\nMy gf also said it was a bit of a weird request but they stayed in touch talking about some random stuff from time to time.\n\nNow the guy asked again if they could meet up at our place to chat and maybe do some DIY together.\n\nMy girlfriend who first thought it was weird, would now like to meet up with him and \u201cmake new friends\u201d\n\nMe and my GF aren\u2019t the most social types, we have our close group of friends that we\u2019ve had since before we\u2019ve been together(3years) and we regularly meet with them but we haven\u2019t really made a lot of new friends.\n\nMy GF already mentioned a couple times that she has a partner.\n\nNo drama has been made and I wanted to post here to know if i\u2019m overprotective or overreacting or if this is indeed strange.\n\nLet me know..\n\n\n\nUPDATE: We talked about it because I know we have a solid relationship and I can trust her. \n\nIt\u2019s new for me that she meets with other guys as she doesn\u2019t have a lot of male friends and i\u2019ve met all of them before.\n\nI know i\u2019m worried because of my own insecurities of \u201cnot being good enough\u201d but that shouldn\u2019t get in the way of her social life and she is allowed to have friends, obviously.\n\nI told her that i\u2019m okay with it as long as I can be at home too. Not forcing myself in the same room but just minding my own business and will join the conversation when the opportunity presents itself (the hobby room right now is the kitchen so I need to go there to get a drink/snack either way)\n\nShe acknowledged that it may be a bit weird but on the other hand, it\u2019s not too crazy to think that after buying something handmade from my girlfriend for two years in a row this person is legitimately interested in how it\u2019s made and wants to try it for himself. \n\nAt the end of the day we\u2019re both still young, 25, and will meet a lot of new people throughout our life/carreer/hobbies so it\u2019s only natural that we will cross paths with new people and make new friends along the way (atleast let\u2019s hope). Situations similar to this will be inevitable and we have to trust eachother and work on our relationship to make it work. Every day you actively choose to be with and stay with your partner, regardless of the people you meet. (Untill you don\u2019t anymore but let\u2019s not talk about that)\n",
