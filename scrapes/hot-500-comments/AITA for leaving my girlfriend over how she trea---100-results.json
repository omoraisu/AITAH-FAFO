      "selftext": "I (25 F), have been in a relationship with my girlfriend (24F), for about 7 months now. I'm a lesbian, and I'm out to my family, and I thought my girlfriend was too. She told me they were accepting, but that they didnt know about me yet, and that she would have to tell them soon. This was our first Thanksgiving together, and we decided to visit her family for Thanksgiving instead of mine, since I had already introduced her to my family but I hadn't been introduced to hers. \n\nShe seemed very wary of me going to Thanksgiving, and I asked her if they were accepting, and she said yes, but that they would take a while to warm up to me. I brushed it off as nervousness, but I did not know the extent of what I was about to get myself into. \n\nWe agreed on this a few weeks before Thanksgiving, and the day finally comes. She picks me up, we get to her parents house, and suddenly she brushes off any affection I try to give her. No kiss before we get out of the car, she rejects me holding her hand as we walk in, and she can barely make eye contact with me. At this point, im anxious, unsure of if I have done something wrong. Everything is made clear as I walk through the door and see her parents for the first time ever in person. \n\nThey say that I must be the *friend* that my girlfriend told them about. I look to my girlfriend, confused as hell, and she gives me the most apologetic look she can muster. The whole night goes by in a blur, as my girlfriend avoids my confused, upset, and angry looks. Her family are all convinced that I'm just a friend of hers, yet she doesn't correct them. She brushes me off, and I try to keep myself together and put on a brave face so I don't make a scene. \n\nAfter the night was over, I asked what that situation was. I told her she lied to me, and told me that her family was accepting and that she would tell them about me. She said, and I quote, \"yeah, but I didn't say when I would tell them we were together.\" This made me very angry, and i told her that she could find another girlfriend that is willing to be led on and that if she can't tell her family about me, then it's obvious this isn't worthy of a long term commitment. I felt lied to, blindsided, and led on. \n\nFor the past week, I've been a mess. Some of my friends say that I shouldn't have blown up like that, and that maybe she panicked and lied, and word spread, but I don't know. I feel like she could have at least told me. \n\nSo, AITA? \n\nTLDR: Girlfriend doesn't tell her family that she has a girlfriend, leading me to walk in on her families Thanksgiving unknowing that I'm supposed to act like a \"friend.\" ",

There was no good reason to blindside you like that. Would you have been angry if she just simply told you that she wasn\u2019t ready to come out to her family? Even if you were upset about that, surely she would know that introducing you and treating you as a \u201cfriend\u201d would not only guarantee your anger but possibly end the relationship. </p>\n\n<p>I was initially thinking that you both could resolve this with a talk, but when I read that she said that \u201cyeah, but I didn\u2019t say when I would tell them\u201d, she lost me.

When we started dating, it was a major problem for myself and my family, but I have come to understand that it is okay if she doesn't want to tell them. I am out and have been where she is not. We live far from either family, so we don't see them much, which helps. In my opinion, as long as we are happy together I don't mind that her family doesn't know. But it would be the lying that would break me. I can live with ommission not lying. Her telling you the knew and then basically ghosting you in live action would be horrible.",
