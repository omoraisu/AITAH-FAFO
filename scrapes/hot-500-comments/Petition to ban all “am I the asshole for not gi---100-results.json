But individual subs can still have the lifecycle happen, I think if it's niche enough. A lot of not-so-niche subs have been co-opted though.

BPT used to be amazing but it's maybe 1 in 20 posts like the old BPT now.\n\nLinkedIn meanwhile, every fucking post is \"I tied my shoe this morning, here are 5 things I learned about running a business from doing that\" type bullshit and I couldn't tell you one interesting post I've seen on there in months, while I still see interesting stuff on Reddit daily. And pretty much every group is riddled with content spam mixed with plain ol' spam - no discussion whatsoever. It used to be an amazing place to do business and it's just terrible now.\n\nSo overall I honestly can't really complain about Reddit. Certainly there's some enshitification - there used to be much more awesome snark and sarcasm throughout that would just make it an overall hilarious place and now, IMO the only truly funny subs left on Reddit are the sports subs where that spirit is still kept alive, part of why sports media gets fueled so much by Reddit at this point. I see clever comebacks daily there and can't remember the last truly clever comeback I saw on clevercomebacks. And there used to be some great humor on niche meme subs (youdontsurf used to be amazing in the early days for instance) but most things have given way to the bigger meme subs and they're just okay. And then you see what happens with serious but interesting niche subs like AITAH - great for some time but just eventually runs its course.",
