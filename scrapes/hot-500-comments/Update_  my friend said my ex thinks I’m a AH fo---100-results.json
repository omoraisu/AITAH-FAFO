      "selftext": "So I bumped into my friend. I tried to pass them and make out like I didn\u2019t see him. But he walked right over to me. \n\nHe apologised to me for what he said. He said it wasn\u2019t his business and that he was wrong thinking I was being babyish. After thinking on it he said he totally understood why I didn\u2019t message him when he didn\u2019t have the decency to reach out after my parents died. He said he was a dick for saying that. \n\nSo I asked him what he knew about the break up. My ex told him I was being stroppy and I wasn\u2019t interested in sex anymore. So I told him the actual reasons we broke up, the fact I was SA and he didn\u2019t like another man put his hands on me and he was sexting other girls which is true, but considering what happened is it really surprising I\u2019d lost interest in sex. His face completely changed. He looked horrified. Told me how sorry he was I went through all that. He gave me a hug. Just before we parted ways he said he was going to reconsider his friendship with the ex. If he couldn\u2019t stand by the side and support the woman he supposedly loved after the SA and then wonder why I\u2019d lost interest in sex then he\u2019s probably not the best to be friends with. I thanked him for being understanding and wished him a lovely Christmas if I didn\u2019t see him before. He apologised again for being a dick. \n\nSo at least the friend apologised and the ex is a even bigger dick than I thought before talking to him. \n\nOriginal post. \n\nFor context I 42f and my ex 42m were close after we split up. We split up about 6 years ago. We split up due to a lot of things. I got really depressed after I was SA and that mixed with him sexting other women put a strain on our relationship. After 5 years together he broke up with me via text. He told me couldn\u2019t deal with my depression and the fact another man put his hands on me. \n\nHis new gf who\u2019s 8 years younger, she hated the fact we were still friends, she was very jealous. So me and the ex drifted apart. I respect that he wanted to put the new relationship with her first before our relationship and I was happy for him. \n\nAnyway. Both of my parents died in the space of a year of each other. He definitely knew as our mutual friend told him he confirmed that he\u2019d seen on Facebook about the funeral arrangements. I didn\u2019t get a text or call of condolences from him which again is fine. I didn\u2019t expect a call or text from him as we\u2019ve drifted apart. \n\nI recently saw on Facebook he\u2019s had a baby with his gf. I\u2019m happy for him. But as we haven\u2019t spoken or text or wanted to rock the boat with his gf I didn\u2019t text him or say anything on his Facebook announcement. I saw a mutual friend who told me that I was being babyish and jealous by not texting him or saying anything on Facebook. So told our mutual friend while I\u2019m very happy for him that things worked out for him and he has a baby, as he couldn\u2019t even be bothered to text after both my parents died, why should I feel obligated to congratulate him on his new baby and that I didn\u2019t want to cause any issues as being new parents is a very difficult time. \n\nSo am I being babyish? \n\nEdit: \nThank you all for your feedback. I\u2019m glad that you all helped me realise I\u2019m not being \u201cbabyish\u201d. After my parents dying I\u2019m second guessing everything and all my decisions. Looking back  over the years he gaslighted me a lot, made me believe his BS, made me insecure. All reasons why I stopped texting him and we drifted apart. \n\nI don\u2019t know if the friend actually knows what the ex is really like and the reasons why we split up. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me if he lied about it. If he lied to me about so many things, who knows what he tells others about the relationship. The friend was his bestie while we were together. He even tried to get us to get back together as he thought we made a good couple. \n\nWhile I\u2019m happy for him I\u2019m also glad he\u2019s out of my life. After the split my Dad told me he never really liked him anyway. Dad always did know best \ud83e\udd72. \n\nEDIT 2 To clarify I missed the part where the ex thinks I\u2019m a AH for not getting in touch with him apparently to him I didn\u2019t coz I\u2019m jealous. Like others here have pointed out it was always about him. The \u201cfriend\u201dthinks I\u2019m babyish. I couldn\u2019t give a flying F what the ex think. Was just more concerned about how others saw me like the \u201cfriend\u201d ",
