      "selftext": "UPDATED: didn\u2019t expect this kind of response! I\u2019m not a troll nor is this fake. I\u2019m not divorcing him. We continued to have a lovely day as a family. I love my husband, he loves me, and we both love and want what\u2019s best for our sons. I guess sometimes it\u2019s just hard being the only girl in the house and not always understanding the way males interact. But that\u2019s what\u2019s beautiful about complementary genders. Hopefully we both pour the best of ourselves into our sons. And when either of us makes a mistake, we own it, apologize, forgive. If we can model that for our boys, in addition to a million other things, maybe we will all be all right. \n\nMy (46F) husband (M50) and I have three sons, ages 14, 9, 9. We were setting up Christmas decorations and having a good time. The kids were going back and forth, teasing their dad and each other with roasts. It\u2019s not my favorite. (I actually hate it, but when everyone else is laughing and not taking it seriously, I let it go\u2026)\n\nThen my husband called one of the boys a girl as a jab. Everyone else laughed. I said, \u201cHoney! No!!\u201d He said, \u201cwhat?!?\u201d I said, \u201cdon\u2019t use my gender as an insult!\u201d He said, \u201cdon\u2019t be so sensitive. We are guys. This is what we do!\u201d\n\nSo, am I overly sensitive? No one else was bothered. But I feel like being female is a beautiful thing and while they may be guys, I\u2019m not. And he chose to marry a not-guy. So why should it be an insult? \n\nAnd there is so much hate and disparagement in the world\u2026why teach our sons to belittle any feature?",

Why? *Because they view them as inferior.*\n\n>Boys are taught that being girly is bad because it makes them \u201cgay\u201d, not masculine, etc. \n\nRight.

I still contend this is different from thinking women are inferior in general. Instead, I\u2019d phrase it that boys think that girly boys are inferior to manly boys.\n\n\u2026yes, and why do they see **GIRLY** boys as inferior?\u2026because they see *girls and women* ***as inferior.*** it\u2019s not different than thinking women are inferior in general.

I just have a hard time believing  that\u2019s the norm.\n\nYou may have a hard time believing it. That doesn\u2019t change the fact that all of this stems from cishet men viewing women as inferior, or society socializing and conditioning them to, ***even when they don\u2019t realize it.***",

I was also a very smart kid that picked up on if ppl were believing what they were saying so I'd ask \"I heard this in school\" and they MIGHT spew the \"right\" answer but I could tell if they were lying to me and themselves.\n\nWell, another thing I remember was a little book we got taught at 7 about how women can be carpenters and men can be nurses and there's no man/woman jobs or tasks. That was bullshit too of course.\n\nThe weird thing is, I grew up in a pretty feminist household though my dad would probably refuse that label. He saw himself as \"a real man, one that can do everything on his own if he had to\" and that included being the only one in our little family who could use a sewing machine. He was proud as fuck about all the money it saved that he'd sew stuff for our boat himself. \n\nHe was also the one that taught my mom to cook and the one I called in the afternoon at work if I needed something since he just had an unimportant manager job and wouldn't have to be rotated out of the OR like my nurse mom. We'd cook together, all three of us, and when my mom had nightshifts, my dad and I went on as normal, just with one less cook. \n\nHe'd also be the one to come get me in my room if I was upset over something and beg me to come talk to them so we could work things out and talk about what had me so upset. \n\nHis big sorrow in life, though he never said it out loud, was that I didn't want to become a hunter. He had mad respect for the female hunters he'd met and saw no problem with me becoming one of them. \n\nWhen I moved out and asked him to come to DIY, he'd semi-refuse. \"No, I won't come hang up your lamps but I'll come show you how to do it\" and then he did the task while I watched and he hoped I'd do it myself the next time. Me being a woman was no excuse for not being able to take care of myself in his book.\n\nStill, with all of this in my life, I was still very aware that being a woman/girl wasn't as good as being a boy and all the rules and expectations society had to us. \n\nI still remember \"the leader\" in my class (he works with kids now, no surprise) who gave us all hell for laughing at a boy crying after being hit in the groin by a football. He yelled loudly that it's OK for boys to cry when hit there because it hurts so insanely bad and we all shut up and nodded, because he made sense and we actually looked up to him, it wasn't bully leadership.",

[...] and I'm rarely wrong when I interpret something thinking the intent from the sender was good and helpful. \n\nWell, my skeptic rationalist instincts scream cherry-picking selection bias and positivity bias, but.\n\nI also know myself to discount the positive of most things, being overly rigid about methods used, or not giving enough due credit, despite valuing fairness.\n\nThis is an outstanding praise. I'm not sure you haven't been too swayed by its compartmentalized and curated nature, but it's your feelings here I'm the most appreciative of here regardless.\n\nThe hint I'd be participating in this positive experience you're having is a **sacred honor** to me; as someone irreligious/anti-religious and who values education, teaching, and learning.\n\nIt's the reason-to-be of every single of the words I've written so far. I can't overstate how important it is to me personally.\n\n>Still, even with my positive expectations of redditors, your first reply was the most constructive and elegant way to say \"I disagree\" I've seen in a long time so I have no doubt you excercise a lot of intent with your vocabulary. \n\nThis might come to a shock to you, but I have no idea what you're describing here, for the three following factors :\n\n * It wasn't a message of disagreement, barely an addition to who I was replying to then. (Was it you ? I forgot, and I can't check while typing this.) I think of it as offering a useful deconstruction for a conceptual conflict on a label. Scholar/academic work.\n * How such a deconstruction can be constructive ? Maybe it's being too much on the nose of my own pages and not seeing the forest for my own trees, but I genuinely have the broader impact of this slipping through my fingers. I think it's yours, now. That I'm merely trying to make minimal industrial customer service for it to you.\n * Elegant how ? Maybe related to my second point's probable shortsightedness. My writing style is purely designed for mechanical functionality of language. I feel like you find it elegant like a caliper, a sextant, or a blacksmithing power hammer. Not graceful inherently, but it's my scientific process of having something shaping up through it that is ... Inspiring to you ? I'm not sure. I don't even know what grace or elegance are.\n\n>I'd really love some pointers, I have a handful of illnesses that all affect my memory and cognitive abilities and on top of that, English is a second language. But I think this was a pretty good cue for me to shut down SoMe for a few hours, my brain is apparently somewhat melted after having had guests for a few hours which makes my normal verbal clumsiness a lot worse.\n\nThree hours straight of socialization. This is my personal best. You're a fellow autistic person.\n\nYou're not clumsy, you're navigating places without being given tours, how to read signs, or what even are the rules to move around.\n\nIt's calling a fish clumsy/useless for being unable to climb a tree in a class of chimpanzees. Put them all in water, and let's discuss the results then.\n\nWhat a better support for you than someone who spent their entire scholarity in ordinary spaces, became perfectly fluent bilingual English later in life, and ambitions to still become an impactful and thought provoking creative writer.\n\nAll I know about language is to give people who never had one, their own voice. It's about communication. That's why I put in the reps, became buff, and still keep at it everyday, after day, after day.\n\n>I do a ton of sudokus daily to make sure my brain is being excercised but I'd really love some extra tips!\n\nIt reminds me of one of my family members I've caught machine-gun tapping at their Majong puzzle game. Pleading \"It's ok, because I'm even giving myself challenges, too !\".\n\nIn both times, I winced wearily. Like for ordinary musculation, you need to reach a level of stress that tells your body there's something to adapt to.\n\nYou'd be plateauing like my family member, which is fine if progress isn't your goal in the first place.

                                        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>I f*cking love reddit ... I&#39;ve just spent time on two threads where I&#39;d misunderstood something/someone and BOTH with ppl that were both patient and kind in their replies. [...] and I&#39;m rarely wrong when I interpret something thinking the intent from the sender was good and helpful. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Well, my skeptic rationalist instincts scream cherry-picking selection bias and positivity bias, but.</p>\n\n<p>I also know myself to discount the positive of most things, being overly rigid about methods used, or not giving enough due credit, despite valuing fairness.</p>\n\n<p>This is an outstanding praise. I&#39;m not sure you haven&#39;t been too swayed by its compartmentalized and curated nature, but it&#39;s your feelings here I&#39;m the most appreciative of here regardless.</p>\n\n<p>The hint I&#39;d be participating in this positive experience you&#39;re having is a <strong>sacred honor</strong> to me; as someone irreligious/anti-religious and who values education, teaching, and learning.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s the reason-to-be of every single of the words I&#39;ve written so far. I can&#39;t overstate how important it is to me personally.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>Still, even with my positive expectations of redditors, your first reply was the most constructive and elegant way to say &quot;I disagree&quot; I&#39;ve seen in a long time so I have no doubt you excercise a lot of intent with your vocabulary. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This might come to a shock to you, but I have no idea what you&#39;re describing here, for the three following factors :</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>It wasn&#39;t a message of disagreement, barely an addition to who I was replying to then. (Was it you ? I forgot, and I can&#39;t check while typing this.) I think of it as offering a useful deconstruction for a conceptual conflict on a label. Scholar/academic work.</li>\n<li>How such a deconstruction can be constructive ? Maybe it&#39;s being too much on the nose of my own pages and not seeing the forest for my own trees, but I genuinely have the broader impact of this slipping through my fingers. I think it&#39;s yours, now. That I&#39;m merely trying to make minimal industrial customer service for it to you.</li>\n<li>Elegant how ? Maybe related to my second point&#39;s probable shortsightedness. My writing style is purely designed for mechanical functionality of language. I feel like you find it elegant like a caliper, a sextant, or a blacksmithing power hammer. Not graceful inherently, but it&#39;s my scientific process of having something shaping up through it that is ... Inspiring to you ? I&#39;m not sure. I don&#39;t even know what grace or elegance are.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I&#39;d really love some pointers, I have a handful of illnesses that all affect my memory and cognitive abilities and on top of that, English is a second language. But I think this was a pretty good cue for me to shut down SoMe for a few hours, my brain is apparently somewhat melted after having had guests for a few hours which makes my normal verbal clumsiness a lot worse.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Three hours straight of socialization. This is my personal best. You&#39;re a fellow autistic person.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;re not clumsy, you&#39;re navigating places without being given tours, how to read signs, or what even are the rules to move around.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s calling a fish clumsy/useless for being unable to climb a tree in a class of chimpanzees. Put them all in water, and let&#39;s discuss the results then.</p>\n\n<p>What a better support for you than someone who spent their entire scholarity in ordinary spaces, became perfectly fluent bilingual English later in life, and ambitions to still become an impactful and thought provoking creative writer.</p>\n\n<p>All I know about language is to give people who never had one, their own voice. It&#39;s about communication. That&#39;s why I put in the reps, became buff, and still keep at it everyday, after day, after day.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I do a ton of sudokus daily to make sure my brain is being excercised but I&#39;d really love some extra tips!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It reminds me of one of my family members I&#39;ve caught machine-gun tapping at their Majong puzzle game. Pleading &quot;It&#39;s ok, because I&#39;m even giving myself challenges, too !&quot;.</p>\n\n<p>In both times, I winced wearily. Like for ordinary musculation, you need to reach a level of stress that tells your body there&#39;s something to adapt to.</p>\n\n<p>You&#39;d be plateauing like my family member, which is fine if progress isn&#39;t your goal in the first place. It can mean mild skill degradation if you don&#39;t even take the opportunities for real-life problem solving and planning you might already have.</p>\n\n<p>My oldest family member turned 93 this year.

I feel sad that so many people don't know how words work and think that it is just automatic filtering kind of problem: that we just remove the word and don't consider context.\n\nThat is stupid and not how it works. You said it yourself \"it was used against me AS AN INSULT\". That is not ok way to use that word. But that does not make the word itself bad. Those who use it to mock people are bad people.\n\nYou.. gave the wrong lecture, not me. You just claimed that all sunshine is bad since too much of it can give us skin cancer.\n\nIn many ways, YOU THINK OF THE WROD RETARDED AS AN INSULT!! Your mind does that. Not mine. YOU put that meaning into that word, you think of it as negative insult when that word has been used for centuries to describe medical condition. YOU need to now deal with YOUR OWN PREJUDICES! And do not come back and talk about how you know, since the topic here is that even WOMEN USE THR WORD \"GIRL\" TO MOCK PEOPLE!! I do admit that this is one of the more difficult things to understand for many, it requires a bit more thinking that most have ever done in their life. It also means hard look inside about YOUR ideas of what words mean. \n\nWe had this discussion not that long ago with disabled people about the word retarded in my native language. Only abled bodied people think it is derogatory. The disabled USE IT THEMSELVES HERE. And i emphasize that there is NO difference in translation. It is accurate word for certain medical conditions that we have used for CENTURIES CORRECTLY. So.. why the fuck does your head think it is bad? Because... assholes? Right?\n\nContext matters. Retarded is NOT the n-word. That one i won't say, it has NO positive or neutral meanings. This is literally how this all works and you not being able to overcome your OWN PREJUDICES ABOUT DISABLED PEOPLE is next.",

I feel sad that so many people don&#39;t know how words work and think that it is just automatic filtering kind of problem: that we just remove the word and don&#39;t consider context.</p>\n\n<p>That is stupid and not how it works. You said it yourself &quot;it was used against me AS AN INSULT&quot;. That is not ok way to use that word. But that does not make the word itself bad. Those who use it to mock people are bad people.</p>\n\n<p>You.. gave the wrong lecture, not me. You just claimed that all sunshine is bad since too much of it can give us skin cancer.</p>\n\n<p>In many ways, YOU THINK OF THE WROD RETARDED AS AN INSULT!! Your mind does that. Not mine. YOU put that meaning into that word, you think of it as negative insult when that word has been used for centuries to describe medical condition. YOU need to now deal with YOUR OWN PREJUDICES! And do not come back and talk about how you know, since the topic here is that even WOMEN USE THR WORD &quot;GIRL&quot; TO MOCK PEOPLE!! I do admit that this is one of the more difficult things to understand for many, it requires a bit more thinking that most have ever done in their life. It also means hard look inside about YOUR ideas of what words mean. </p>\n\n<p>We had this discussion not that long ago with disabled people about the word retarded in my native language.

And (to me more importantly) #2 odds are we might have a son that was LGBTQ,  if that was the case, I would not have any of my sons raised in a home that they believed that their father would not accept and love them. I&#39;ve always picked my battles, but this one was important to me,  and once I made that clear, my husband respected that, even though sometimes he needed a reminder.</p>\n</div>",

Your husband not only needs to stop doing that, he needs to START looking for ways to teach his boys to honor women. We are your doctors, your teachers, your lawyers, your postal service workers, your NASA scientists\u2026 lots of men would be lucky to be \u201cgirlie\u201d</p>\n</div>",
