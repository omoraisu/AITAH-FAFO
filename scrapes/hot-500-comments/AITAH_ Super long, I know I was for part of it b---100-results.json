      "selftext": "I am a school counselor at an elementary school this is year 6 there. I have developed some really good relationships and tend to go above and beyond my counseling duties when I am able. I run things like the school PBIS store once a month and I have helped with some assemblies. I made a video for one PBIS assembly, that was 3 minutes long, to help talk about our focus for the month of responsibility. Admin often comes to me with questions as they are both new. They lean on me for help and support, which I dont mind and value our relationship. It's been a long time since I have had an admin team that is supportive and collaborative. \n\nI have a new cocounselor this year. She is often very long winded and repeats herself, and has been known to corner people and talk to them even after the conversation should be over. We are in education, we don't have a lot of time and need to be quick and intentional often. These are just side notes, she is kind, and a good school counselor. \n\nOur styles of counseling are very different. The kids at school do not see me as admin, I am someone they can joke around with and also come to if they need to talk. I have a great relationship that I have worked so hard to build by being my authentic self.\n\nI have recently noticed that she comes from a lot of privilege and we don't see eye to eye on a lot of things. An example of this is wanting to hotline for a student reporting they have bugs in their house, they live in a duplex that edges the woods, they are well taken care of and rodents are frequent around here we have them in our school. We had a long discussion about it. I dont think she felt supported but I didn't know how else to handle it. I have the sibling in my grade and have worked with this family a lot. A hotline call for something like this would be detrimental to our relationship and I don't feel that bugs are abuse or neglect if the student doesn't have bites or evidence of them (crawling out of their stuff, etc). I ended up telling her to go with her gut, hotline if she felt she should. \n\nAnother incident that rubbed me the wrong way was when she met with a students family she looked up their address in the system. She was telling me about the family, mom is white and dad is black, she made a comment about the affluent neighborhood that they live in and \"they must rent\". \n\nAgain, not super important but gives some background in why I'm feeling the way I am. I realize I commented about her being long winded and I'm writing a book! \n\nAt the beginning of the year our director visited us to talk out a plan for the year and go over our expectations and what not. At that time, I changed my scope and sequence begrudgingly because I knew being in a new school it's nice to feel like you have control over something. I had previously worked hard to get it where it needed to be with the previous cocounselor, based on our students needs. I also made some other changes like how we do lunch duty, which really messed up my schedule, to try and accommodate her. I held her hand for the first 2 months. I invited her to all my teacher meetings and anything she wanted to go to so she felt included and welcome in the building. Social gatherings i always made sure she knew about so she didn't feel left out. I really tried to build a positive vibe in the school, she was in district previously so I knew her but I wanted her to feel welcome in her new school. \n\nRecently she has offered to help with things. For the school store she sat in my office one day for half the day working on buckets to sell things from. I had ziploc bags and was upgrading to plain buckets. She opted to decorate them. While doing this, she complained that she was expected to do it and how it shouldn't fall on us. This was her choice to help and even do this. I was fine with plain buckets. \n\nHere's where it gets interesting. Recently she has been complaining a lot about our administration and how she doesn't feel like they like her. She has also made comments to me, as well as other teachers who are telling me, that \"no one appreciates me, I'm sorry i don't have time to make videos and do all that stuff\". Shots fired am I right? I get it. I am a chairperson for our pbis committe. I enjoy doing things that help cover tier 1 intervention in a fun way. If I can get our kids on board and excited I am down. In the end, it helps limit the number of kids that are coming to me for things they should be able to handle on their own. They are learning their tier 1 skills through pbis lessons and our weekly counseling lessons. I don't feel like this is way outside my scope of work or job description. Maybe it is. \n\nDuring meetings she often asks for me to support her in her thoughts. This part i was an AH and wasn't supportive. She asked \"i have never been used as an incentive in CICO before, have you?\" And because I have, I said yeah. I have. I see how that could have been worded differently and how I wasn't supportive. I apologized for that, in the meeting in front of the same people I said the comment in front of. She fired back \"well [students name] is always in your office so that doesn't count\". The student She listed was going through some issues at the beginning of the year and taking breaks frequently. They had a change in their IEP and have not seen me other than to walk by and say hi, since September. The student was also never on CICO so that wasn't even a relevant comment. \n\nShe has started taking more jabs at me, saying little comments, coming to complain about admin to me while also complaining that they treat her differently than me. She has been bringing up mistakes they made in the first weeks of school, such as calling me for a trauma response when it was her student, calling me first in situations where they need a counselor, a teacher reached out to me about help with an issue, etc. \n\nI got an email from my director saying she wanted to meet with me about my data and the non-school counseling duties I have. I thought this was funny since I hadn't entered much data for the year. Oops I was behind. My director met with me Friday and we talked for quite some time about how things are going. \n\nWhat it boils down to is I dont have my co counselors back and because I do other duties like pbis committee I am making her look bad. The co counselir also expressed that she doesn't want these responsibilities to fall on her shoulders. I get that, but if you don't want the responsibilities don't be the pbis committe chair person? No? I also am stuck with having the obligation of trying to figure out how to make myself less likeable? I don't know. I know I'm being hard headed right now. But the co counselir said she has teachers ask if she is OK because they said my name at an assembly and she never gets recognized. I feel that part isn't the truth but whatever. I made a video they announced I'd be showing it. \n\nI'm stuck on how to navigate this. I'm burdened with the task of stopping all the things I do outside of counseling. I'm also burdened with the task of being more supportive and getting admin to like my co counselor. I'm frustrated. My co counselor is sensitive and often feels attacked by things I wouldn't think twice about. She often comes to me about it and we talk through it but since I don't just immediately agree she feels I'm not being supportive. \n\nWhat do I do? How do I navigate this? Am I an AH for all of this? I am angry I don't want to go back to work and have to deal with this drama on top of my job. ",
