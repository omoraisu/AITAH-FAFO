      "selftext": "i met my best friend a couple years ago, and he is one of the greatest people i\u2019ve ever met, but unfortunately, i developed feelings for him along the way. we always had joked with each other in a sexual manner, and sometimes even emotionally. we had always jokes about our future kids, our marriage, and things of that nature. he is the only person who\u2019s ever treated me that way, and i think it was to do with the fact that im not considered that attractive. my best friend is very conventionally attractive on the other hand, which was what confused me about our relationship. he treated me like i meant something more to him. eventually, about three months ago, i confessed my feelings towards him. he told me that he basically felt the same way, but doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s smart to have something happen right now, considering that we go to different schools and he values our friendship more. i was content with this fact, and he suggested that we stop joking the way we do so it\u2019s easier to get over him. i was insistent we didn\u2019t, because i didn\u2019t want to lose the one thing we had. this was on me. i should\u2019ve respected his wishes to try and move on, because throughout those three months, i continued our friendship how it was before, but he seemed distant. i ignored this, thinking he was busy because he is a very busy person, whether that has to do with school or his sports. two nights ago, we had a conversation about our feelings again. i told him i hadn\u2019t moved on, and i don\u2019t think i ever will. i didn\u2019t realize this while i was talking, because i usually just pour my heart out to him, but he wasn\u2019t really agreeing like he typically did. but he tells me how important i am to him, and how much i mean to him. well, the next day i see he texted at 2 in the morning. he got a girlfriend not even an hour after our conversation. somebody that he had been talking to for about 3 months. i knew he knew her, but i didn\u2019t think he really liked her like that. i felt stupid, and i cried for hours. i blocked him everywhere immediately and he got frustrated at me for only looking for a relationship with him instead of the friendship we had. and that in throwing everything away. we had continuously talked about it until this morning, and i decided we should just go out separate ways. he admitted to having led me on, but blames me for giving myself false hope. idk what to do about this, i made it clear i want him to leave me alone but I also still want to talk to him about this.
