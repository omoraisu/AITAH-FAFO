      "selftext": "I am a 19 year old female student studying at a dental college. My previous aim was to study at a medical college for mbbs but I didn't want to take any more drops and i came to know about the scopes of dentistry. It has been 2 months since I left my home to study at the college since it is far away and I am staying at the college hostel( which is not good but they still got a lot of money for staying here from us) . Since it is the dental field, apart from the fees, they are asking me to buy a lot of dental materials( which they already got extra fees for btw) which has cost me about 5000 rupees till now.. and a lot of other health tests, vaccines and shit (which comes roughly upto 7000 rupees).. all was okay until I started reading my physiology textbook .. it was issued by the college and it is  really vague. I inquired about it with my seniors and they told me to try another book which cost about 2000 rupees and I don't know any seniors well enough  to buy a second hand book. I have a laptop and I downloaded the pdf of the book but it feels like it would be better if I had the hard copy of the boon to study. I called and told my mom about this and she and my father (who was in speaker btw) started yelling at me telling that I spend more than 2000 rupees every week. I kind of get where they are coming from( my mom has this big operation for cataract coming which will  be covered by the insurance but the tests cost a lot too and the fees they paid for my college was about 4.5 lakh which actually included the 40000 rupees for dental materials but the college is not providing it now.. they told us to wait for it for 2 more months) . I am from a upper middle class family and we are not really struggling for money per se.. but it is just the tone they took with me and i am really in a bad place right now mentally.. being in a new place and all the study pressure is getting to me and i have not seen my parents for nearly 2 months now since the college is really far from home . I don't really want to stay mad at my parents. But I don't know what to do..",

That said, it's okay to feel upset by their tone it\u2019s tough when you\u2019re already under so much pressure and just want support.\n\nMaybe you could try writing them a calm message explaining how their reaction made you feel, emphasizing that you\u2019re not trying to be careless with money but that these expenses are necessary for your studies.
