      "selftext": "My teenage son (18yo) just screamed and ranted at me with all manner of profanity because I asked him to check his attitude, turn off the PlayStation and join the family for a special Christmas activity.\n\nAll the cursing with F-this and F-that. C-word. Tw-word. Maximum volume. Rage. Suggested I engage in various vulgar acts.  All this while I was cooking him dinner. I finally just stopped and  said \u201cyou might be the biggest asshole I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d Now he thinks he\u2019s been victimized. Not my best moment, for sure, but mama had enough. \n\nBackground\u2014he has 2 present parents, a nice home, a car to drive, plays multiple sports, no substance use by any in the family, plenty of friends and opportunities, accepted to colleges.  I\u2019ve never missed any of his games, support him in school, host his friends regularly, feed his teammates,  provide plenty of hugs and praise. He  screams at me like this often, has spit on me, and punches walls when I have to set a boundary.  His dad does very little about it.  Note: neither of us uses the language he used tonight. \n\n Am I the jerk? Is it me? Am I the AH?",
