      "selftext": "Update: Definitely not fake\u2014Just my first Reddit post and didn\u2019t know how the operating system worked (hence the double post). My brothers and I were raised in a jacked up house with a religious nut job of a Mom. It was so ridiculous that we were not even allowed to go swimming at the pool. We were taught that ANYTHING sexual not related to procreation with your spouse was wrong. The funniest shit ever was when she would see a woman showing cleavage. \n\nMy wife and I are somewhat recently married, and we\u2019re a blended family with three teenage boys\u2014two hers and one mine. We\u2019ve created a sex-positive household where body confidence and self-expression are valued. My wife is very comfortable in her own skin and sometimes wears revealing clothing around the house\u2014like booty shorts or similar outfits. It\u2019s something we\u2019re both okay with and aligns with how we want to live in our home.\n\nRecently, my brother came over unannounced and made a comment about how \u201cinappropriate\u201d my wife\u2019s attire was. He said it made him uncomfortable and suggested that, with three teenage boys in the house, she should be more mindful of what she wears. I told him this is our home, not his, and that if he has a problem with what she wears, he doesn\u2019t need to come over. When he doubled down, I got frustrated and told him to \u201cscrew off.\u201d\n\nNow he\u2019s upset and accusing me of being disrespectful to him, saying I\u2019m prioritizing my wife\u2019s choices over \u201cbasic decency\u201d for guests and setting a bad example for the kids. Some family members have chimed in, saying I could\u2019ve handled it better or that maybe my brother has a point about how it could affect the boys.\n\nFrom my perspective, my wife isn\u2019t doing anything wrong. The boys are being raised to respect boundaries and understand body positivity. If my brother doesn\u2019t like it, I feel like that\u2019s his problem\u2014not ours.\n\nSo, AITAH for defending my wife and telling my brother to screw off instead of addressing his concerns more calmly?",
