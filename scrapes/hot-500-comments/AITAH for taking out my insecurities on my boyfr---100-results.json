      "selftext": "hello! before I get into this I want to clarify that my English and grammar may not be the best, English is not my first language but I will try my best to  make it make sense.\n\n I know the title is a bit confusing but let me explain. I 18f have been dating my boyfriend 18m for a year and a half. \n\nfor some background, before I met my boyfriend I was dating this guy named Matthew(fake name).  I grew really insecure from my relationship with him because of multiple things he would do such as looking at other girls, liking other girls posts in bikinis, talking about how fine other girls are and how they have nice butts. Matthew would also create fake accounts to stalk his ex and was obsessing over her our entire relationship without my knowledge. I found this all out after we broke up and that he had just been using me to make his ex jealous or maybe get her attention? he wanted to post me 1 week into us talking not even dating, which is what makes me suspicious. also another factor in our relationship that may seem irrelevant but is would be the way he treated me. although he was looking at other girls all the time and obsessing over his ex, he would go through my following and snapchat to make sure I wasn't following any boys and I wasn't allowed to be friends with other guys. he wouldn't let me tutor my guy friend and got mad at me and would threaten me by breaking up then self deletion and threatening to tell my parents we were dating (I wasn't allowed to date), and he would justify his behavior by saying that his ex had cheated on him.\n\nwith all that being said, I can see those behaviors in my past relationship rubbing off on me. I am really insecure, I hate when he looks at other girls in real life or even on TV or like really pretty celebrities that he obviously will never be with. people say they don't care if their partner looks at other people and finds them attractive but I personally can't handle it. I feel terrible and will act out towards him. I don't let him look at other girls (he respects this) but he says he doesn't anyways because he thinks finding celebrities attractive is stupid. He doesn\u2019t have social media and that makes me relieved because i know he isn\u2019t looking at his previous interests or looking at other girls. I also don\u2019t let him have any girl friends which is also a mutually respected decision as i don\u2019t have any guy friends either. We feel that each others presence is enough and we don\u2019t have to be friends with people if he opposite sex because it makes us uncomfortable. he told me this morning that after dating me for so long, he doesn't look at people and think they're attractive because that factor isn't even in the equation anymore for him. he tells me Im the only girl he will ever find attractive and I'm the most beautiful woman he has met but I am always doubting myself. he tells me these things but I always have creeping thoughts that he does find other girls attractive and that hurts me because I don't think I'm the prettiest person and I am not so confident in myself. I only started being this way, super insecure after Matthew. after dating my current boyfriend for a year and a half, I feel like I haven't improved one bit in this aspect of insecurity in my relationship or within myself. he also enables me because yes he supports me when I act like this towards him and raise concern about him looking at other woman (which he never does) but I hate this thing about myself but I don't know how to fix it because I don't know if therapy will help and I haven't been able to overcome my low self esteem.\n\nI'm sorry the post got so long but can someone let me know if I'm being TAH for acting like this? I feel like I just become more insecure everyday for no reason and have no self esteem although he tells me I'm beautiful at least 15x a day. he swears he doesn't mind and even likes this behavior from me but I feel like this might push him away in the long run because people love a person who's confident and I just assume my boyfriend wants me to be that way.",
