      "selftext": "I am a dance videographer and film dance competitions and concerts. i drive far depending on the location, 1 to 1.5 hours from where i\u2019m based. for the past week ive been really unwell and had 3 days off work, body aches and a gross flemmy cough. today (sunday) i am still very tired and living off my energy drink driving back home from my job to my bosses house to drop filming equipment off. i have a podcast on to keep me awake while driving on the freeway. \n\nwhile driving i notice my music stops and i see that christmas music is starting to play and my spotify is being used for the tv at home. for context - when my family sets up the christmas tree we listen to christmas music. confused, i change the spotify back to my podcast and keep driving. i do this about 3 more times before receiving a call from my brother. i answer and put it on speaker. my mum starts telling me they want to use my spotify to play christmas music. i say \u201cno, im using my spotify, use someone else\u2019s\u201d i say this pretty loud since i know they\u2019d find it hard to hear me while im driving. from then i couldn\u2019t understand anything on the phone. the connection must not of been great because i couldn\u2019t decipher a single word that was being said to me and had to constantly keep asking \u201cwhat was that ?\u201d or \u201ci cant hear you\u201d. i also couldn\u2019t hear who i was speaking to. so before i ended the call i said \u201cim using my spotify to drive home, use someone else\u2019s\u201d. \n\ni get to my bosses house, drop off filming equipment and drive back home. after getting home and inside i say hello to both my mum and brother and only get a hello from my brother. and so i say hi again directed at my mum and she says nothing. so i drop my own belongings into my room and come out to help with decorating the tree. i say hi again and my mum goes \u201cdon\u2019t you ever speak to me like that again\u201d and i looked at her confused. she continues and goes \u201cthat was me who you where speaking to on the phone, that just shows how selfish you are.\u201d i tell her i couldn\u2019t hear anything on the phone so i didnt know who i was talking to. she then goes \u201cdon\u2019t bother putting your spotify back on the tv i\u2019ve deleted it\u201d. i stand there for maybe 5 more seconds and then leave to my room. i end up bawling my eyes out because i can\u2019t understand where i went wrong and how i upset her. i didn\u2019t even know who i was talking to on the phone and i know she wouldn\u2019t believe if even if i said otherwise. \n\nto add, my mother and brother both have spotify accounts. that\u2019s why i said use someone else\u2019s, because i was very aware they both have one. it also doesn\u2019t take long to log in another account onto the tv. my brother could of easily helped her. should i have gone about it a different way when on the phone with her ? i was driving on the freeway at the time so i was focusing more on the road than the phone call. my tone of voice wasn\u2019t overly great, it was more annoyed because my spotify started changing while mid drive. but then the phone cut out and i hardly heard anyone. atiah ?\n",
