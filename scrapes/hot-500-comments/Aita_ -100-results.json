      "selftext": "Wondering if I\u2019m being overly dramatic that i refuse to let my ex take the Christmas tree we had together and use it for him and his new gf. Some back story we got this tree for our little family to set up with our son who is now 7 but my ex cheated on me and left me for this other girl in April (15 days after our son turned 7) and now wants me to let him have our family Christmas tree bc they can\u2019t afford one and don\u2019t want our son to not have a Christmas tree at their house since I went and got a new one bc I cried when I tried setting our family one up. He thinks I\u2019m being selfish and says it\u2019s just a tree and it\u2019s for our son anyways and not for them. I know it\u2019s just a tree but it to me it holds a lot of memories and I don\u2019t want my son to get the wrong idea if I just give it to them to put up in their house with all of the decorations we hand picked out over the years.(yes he wants all the decorations as well he\u2019s not negotiating on just the tree) ",

Like you said you picked those out as a family, they can\u2019t just have the whole set up that\u2019s crazy. They don\u2019t can hand make ornaments and string dollar popcorn on the tree lol.",
