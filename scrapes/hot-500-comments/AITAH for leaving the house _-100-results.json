      "selftext": "My mom and i have had a very difficult relationship but we've stayed strong together through the ton of bullshit we've been through (mostly because of shit partners she's been with) and since we last moved i decided i need to be more independent. \n\nKeep in mind i'm 16, homeschooled and working two jobs as a petsitter and a waiter. I do the cleaning in the house, it has always been my job and since we live in a rather small appartment it's not much of a bother, just vacuum the house every two days for the dog hair, mop right after, dishes every night and take out the trash from time to time.\n\nDespite this, my mother tends to throw tantrums when emotionally unstable (when tired, in love or drunk) where she starts yelling and crying saying i dont do anything for her and i dont care about her, saying i dont have empathy and sometimes resorting to throwing objects, glasses of water and such at walls or furniture.\n\nShe's a therapist and repeats to me that i have all the behavioral symptoms of asperger syndrome, diagnosis which was denied by a psychiatrist after i decided i wanted to be sure and made the appointment myself. \n\nWhile i am not perfect i will admit, (i tend to struggle with my (diagnosed) depression and cant keep a decent sleep schedule for the life of me and, because of this, tend to struggle with expressing and controling my emotions and needs) i've been trying to do my best to keep us afloat through the past couple of years.\n\nYesterday, i wasnt home, went driving to pick up a dog i was gonna be keeping, she threw another one of those tantrums, i got home to broken glass all over the floor, her car missing, and an emptied bottle of wine on the table. \n\nNow usually, when these tantrums take place, i lock the dogs in my room so they dont get hurt because of the glass, this time though, i found my own dog, Hubble, with his paws bleeding. I of course immediatly took him to the vet, where i stayed for a couple hours, went back home and cleaned the mess. \n\nShe usually comes back fairly fast after leaving for this kind of emotional outburst, but she wasnt coming back and wasnt answering her phone, i went to pack everything i'd need in the future, computer, all my schoolwork, some clothes and some books, statched my guitar, simracing rig and other expensive equipment i paid myself in my garage (i rent myself for a motorcycle i bought myself as well) decided to take the dogs at a friends house. \n\nI left a note to my mom saying i was closing her access to my bank account and that despite all i loved her, she had gone too far and needed to be helped, i told her i was leaving for a while and that i'll be getting my own appartment. I've been staying at my friends house since, and i'm looking into renting an appartment nearby...\n\nDid i overreact ? Should i go back on my decision and come back to take care of her ? Should i try to get her professional help ? What do i do ? I'm honestly quite lost",
