      "selftext": "My (28F) husband (24M) started taking my charger adapter recently, for the past couple days. He unplugs my cord and plugs in his. Today, he got annoyed that the adapter wasn\u2019t where he left it, and asked where I put it. I told him I left it in the living room, but that it\u2019s actually mine and asked him where the other one is.\n\nHe says that I\u2019ve actually been taking his, and I was the one that lost mine. And that I always lose things, so I must\u2019ve lost it. I told him again, that it was actually the other way around and he\u2019s been taking mine. I didn\u2019t want to go to sleep and wake up with a low charge or dead phone on the morning of an interview, so I told him he probably left his somewhere \u201cdumb\u201d (as in a random place) in the office room. \n\nI went up to go check, but couldn\u2019t find it. I came back, and asked him where his work bag was. He didn\u2019t respond at first, and I said Hello? Where did you leave your work bag, I couldn\u2019t find it in the other room. He then tells me it\u2019s in the living room on the couch. \n\nI go and look inside his work bag, and surprise there is a cord with the other adapter in the pocket of the bag. \n\nI go back in the bedroom and said \u201cGuess what I found?\u201d And dropped the charger in the middle of the bed. He said he didn\u2019t recognize that charger and it wasn\u2019t his. I told him I found it in the work bag. I go to plug my cord in and plug my phone in to charge, and asked him if he admits I didn\u2019t take his. He said he didn\u2019t again, I guess he was actually annoyed but I thought he just was being a little sheepish atm and didn\u2019t want to admit it outloud. He starts \u201cyelling\u201d (not really yelling, just talking in a slightly louder tone more upset tone) \u201cAnd who is the one that always loses things??\u201d I then just started to realize he was kinda upset, but I said, \u201cBut I proved I didn\u2019t lose it this time though because it was sitting in your work bag?\u201d\n\nHe got really annoyed and said \u201cYou\u2019re being super annoying. I\u2019m going to punch your face if you ask me that again.\u201d\n\nI then told him he was just being pissy because he knows he was wrong and is mad that I proved him wrong. To which he said, \u201cwhatever you wanna believe.\u201d\n\nI feel like what he said was totally out of proportion, since I was just joking around, and because it\u2019s over something stupid. \n\nI admit I was being really petty, in pushing to get him to admit outloud to me that he did in fact take my adapter and I haven\u2019t been taking his, but was I the asshole here?\n\nEdit: He would never actually hurt me. We rarely ever argue, this really is just a one off occurrence. Also, we\u2019ve never really had problems with losing our chargers before so I never had to initial it prior to now. \n\nExtra context: I\u2019ve been taking a new medication that\u2019s been giving me severe insomnia/sleep deprivation and by proxy him as well (from my restless tossing and turning at night)",
