      "selftext": "I made friends with a guy a year and a half ago, mainly because I knew we liked similar things (we both played an instrument, liked tarot and metal). After two weeks of being friends, he told me he was in love with me. I explained to him as nicely as I could that, after two weeks of knowing each other, he couldn't possibly be in love with me, and that, on top of this, I had been SA'd by my then boyfriend a few months prior, on top of psychological abuse, so dating or catching feelings wasn't in my to do list at all. After that, our relationship took a u turn. He tried to use me as his therapist, tried to guilt trip me, telling me that I broke his heart so hard that he tried to commit suicide, he told me that I was so traumatized that he involuntarily \"stole\" a part of my trauma and was traumatized. He also kept telling me about the psychiatrist and the therapist that he was seeing, saying that it wasn't enough to handle his sorrow, when he knew that I wasn't receiving any help about the trauma of the rape I survived not long ago, and that I had tried to end my life as well. It became too hard, and my best friend encouraged me to block him everywhere. That's what I did, but then he stalked me for three months and wrote me a 13 pages long letter about his feelings and how I broke his heart. I was finally able to get rid of him irl, and then we both changed cities, so I was finally free from his words. Now I understand that everybody copes differently, and that we all have our own sensitivity, but I couldn't handle him rubbing in my face all the help he was getting for a heartbreak while I was struggling to even be allowed to change my classes so that I wouldn't have to stay in the same room as my rapist the whole day. \nThe madness stopped 7 months ago, and now I've been living my life a bit more normally. \nThe real issue happened tonight. this morning, I woke up, and noticed some texts from him on insta. He had called me twice, and was begging me to reply, even if I just said a random word, telling me how unwell he was feeling. I know from a mutual friend that he has become an alcoholic since he changed cities, and I was afraid that he might have done something stupid or killed himself during the night. When I saw the texts, I immediately panicked, tried to call him and text him, but no reply. Our mutual friend also did, as I told her I was worried, but he didn't reply to her either. \nAfter 10 long hours of panicking and thinking that someone died because of me, he texted back, as though nothing had happened. He asked me how I was doing, if I liked my new college, told me that he was having fun in his, and that he was drinking a lot (he really insisted a lot on the fact that he drinks almost everyday), and I'm absolutely mad. This man just made me think that I was the worth person on earth, and that, just because I had rejected someone and that I was sleeping, someone had killed themselves, and now he was acting like it was all good? \nI really want to block him, and my best friend encouraged me to do so, but I'm afraid that it might make things worse. What if he gets drunk again? What if he kills himself for good? What if he puts the blame on me, and a cop investigation has to be done on me because of his words? Would I truly be the one to blame?
