      "selftext": "Exactly as the title says. My younger sister (15F) has been an absolute pain recently and it has me debating whether or not I should even give her the present I got her or just keep it for myself. The problem mostly is that me and her alternate walking the dog so I walk him in days I\u2019m not working and she does when I do, but whenever I come home and check if he\u2019s been walked or not it\u2019s always a no and there will be pee around the house. She always has some sort of excuse like I was playing volleyball all day and I\u2019m tired, or it\u2019s raining so on and so forth. Even if I try and get my parents help they don\u2019t do anything and more or less ignore me and actually get mad at me for coming to them about this. Not only that but we have this thing in my family that whoever doesn\u2019t have a job has to mow the back and front lawn when it gets long. Pretty fair right? Well she was supposed to mow it in September ~ October  ish and still hasn\u2019t. I try and tell her to whenever the weather isn\u2019t bad but again she just ignores it and my parents don\u2019t do anything. The thing is, is that my parents are the ones who complained about having to hire professionals to mow our lawn cause it got too long last time. So I feel pretty justified in not giving her present or AITA?",
