      "selftext": "My best mate and I bought a house together in 2019. Both of us male and 20 at the time. I put in 20k to the deposit and him 5k. I cared about him at the time and still do so I wanted to give him a good deal. As a result I said when it comes to selling the house we would take our deposits and split all further proceeds 50:50. \n\nWhen I arranged this I wasn't expecting the UK housing market to go quite as mad as it did but anyway, 5 years have passed and the house has appreciated about 50k-60k in value. 40% increase in 5 years. \n\nI should point out that at the time I was living with my parents and being bullied by my older brother, so I was really desperate to leave.\nAbout a year after we bought the place my mate asked his girlfriend (same age) to move in with him. I'm sure you can guess where this is going. I think I may have to stick this on r/AITAH as well.\n\nShe had moved in while finishing her degree during COVID and then went into a training year as a teacher. During this she wasn't being paid. (Except for the student loans and grants) \n\nDuring this time I said she could live there free of charge as long as she tidied after herself given she wasn't earning. \n\nWhen she did start to earn I requested that she pay 20% of the living cost while me and Alex would split the remaining costs. This means she started paying \u00a3250 per month only after 18months of living in the house for nothing. This has increased to \u00a3350p/m giving increased cost of living in the last 5 years. This is to cover all her portion of all living costs so includes not just the house, energy bills and utilities, but also, all the groceries.\n\nAs time went on they gradually (both my mate and his girlfriend) stopped tidying up after themselves. I don't like mess, it stresses me out. Aside from basic stuff like cleaning the dishes they use, his girlfriend is also  into cosplay so often takes up the living room while making her new costumes or props and doesn't tidy up after herself. This renders the whole room unusable because there isn't enough floor the step across let alone that she leaves glass tipped sewing pins scattered about the place which I can't see in the carpet because I'm short sighted. \n\nOver the past five years, I have been desperately asking them both more and more frequently to tidy up after their mess and leave shared spaces as they find them. I hate confrontation following my relationship with my brother so just asking feels hard to do. My friend is unhappy about it but generally gets on with it when asked. His girlfriend however becomes defensive and says she too busy and doesn't have the energy for it. Tells me I'm disrespectful for asking her to tidy up after herself. Tells me it doesn't make her feel welcome.\n\nFinally, the last piece of context for you. I don't like Christmas. Not specifically Christmas itself, there is a lot to enjoy on the day. It's the prolonged lead up accompanied by the worst music available. When I was young my dad was an alcoholic and as mentioned I was bullied by brother as well. On top of this we were poor so all my presents were shared gifts. Much love to my parents, my dad no longer drinks and is doing very well but, I've got plenty of trauma in the Christmas period and Christmas decorations and music are triggering for me so I ask that we don't put any up in our house until mid December. \n\nMy mates girlfriend loves Christmas and every single year has gone behind my back and bought a tree in the first week of December. My mate has put her wants before mine every year so far. This year in February of 2024 I started being very unwell. Turns out picking up all the pressure of keeping a house of three occupants tidy, working a full time job, and trying to study for master will give you stress induced IBS so now when I'm stressed I vomit and struggle with my bowels.\n\nSo this year they once again went out and bought a tree behind my back. When they returned with it, I told them how upset I was that they were going behind my back, and how they don't seem to care about my needs at all. I told them, they're not putting the tree up until they've finished clearing up after themselves. I won't let them add stress to my life until they've subtracted the stress they've caused by never tidying up afterthem selves. \n\nAgain, my mates girlfriend got angry with me and said that I can't tell them what to do and that I'm not their parents. I told them that may be true but regardless, legally, I have no responsibility to let her live in my house at all and that I'm giving her a  remarkably good deal and that if she wants to keep living in my house then that's part of the deal because I can't have the house a mess as well as being reminded of some of my worst memories because it will make me sick. \n\nThe conversation eventually became heated and the stress of the conversation alone has made me unwell all day but, my mate did the following day begin to clear up and nothing more was said. His girlfriend just left the house.\n\n I go to my parents for a meal because my mom knows I'm stressed out and wants to make sure I'm eating properly (my brother now lives in London which is hours away so that's not a problem anymore). When I return home from dinner the tree is up in the living which has been cleared up but the kitchen is still in the same disgusting state. \n\nI just saw it, picked it up decorations and all, and put it back into the garage reminding them what I'd said the previous day that they can have it up once they were done. Of course this has upset them both my mate especially because he actually did put some effort in during the day. Ive ended up leaving and going back to my parents so I can try to calm down and not feel so sick. \n\nI feel like I'm not asking the world here and I've let them get their way for 5 of the 6 Decembers already but this one is different for me because of the IBS. They're making me feel like the worst person alive and again saying I have no respect for them. Ill be the first to admit that I'm socially awkward, thanks I think to the bullying but, I think my actions speak loudest. I've given my mate a favourble deal for equity (which gives him about 11k more than he'd have under the standard arrangement and his girlfriend only had to pay 350 a month for all her living costs. Where else can you get a deal like that no money down?\n\nMy plan tomorrow is to begin the procedures to put the house on the market so we can go separate ways. I also want to see if I can have his girlfriend moved out before then as she gives me nothing but grief. I'm devastated because I think I've lost my best mate over this. I don't regret giving him the deal. I still want the best for him, I just wish they could recognise how nice I was trying to be because now I really fell like the bad guy but Im not sure I should. \n\nTLDR: don't buy a house with a mate unless you're really desperate like I was. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

But they're clearly hypocritical. To them, you can't get mad when they can't do the basic task of cleaning, but they can get mad when you ask them to not bring additional clutter into the home after still not cleaning. I bet they'd make you clean that as well.",
