      "selftext": "So im 25 my SO and i have recently gone through a rough patch. To keep it shirt for anyone reading my SO of 2 years almost 3 now. Became friends with my friends specifically one friend that they considered closest to, chose me and sympathized with me because they were being unreasonable. My friends saw this on a trip we went together and my SO got hurt and asked me to leave the friend group all together pretty much an ultimatum AITAH? Ive been going back and forth and honestly my health taken a turn for the worse (unrelated but also related cause its caused by stress) so ive moved out and it felt wrong to see my friends so for a few months now ive been stuck on bed rest and pretty much alone so im trying to get a perspective. \n\n",

My ideal group of people and friends.\n\nI really tried to not be friends with people and be alone but honestly ive never been so dysfunctional in my life.
