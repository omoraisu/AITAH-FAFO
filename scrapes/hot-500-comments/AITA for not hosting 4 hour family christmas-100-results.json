      "selftext": "I am a 62 year old mother with 3 adult children-son & DIL (35 & 41) who have 2 children(ages 5 & 3), son (single) age 32, and daughter & SIL (30 & 29) who have a 1 year old. None of them live with me and my daughter lives about 2.5 hours away. All of us work FT with busy schedules. They always spend christmas eve and christmas day with thier inlaws. They collectively have offered to come to my home anticipating a meal and gift exchange in a 4 hour period of time and then they all leave for another event. I feel like this is a pit stop 4 them long enough 2 eat and grab thier christmas gifts but not have to visit or play.  I want more time and feel like if they are sooo busy the most they can spend with me is 4 hours then I am ok just not having a family christmas gathering this year.  AITA ",
