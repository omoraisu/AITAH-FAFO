      "selftext": "I (19f) have a brother (9m) who had very different childhood then me. I have an older brother who is disabled and was incredibly violent so my parents often had to manage him, usually leaving me with my two younger brothers with the youngest being newborn. I had zero friends because I always had to be home to help, I had no hobbies, and I struggled with depression and SI and even self harm as I got older and I was all alone. Fast forward to now and I\u2019m married and pregnant with my first child and I\u2019m stoked but it\u2019s been hard cause I just moved from California and I\u2019m staying with my parents while we look for apartments and save up. My little brother is grown up and he doesn\u2019t know how to do anything, he can\u2019t make age appropriate snacks on his own, keep up proper hygiene without reminders, my parents do everything for him and all he does is go to school, play hockey, and play Fortnite. No chores, no nothing. He screams and throws tantrums and my parents just ignore it and move on. It drives me insane cause even though I am super happy that my brother doesn\u2019t have my childhood, this is bad too! I just don\u2019t understand why my parents work in extremes and it\u2019s so hard to watch. My dad had parents who weren\u2019t around so he was basically raised by his sisters and my mum had to raise her siblings, so in their mind, I should be a 3rd mother to my brother. I play with him sometimes but I\u2019m an adult and both my parents work from home so I don\u2019t really see why I need to play mother even when I\u2019m pregnant. My dad left me home with my brother and said \u201cI made hard boiled eggs for him so when they are done peel them for him\u201d and that triggered me for some reason. I asked \u201che can\u2019t peel his own eggs???\u201d Which my dad said \u201cwell he\u2019s playing video games and you are his sister\u201d like, no! He can peel his own eggs! I gave up my childhood damnit this kid can peel in own damn eggs!!! Stuff like this happens a lot and just seeing him screams at my parents all the time and sit around and play video games all day without a thought in the world just kills me and it makes me wish my parents could just treat us somewhere in the middle where we are safe and comfortable but also taught age appropriate things. I feel bad cause I know it\u2019s not his fault he\u2019s a bully but it hurts so bad and I can\u2019t explain why. AITA?",

You say that your father was raised by his sisters, while your mother was a caretaker for her younger siblings. This likely gave both of them a powerful presupposition that \"The girl is always responsible.\" This is aggravated by your older brother's situation and the fact that you were the only girl in your family. I think it's very telling that your father's response to the eggs was \"you are his sister.\" It sounds like he has an unexamined assumption from his own upbringing that boys are raised in helpless dependence and \"sister\" really means \"mother.\" \n\nIt might be helpful to have a private conversation with your parents in which you point out to them how their own childhood experiences warped their point of view of what it means to be a sister, and how out of step this is with modern expectations for both boys and girls. Point out that your brother is not going to be equipped to deal with the world if they don't make some changes. I don't know, they might not receive that well, but then again it might make them take another look at their subconscious attitudes. \n\nApart from that, all you can do is set boundaries, and move out as soon as you can.",
