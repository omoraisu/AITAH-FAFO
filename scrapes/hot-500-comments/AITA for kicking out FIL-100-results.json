      "selftext": "My FIL (~70) and I were never particularly close. When I met my husband in our late Teens, they had'nt spoken for years - FIL was a drunk and a loser who left MIL after their unplanned 3rd son was born and fled the country to avoid legal beef with tax authorities. Never paid child support and for years all the kids ever got from him was Yahoo e-cards on the high holidays. Now since a few years back, the two eldest sons (including my husband) have sporadic contact. All three boys are however pretty close with their grandma who recently turned 91. She's a sassy and funny but sweet old Lady and I like her a lot. Now, grandma wanted to come Visit for a weekend but due to her age and the long distance train ride she asked FIL to accompany her. They've done this before a few years ago and it was OK - FIL basically spent all his time in his room playing some facebook farm game and granny got to spend quality time with the great-grandkids. So I thought it would be the same deal this time around but boy was I wrong. First, he criticized me for making my son gay because I let him wear a Christmas dress. Then, the conspiracy theories started. At lunchtime, he started complaining about the [slur for black people] and the final straw was when I went for a quick shower and he started watching war videos about the islamists in Syria with our kindergartener. When I came out of the bathroom and saw this, I asked him to stop the video because it's not appropriate for kids and he basically exploded and screamed at me that I'm trash and he could never stand me. So I told him to GTF out of my apartment. Husband is generally on my side but thinks I should have \"handled it more professionally\" because \"he's too old to reason with\" and grandma left with FIL and seemed very hurt. Which I understand and I'm really sorry to spoil her weekend visit but I just didn't find it in me to be the bigger person and let it go. Now, AITA? And any ideas on how to make up for this with granny?\n\nTLDR: Kicked my nasty FIL out for showing my kindergartener war videos and generally being a prick. Ruined grandma in laws visit as collateral damage.",
