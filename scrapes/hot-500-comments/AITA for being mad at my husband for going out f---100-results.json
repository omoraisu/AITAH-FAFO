      "selftext": "My husband and I both work shift jobs. He also door dashes on the side for extra money, as he\u2019s been complaining about being extra broke lately. We had a similar shift one day, meaning our dog would be alone a long time. I told him that if he needed to DoorDash after work, that I would leave work a little bit early and rush home in order to walk the dog.  Towards the end of my shift, he text messages me to let me know that he got a holiday bonus from his boss, so isn\u2019t going dashing. When I read this message, I decide that I no longer have to leave work early and race home for the dog. About 30 minutes later, he tells me that he is instead of going DoorDash and going to go out for drinks with his coworkers. So now the dog was left alone for an extra hour. \n\nHis argument is that had he done DoorDash he wouldn\u2019t have been home anyway, but my argument is that being out working and making money is a way different reason to not be home then getting wasted with your friends, especially when your dog is home, waiting to be walked. He is claiming he did nothing wrong, and accusing me of attempting to ruin his night because I\u2019m jealous I wasn\u2019t out with his friends. When all that I\u2019m upset about is the fact that it seems he doesn\u2019t care enough about taking care of our pets. So\u2026AITA for being upset?",
