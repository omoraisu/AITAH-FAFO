      "selftext": "EDIT: meant to put slap, not hit in the title and reddit won\u2019t let me edit that part for some reason.\n\nMy husband (25M) has always had this habit of poking, grabbing, slapping, or hitting my butt or private area. (Never too hard or painfully though). I usually do not mind it nor care because I know that\u2019s how he displays his affection sometimes. However 6 days ago, I gave birth to our first child. Long story short, I had a 2nd degree tear and needed stitches and I\u2019m not going to lie, it\u2019s incredibly painful as is. Sitting down, peeing, wiping etc feels like burning torture and I\u2019m still very sore. After 4 long nights of barely any sleep and finally getting our daughter to sleep and stop crying at a normal hour, I was totally exhausted and planned to go to sleep myself. My husband offered to have sex, I told him we can\u2019t have sex until 6 weeks. He thought it was 6 DAYS after birth that you can have sex so he got really annoyed and kept trying to tell me it\u2019s \u201cunnecessary\u201d and I don\u2019t need to wait that long. I kept telling him no over and over and once he finally let it go, he kissed me and then he did his signature vagina grab-and-slap that he does every time. I absolutely jumped and screamed and almost fell to my knees from the burning pain after. He asked what was wrong with me and I told him he can\u2019t do that anymore because I have literal stitches there. \n\nI never realized how naive and sheltered my husband was when it comes to knowing anything about childbirth because he literally had the nerve to say \u201cyou\u2019re lying, why would you have stitches there\u201d. I then had to explain to him, while I\u2019m sitting there is agonizing, soring pain that my vagina literally tore apart from our daughter\u2019s head trying to come out. He literally standed there, seeing me crouched on my knees, holding my cooch, sobbing in pain and instead of deciding to help me or AT LEAST apologize, went on to say \u201cWhat do you mean it tore apart? How is that possible? It\u2019s literally made for babies to come out of\u201d. I screamed at him and called him an idiot and told him to go away. He left without helping me up or checking on me and was just mad that I called him an idiot and screamed at him.\n\nIt has now been 4 hours and I iced myself down there, laid down for a little and I feel slightly better now. However he\u2019s ignoring me, giving me dirty looks and told me I am being overdramatic and that \u201cthe whole world has had babies, why is it his fault my p***y doesn\u2019t work right\u201d. I told him almost every first time mom tears during child birth and he\u2019s not having it. He thinks I\u2019m just lying and being dramatic and selfish so I can take out my stress on him and have an excuse to not have to have sex with him (Like\u2026.what?). He can\u2019t comprehend that he caused me awful pain and didn\u2019t even bother to at least say \u201csorry I hurt you\u201d. He then asked ME to apologize for screaming at him and calling him an idiot which I refused to do.\n\n\nI need to know if I\u2019m actually being overdramatic and should apologize. I didn\u2019t mean to hurt his feelings and call him an idiot, but It hurt REALLY, REALLY bad. But AITA?",
