      "selftext": "Not me, but my spouse. This happened a few years ago and it's bothered me ever since. \n\nEarly in our relationship, my spouse (at the time, 25 MtF pre-transition) brought me (at the time, 25NB) to a family gathering for their birthday. Spouse and I are both on the spectrum ourselves (we were each diagnosed with Aspergers as kids, back when that was still a diagnostic category). While there, spouse mentioned that they'd always wondered whether their neice (5 at the time) was also on the spectrum. They asked for my opinion, because I had an undergraduate background in child psychology. I answered that I'm not qualified to diagnose anyone, and that even if I was, I've met the kid twice, so I hadn't even seen much of her behavior. This conversation continued, and eventually they asked if they should ask their sister (33 at the time) whether she'd considered having neice \"tested\" for it. \n\nI said I didn't know the sister, and I also don't know much about their relationship, so I'm not sure. I said that if they did have the kind of relationship where they discussed that kind of thing, and where she'd view the question as coming from a good place, then it couldn't hurt to mention sometime. \n\nSpouse immediately went into the room where the sister was. They were the only two in the room, so it was a private conversation. I don't know the exact phrasing that was used, but spouse said something along the lines of the title. \n\nThe next thing I saw was sister chasing spouse into the room where the rest of the family was, while attempting to hit spouse and getting a few slaps in. She yelled to the room that spouse had said neice was autistic, and my FIL took neice to the back porch while BIL started yelling at spouse. \n\nGrandma-in-law (?) Came to talk to me, saying negative things about my spouse and that she hated that \"vile\" thing spouse suggested about neice. Since she knew we were both also on the spectrum, describing being autistic as \"vile\" bothered me, but I didn't say anything about this in the moment. \n\nWe left the gathering, and spouse has refused to talk to sister or grandma since, and that decision has been broadly respected. \n\nI definitely recognize that her responding with violence was disproportionate, but I can't help but feel like there's some kind of social rule we fucked up on in the situation because my spouse asked the question and I didn't discourage it. \n\nSoooo... AITA? ",
