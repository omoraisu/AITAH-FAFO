      "selftext": "I (37f) have been with my wife (33f \u201cAlma\u201d) for a decade. She has raised my daughter with me, had always been kind and warm with my family, as had handled their many slights over the years with incredible self-control and grace. My family (mom, 4 older siblings and their spouses, 2 adult niece/nephews and their spouses) are homophobic, self righteous \u201clove the sinner, not the sin\u201d types. They refused to accept that I am a lesbian and still say I\u2019m going through a phase. They refuse to acknowledge my marriage and, over the years, did everything they could to alienate and isolate my wife and me. Examples: banding together against my wife (then long term live-in girlfriend) coming to family vacations, attacking me anytime I \u201cfell out of line\u201d by doing something like holding my wife\u2019s hand around them/their kids, called her \u201cbabe\u201d or introduced her to other people as my wife, telling me I\u2019m an abomination, telling my daughter (7 y/o at the time) that marriage is between a man and a woman only and that two girls or two boys do NOT belong together because god says it\u2019s wrong, giving us the silent treatment at family gatherings to make us feel unwelcome. Several years ago, I drew a line in the sand and demanded they either treat us with dignity and respect, or they wouldn\u2019t be a part of our lives. Needless to say, I ended up going no contact. It\u2019s been hard, especially for our daughter who misses her cousins, but it\u2019s been better for us spiritually, mentally, and physically.  This was incredibly hard though because I lost access to several nieces and nephews who I had been very close with, a daily person in their lives, and I adore them. They stopped being allowed to be around us because of our \u201cgay influence\u201d and them not wanting to think my wife and my \u201clifestyle is normal.\u201d I still send gifts to my nieces and nephews for Christmas. It bothers me immensely that for years, I\u2019ve signed the cards \u201cfrom Aunt *Me* and \u201cAlma\u201d (my wife). It pisses me off that my daughter refers to my siblings spouses as \u201cuncle\u201d \u201caunt\u201d as a matter of respect, based on their marriage. In fact, partners of people in the family (unmarried) have been referred to as \u201cAunt\u201d and \u201cUncle.\u201d My siblings told their kids in the past that Alma is not their aunt because that would through  marriage and 2 women can\u2019t be truly married in God\u2019s eyes. I\u2019m thinking of signing the card this year from \u201cAunt *ME* and Aunt Alma to affirm my wife\u2019s role as my spouse and push back for my own dignity, considering she is my legal wife. This could make me an AH because I know my siblings will be seething when they see it, feeling like I\u2019m trying to influence their kids or something; it could ruin an otherwise good day for them. My wife thinks it\u2019s pointless and will only cause more division. So please help me know if I WBTAH for doing this? ",

You're probably so much more than Aunt You and Aunt Alma to them - **you're their inspiration, their light at the end of a dark tunnel.**\n\nI was raised in a fundamentalist religion and I think I was always looking around for my *real* people biding my time until I could escape. I had some limited ties to extended family who I thought would help me (they didn't in the end, but things worked out okay for me).\n\nThe point is I was at least able to see or know of some of them as a child and that gave me a point of reference outside of the nuttiness of that religion. Right now you're doing the right thing by sending gifts and cards so the kids at least know you exist and care.\n\nI know it's hard for you to be no contact - I lost much contact as a result of the religion in addition to abuse - but you'd be the AH to yourself and Alma if you didn't protect yourself in that way. And if the kids ever want to escape that family to be their authentic selves, they know you exist.\n\nBecause of my experiences I'm now very sensitive to being that safe place for kids. My S/Os family isn't as extreme as mine (and our relationship is heterosexual) but they are conservative. They're very kind to the kids but I've told my S/O we must be that safe place if any get older and realize they're gay/trans/etc.\n\nWe recently went to visit and a big part of me going was getting to know the kids better. While there I got to chat with one of his older aunts who is a lesbian. I'm somewhat reserved (but sensed she'd experienced similar things in their family) so I've always made a point to be very kind/outgoing so she knew I liked her.\n\nI feel bad that her wife is never there and she kind of sits on the outskirts not quite included. None of them really ask about her wife and when she mentions her or talks about their life it's like everyone's eyes glaze over. It isn't right and I've always made a point to ask her how her wife is and what they've been up to.\n\nThis last trip I think I'd left enough bread crumbs for her to see she could talk to me about her life. She confided how the family had been to her. I told her I was very sorry and that never should've happened. The moment happened very quickly because I think she's always afraid someone will overhear.\n\nBut when I left I gave her a big hug and invited her to come visit us. I told her if my S/O and I were ever in her neck of the woods we'd both love to meet her wife if her wife wants to meet us. I'm hoping she now knows there are younger people in the family who won't be like the older family members were.\n\nWalking away from that I was like wow, I thought I needed to have a presence here for the younger people, but an older person was actually the one who needed that healing today. I have no doubt that'll happen for you one day - some of their kids are going to see the truth and grow up to be empathetic individuals.\n\nAs for my family, it's really tough. I don't have access or a good way to keep the door open to the kids. I've never met them. It's really hard to know they'll possibly experience similar abuse to me - emotional, physical, sexual and spiritual. I just have to hope they know I exist in case they ever want to leave.",
