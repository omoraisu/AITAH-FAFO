We texted for a little while and I lost my v-card to her, (unrelated), and I really regret that now because my first time should've been with someone I loved. So we were texting and she kept leaving me on open, I asked, \"is this funny to you,\" and she says, \"yes.\" Well fast forward a bit and she's leaving me on open over and over again, so I said, \"look I really need a friend right now.\" She then left me on open. So I said, \"we're not fucking friends anymore,\" she said, \"k.\" I was on vacation when this all went down and now that I'm home she dislikes me quite a bit. Am I the asshole?",

Because it seems like you kind of do but you say it's unrelated.\n\nShe said it's funny to her leaving you on seen, and I assume you needed someone to talk to or so, a friend for \"x\" reasons, if she can't be there for you yall aren't friends,  If it keeps getting annoying and she is leaving you on seen and you resent her because the v-card thing then it might be best to end things. She didn't seem to care when you broke off the friendship, so leave it to be and ignore her too.\n\nEdit: Btw, next time put AITA and then paraphrased the problem in the title, so people get a context before clicking the post",
