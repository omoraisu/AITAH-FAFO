      "selftext": "\n\nso ill set the scene, i, (16M) and my two other friends (16F) and (17F) have hardly been talking due to me meeting new, and honestly nicer people.\n\nfor simplicity, ill be calling (16F) Z and (17F) A.  we have been friends for 7 years before all of this.\n\ni felt like an asshole because those new people were the ones A had introduced me to, i ended up clicking with them faster than A did, and to this day we are close friends. but i know how it feels to introduce two friends to once another and slowly watch them get distant from you. so i did everything in my power to try and get them to connect.\n\nlater i realized i cannot force a connection between A and those people, obviously. i do realize this was overcompensation on my end, so instead i focused on starting conversations with her personally, using topics i knew they enjoyed so we could keep talking, but it was hard to get them to reciprocate or reply at all. \n\nafter a while of this cycle, i confront A for the first time, asking if anything was wrong because they werent nearly as reciprocative as she used to be. they tell me its just because shes exhausted from school and needs some time to herself, so i respect that and give her space.\n\nuntil i notice shes talking to Z alot more than shes talking to me, i disregard it at first because i assume theyre talking more since theyre in the same classes and have work to do together. \n\nthen later i also notice theyre playing games i had been telling them i wanted us to play together, but they kept shutting me down because they werent available. so i try confronting her about this again\n\nshe told me the same thing, that she was busy with school and work apparently. this is where i feel like something is up because she never even told me she had a job in the first place, i'd assume despite being busy you'd still think to update your so called best friend of 7 years about your first job right? obviously i dont make this my main point of focus when confronting her since it wasn't the main issue, it was just what helped me realize the way she was acting wasnt as normal as she made it seem.\n\ni tried asking Z if she knew what was going on, she said the same thing almost word for word, so i knew talking to her wouldnt have been very helpful.\n\ni eventually went to those other friends about it for a third party opinion, i didn't want to tell my family considering everyone was close and i didnt want to raise any tension between them if it turned out nothing was wrong, so i wanted to talk to somebody who had little to no involvement in our circle for this.\n\nthey eventually tell me its worth a shot to try and talk to them again, in a less sugarcoated way so i can really get my message across. and if they still wont make an effort, its better to drop them. those friends end up unfriending A on all socials, this detail will be important later.\n\ni insist a little more on getting information out of her, shes always had history of being avoidant when confronted but it was never this bad until i met my current friends. as expected nothing really came out of it until a couple days later. \n\nshe \"apologizes\" to me in a paragraph where she brought up several topics. the apology was something along the lines of \"sorry i've been distant, i'll play games with you another day\" \n\nand immediately it made me feel childish, because why was i upset over the fact she played games without me right?\n\nbut the fact that later in the paragraph she tried guilt tripping me by bringing up her fight she had with her brother made me doubt how seriously she was taking how i felt about this.\n\nin response i wrote back another paragraph, more blunt than the last one fully explaining what i had noticed from her from the very beginning, everything i mentioned in there i've already tried communicating the past but they were brushed under the rug by her, so this time i was more blunt about wanting her to listen to me for once.\n\nto try and summarize it, i explained that i didnt care about the games we played and how much we talked, i just wanted to make sure there wasnt any animosity between us because thats what it was starting to look like and i wasn't sure what i had done wrong but whatever it was i just wanted to know so i could fix it asap.\n\nshe snaps back at me and tells me that if she was actually being distant she wouldn't have come to Z's birthday party knowing i was there and that she was glad i understood we could keep our bond without talking all the time. \n\nthen she says . word for word, \"you didnt have to tell those two people, but you do you buddy \ud83e\udd37\u200d\u2642\ufe0f\"\n\nso this indicates shes upset, and im just really lost because all ive been trying to do was try to be honest with her and how i felt. \n\nbut this is where i really felt and still feel like i was the asshole, maybe i kept poking at something that was never really an issue to begin with until . well, until it actually became an issue. \n\nwe agreed that we needed a break from one another until further notice, so things stayed quiet for about a month.\n\nuntil Z eventually messages me, she comes up to me asking what the hell is going on between me and A and that she wanted answers, so i explain everything from my perspective.\n\ni later realized that was useless because she only messaged me to be angry and \"stand up\" for A.\n\nlong story short, Z told me i shouldve never confronted A in the first place because i should've known she doesnt like confrontation, therefore i shouldnt do it at all and that i was too rude about it, she followed that up by saying she needed to talk to me about topics that shes been holding in, how she felt like she couldnt be her real self around me because she felt like i'd judge her and refused to elaborate when i asked what i said or did to make her feel this way, she seemed to just.. want to be angry at me until she got a negative reaction out of me.\n\nthis eventually led to Z threatening to cut me off, which i ended up telling her to because we weren't getting anywhere and she refused to talk to me while in a better headspace and wanted to resolve things one way or another, so i gave her what she wanted.\n\nanyway, there may be things i need to clarify but AITA here?\n\n",

If you cannot have an honest conversation with friends (its really about tone and delivery) then its like how can one be authentic and real without being able to bring up concerns of grievances?\n\nI think there is a lot of passive aggressive behavior that happens in friendships at that age. I do understand that it is hard to put  this into perspective as I too of course remember being 16. Many of the people you know are either those you knew from childhood or apart of your key social circle. The fear of being alienated from all you know, or the only place where you feel like you belong (often - you find out later that you may have never actually belonged, and you become happy and comfortable with leaving).\n\nI think you should gravitate to those who you best connect with AS LONG AS you're able to truly be yourself or openly express your values. I feel at that age we put so much stock into people we had history with. We imagine \"I'll be friends with this person forever\". The reality of the situation is friends do come and go. I am a 36 M; for reference. I had many people I thought we close friends and we just drifted apart. Time, values, differences. I believe as we get older we realize that we didn't have \"friends\" as much as we had \"friendly acquaintances\". It is crazy how life feels like chapters. With a clear beginning, and a definitive end.\n\nGravitate to the people who make you happy, but more importantly - those you know in your heart care about you and share your values. In any relationship. Those that are healthy for your soul. You will know deep down if they are or aren't.\n\nBe respectful, but above all - be honest. Even if it makes people uncomfortable in the sense as long that its truthful - but not to hurt (I'm not saying go up to a friend and say \"hey, you look fat - but I'm just being honest!). I mean be authentically you. If something bothers you, is repulsive, or something is dangerously stupid - let it be known. In the end, they will respect you more. And just say \"What do you want me to do? Lie? Not speak my mind? How can I do that? To do that means to not even be me, to not be real?\"\n\nIts just all about the tone and delivery. There is something to be said about people where you can say \"I absolutely know what they will say or think - and she (or he) will even back up why they came to that conclusion with logic and reason. Thats a powerful thing that everyone can respect.\n\nWhatever you choose - I wish you the best of luck. Its mindboggling to me that those days were 20 years ago! But here we are LOL.\n\nBest of luck!",
