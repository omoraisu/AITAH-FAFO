      "selftext": "I currently heavily rely on them when it comes to finances, they pay for college through the GI Bill, and most other things, so that I can focus on school. My gf\u2019s (19F) family is moving to a new state. The local college has a much higher standing than the one I currently attend (like top 100 nationally ranked), and would provide more opportunities than the college I currently attend. My parents are the type of people to constantly drill family into my head and ignore what I say. I often feel selfish for wanting to be myself or be independent, my mom is also not accepting of my sexuality. I wouldn\u2019t consider moving schools if I was going to be worse off, but I worry my parents will only see it as me trying to get away from them and follow my gf and her family.\n\nI should mention that my brother (20M) transferred from out of state to and in state college and lives with my parents again. I would be transferring from in state to an out of state college. I don\u2019t live with my parents, but they have my cat who I worry about. They don\u2019t have a problem with transferring, but my brother is more family oriented, and I prefer my freedom and independence. I want to pursue my goals without constantly second guessing because my parents want me to stay close to them.\n\nAnother thing about my parents is just generally the difference in how they treat me versus my brother. He failed his last semester before transferring home, I, on the other hand, have kept straight A\u2019s, I\u2019m involved in school, I\u2019m in the highest distinction of the honors program, and I\u2019m treated like I can\u2019t take care of myself. I\u2019m talked down to no matter what I do. Some examples of this would be when I was sick, I got a doctor\u2019s and was excused from most of my classes except one, but when I brought it up, I got lectured to email the teacher (which I did), send a copy of the note (which I did), and go see the attendance office (while I was sick). Multiple times I told them the absence wasn\u2019t a big deal, didn\u2019t affect my grade, etc., but they just kept going. Another time, my friends from town visited for the weekend because my birthday was that coming Tuesday. We watched horror movies, and just hung out, however, when Tuesday rolled around I was on the phone with my mom, and she not only insulted the gift my gf got me, but she also made me feel bad for spending time with my friends and watching movies because often I\u2019m busy with homework, so she said something along the lines of \u201coh I thought you were busy, why would you spend time watching movies\u201d in a nasty tone. There are other instances, I don\u2019t call my parents very often because I\u2019m made to feel bad constantly, but I worry that a lot of what I\u2019m doing is my own fault, though I never feel like I can do anything right either. Also, when I talk to my parents about where I want to go for vet school, neither of them ever listen. They always ask me where I want to go, even though I\u2019ve repeatedly told them and why, they want me to go to an in state vet school, but that\u2019s not what I want, and I\u2019ve said so. During a recent conversation with my mom, she brought up going in state because she has a benefit that only applies to an in state college, I told her no, I\u2019m going to apply wherever I want and choose the best option. Just generally, it doesn\u2019t feel like my parents listen to what I want, no matter how clear I am about it.\n\nI fear that if I choose to go through with the application process for transferring, there would be a big blow out with my parents. I worry about being able to take my cat with me, but other than that, I would be willing to give up pretty much anything else. I also worry about being able to pay for college without my parents financial support, I would be fine getting a job, but college is still expensive and the degree I\u2019m pursuing requires a lot of schooling. I could probably achieve what I want in the school that I\u2019m at, but I fear being miserable staying close to my family and generally feeling trapped because I\u2019m so dependent on them.\n\nI can clarify anything is need be, I\u2019m probably forgetting things. I worry that my viewpoint is skewed, but other people have overheard phone calls with my parents and also realized how they talk to me. Any advice I would appreciate, I want to be civil with them as I\u2019m not really an argumentative person, but I realize as time goes on, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m in control of my life.",
