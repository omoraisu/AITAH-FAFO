      "selftext": "I am a full time university student that has decided to take a double course load rather than having a part time job. I make my spending money simply by doing odd jobs here and there for my neighbors or extended family. Most of my shopping for the past year has been at thrift stores and flea markets. About 2 weeks ago I saw this really cool Hot-wheels racing track at a flea market for $3. It was in great condition and I cleaned it up very well to the point you wouldn't even realize where it came from. I got it because my Niece loves hot wheels cars but doesn't have any good 'racing track' as she calls it. Well when she opened her gift from me she was ecstatic. She finally had a figure 8 racing track for her cars. I was so happy that she liked the gift. Well towards the end of the party my sister approached me and asked me where I got the track and if I had a receipt for it. (She knows my situation and knows I don't have much money at the moment). I told her I got it from a flea market and tried to explain myself but she insisted that I should not have gotten her daughter anything if it wasn't brand new, because \"A second hand toy is not a gift, it's a burden\". This blew my mind as we grew up below the median income line but she has been fortunate to have a well off husband and good career. Anyways I guess I'm wondering if that is the case now? Do people only want new toys for their kids? I seem to remember it being normal to have second hand stuff. I've been feeling horrible lately and am just wondering if my sister had a point.",
