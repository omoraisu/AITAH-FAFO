      "selftext": "I (37F) have 2 kids (11F and 9M) with my husband (37M), we celebrate Christmas every year with my sister (40F) and brother (42M) and their kids, as well as our parents (67M and 67F). My sister\u2019s oldest is also 11. Her son Sherman is in the same K-6 elementary school my daughter Everleigh is in, they are both in 6th grade. Sherman and Everleigh used to be pretty close, they started drifting apart a few months ago when Everleigh started \u201cdating\u201d Dayton (11M). I thought this was just Everleigh getting caught up in silly preteen love.  \n  \nThat was until Sunday, we invited my sister and brother and their families over to help make baked goods for an upcoming holiday bake sale at the school. Dayton was with us. Once my sister arrived with her kids, Dayton ran into our basement and Everleigh followed him. I wanted to see what they were doing, so I went to go in their and saw they locked the door to the basement, which Everleigh knows she isn\u2019t allowed to do, so I started knocking on the door until Evereleigh opened it and asked me to come inside and talk, so I went in the basement.   \n  \nShe told me that Sherman and his best friend Allan (11M) have a history of bullying Dayton. She gave me multiple examples. Dayton plays basketball and that\u2019s his biggest passion in life, Sherman and Allan have repeatedly called Dayton and his friends \u201cstupid jocks\u201d. This is despite the fact that at a recent trivia bowl at the school, Dayton and two of his basketball teammates beat Sherman, Allan and another boy and won the championship. I was there and didn\u2019t see any problems, but I was told the day after in school, Sherman and Allan said that they only won because of the \u201cc\\*\\*nk\u201d on the team, referring to a Filipino-American boy in their class and a close friend of Dayton. Dayton reported this to the teacher of the class Allan and Sherman are in and both lost recess for a week and got a phone call home. They also mock his religious beliefs. Our family is atheist, and so is Allan\u2019s family. Dayton\u2019s family is also atheist, but he started to go to church with the aforementioned Filipino boy, his family is quite active in the Salvation Army near us and Dayton is a Christian and involved with them. Dayton has never tried to preach to anyone to my knowledge, but he does have a Bible bracelet thing he got off the TikTok shop and wears a cross necklace, I know his faith is important to him and Allan and Sherman have mocked him for praying at lunch.   \n  \nI went up to my sister ans asked to talk to her in my bedroom, I mentioned everything that happened and she said that Dayton and Everleigh were \u201cexaggerating\u201d some \u201clight teasing\u201d and accused their teacher of pushing an agenda to go after Allen and Sherman. She said that she has things under control and not to worry.   \n  \nI went back downstairs and told Everleigh and Dayton to stay down. I told my sister that if she didn't make Sherman apologize, that they would have to leave. She tried to ger Sherman to apologize, but he refused and doubled down. He was laughing and clearly had no remorse for his actions. I told my sister she needed to go home and talk to Sherman.   \n  \nAllan and his family were also supposed to come on the cruise, I was able to get Allan\u2019s mom\u2019s Facebook and messaged her there, she defended her son and called Dayton a \u201ccrybaby\u201d. I tried contacting my sister again, and she started to yell at me for contacting Allan\u2019s mom and trying to \u201cembarrass\u201d the boys. I told her that if she didn\u2019t get her son in line, I would be fine missing the cruise and losing the money and taking my kids and Dayton somewhere nice, and texted Dayton\u2019s parents about what went down, who told me more stories about mean things the boys told Dayton\u2019s other friends.   \n  \nMy mother started texting me after I got off with my sister asking me to pick up. She said that I can\u2019t just abandon my family over this and said that my sister and I need to \u201ccome together and compromise\u201d. I told her that I wasn\u2019t going to compromise on standing against bigoted 11 year old pricks. AITA?",
