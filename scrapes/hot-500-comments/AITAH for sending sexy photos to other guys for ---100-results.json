      "selftext": "So before I started sending photos to other guys, I would send them to my husband. That's how loyal I was to him. We've been together for 7 yrs, 3 kids. Every now and then, I'll feel pretty and sexy, take photos of myself and send them to my husband, sometimes I'm in the mood, I'll send it to him, at work, at home, just randomly during the day. Every time, he tells me \"why?\" and says \"he's seen all of me already!\" his reactions are so lame and boring. I thought no matter how many times we've seen each other, the sexual attraction should still be there, well turns out that's only my part. It's gotten to the point where, he has no reaction at all, none, NA-DA, zero!!!! So, I get disappointed every time, it's a turn off, like dude I barely wear lingerie, I'm barely this sexy (lol), I'm taking photos in ways that I've never done before. Like, I'm so caught up being a mom, but when I'm not busy and caught up, when I have time to myself and feeling myself, dressing up, looking good, he doesnt even initiate sex or anything, it's always me. So, to get my satisfaction, I started secretly sending photos to guys that I've met online, and they give me the reaction that I want, that I crave for from my husband. I get a sense of happiness, that I'm still pretty,  still wanted. My husband makes me feel ugly, unwanted. So am I the asshole? I know some may consider this cheating but damn, I just want to feel attractive and wanted by my husband. I'm only 27 yrs old. Ugh. We got into an argument two days ago because he found out. ",
