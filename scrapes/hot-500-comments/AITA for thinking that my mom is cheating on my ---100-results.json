      "selftext": "So, this story might be long and have a few updates. Here is what is going on right now.\n\nI am a 14-year-old who lives in a small town in Texas we moved here about 6 years ago and have been living with my stepdad a week after we arrived in Texas it all started one day when in summer when I was having a sleep over at my friend's house so this is what went down, we will call my mom Sara and my stepdad Carlos, you can tell by the names that we are Hispanics, and here is what went down somewhere in August so after i got home the next day of my sleepover i was in the car with Sara talking to her friend saying that she was mad at Carlos because the previous night he had shoved a dirty cleaning towel because she \"hadn't cleaned\" something. Then a few days later she started looking for somewhere to move out to and the day she found somewhere Carlos said that if she leaves, he will take away her phone and her car because he paid for both of them at the time so she stopped and then about a week later she found another place and she told my sister who we will call Natalie to ask Carlos if he could give her a white truck that he had and barely used and was planning to sell it, after that Sara asked my brother who we will call David, if he could give her a small black car that he didn't use anymore because he had recently gotten a motorcycle and he was fine with it after that there were a lot of tear from Sara because Carlos said that she was cheating on him and that her best friend was talking things behind her back with her brother who was also her friend because he worked for Carlos and some other things that she doesn't want to tell me and the same day that she found the other house (house #2) i think Sara told Carlos that she had found a house then since he was drinking that day he was a bit intoxicated and so the time that he got inside into the kitchen i walked in because i heard a bit of yelling and and since he had a can of beer he threw it at Sara's face while she was cooking dinner and it got in her eyes so she started crying and yelling to call the police so she went into my Natalie's room to call the police and so anfter that i got a bit emotional so i called the police and told them that i was scared because of what had just happened and the operator told me that an officer was in my area and was close to my home so when they got here Sara was still mad at Carlos and yelling at him because of what had happened and Carlos said that she was cheating on him and she said that if she really was he wouldn't find out so the police told her to stay away from him to prevent future hostility and so they talked to both Sara and Carlos in private so they took away Carlos to the police station but they had to take them to the hospital because he got really bad so David had to go pick him up and after he picked up Carlos fro the hospital he went into Natalie's room to yell at Sara and so she and Natalie called the police again so they came and to prevent more madness they told David if he could take Carlos to a hotel to stay the night so he left and then Sara and Natalie went to sleep because they wanted to move out the next day which they did and i had to come with them. After all that happened Sara talked to Carlos again and we went back to living with him and after that there were more arguments of why she was cheating on him but i am not ging to be talking about those and so fast forward to 3 weeks ago i had gone to work with Sara and she had gone intp the store to buy something when i looked into her glove compartment and found her makeup bag which was small and thin enough to fit in small spaces then the day later Sara told me to help David find something that was in her van drawers and so while i was looking for it i found some makeup remover liquid so i was like \"that's weird why would she have this in her WORK VAN?\"\n\nSo that is what is happening and why I am a bit weirded out because if we move out again I want to go with her but I also want to stay here with my stepdad who played a big role in my life as a paternal figure. So this is why I turn to you reddit for more reasurement on what decision I have to do in case we move out again.\n\nAlso something I forgot to add was that Sara would hit me on a daily basis but not David she would hit Natalie too but because she wouldn't put up food and I beacuse \"I wouldn't clean\" the house.",
