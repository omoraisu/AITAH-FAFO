      "selftext": "(P.S. this is a longgg story) recently I found out my two close friends are dating,but the way I found out made me unsure of how to feel, for some backstory my friend let\u2019s call her Alice and my other friend Josie so Alice had came up to me one day stressing that she thought Josie liked her long story short Josie didn\u2019t but Alice was stressed and was even ignoring her for about a week and that was at least two months before they started dating, so recently while at lunch me and Alice were sitting and talking and I brung up the fact of how she thought Josie liked her but then she look at me and said that their dating now, I was shocked and so was our other friend sitting with us,I asked her how it happened and the reason was so stupid to me, they started dating about a month ago and it was all because of a fucking instagram reel that said \u201csend this to someone you want to date\u201d and Josie apparently said\u201ddate me\u201d and Alice went with it so now here we are, I tell Alice that was a stupid reason to date someone specially if you were stressed that she liked you and you didn\u2019t like her back because she was \u201cto freaky\u201d and that you would never date her, but here you are holding hands with her after repeatedly saying your not even a lesbian, that just made me mad at that point so for the rest of the week I was just bothered by everything they would say and I was also mad at them because they never told me because they thought I knew, HOW WOULD I KNOW IF YOU DIDNT TELL ME? They started laughing thinking I wasn\u2019t actually mad but I was because I tell them almost everything and so do they but they didn\u2019t tell anyone so how would I even know? Anyway, I haven\u2019t texted them or even talked to them for about two weeks because it bothered me, am I the ahole for not talking to them because they\u2019re dating? ",
