      "selftext": "Just for a bit of backstory, I (16M) am no contact with my mother (38F). This is for many reasons such as the fact that she is mentally abusive, or that when I lived with her, she put me and my sisters through so much, like having us without a house and having to live in her car, or when we did have a house, living in literal animal feces. I can go on and on for days about what we lived through.\n\nFinally, she gave up and had me and my sisters go live with our dads because she was home less again. I didn't see her very much while she was homeless, maybe 4 times or so. About a year later, she got a house again, but by this time, I had settled in at my dads house and was doing so much better than I was before and I realized that I was better off staying at my dads. \n\nI didn't want to tell her this, so I kept dodging the question. She was always saying nasty stuff about my dad and saying things like \" I don't want to be alive if I can't see my kids.\" I finally decided to go no contact with her in May 2024. She had a hard time respecting the hard boundaries I set in place. She has tried many things to get access to my life, going as far as to try and contact my school for records. I decided to ask my dad to try and legally amend the court order which is old so that she will no longer have those rights. She was served with the papers a few days ago, and my grandparents told me that she is really upset by this. I've been told this will ruin Christmas. On top of this, both my sisters said they never want to talk to me again in nasty messages. So, AITA? ",
