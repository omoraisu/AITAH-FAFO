      "selftext": "So i have no gallbladder and i plan accordingly lol there was a porta poty down the street from where we were set up to watch the parade. we got pizza and about 30 minutes after we ate my stomach was pissed. so i took my happy ass down the street.\n\nThere was a line but i was the last person so i go in and right as i'm just about done i hear this lady talking to her daughter and i heard her say \"oh the little window is red we have to wait.\". so i'm like ok gotta button and go before the parade starts and as i'm pulling my fucking pants up, not even 20 seconds after she tells her daughter they have to wait she bangs on the door. and then 10 seconds later as i'm about to open the door she bangs on it again. i swing it open and this woman grabs her daughter like i'm about to drop kick the kid but i hold the door open but say \"you just told your daughter that you have to wait and then proceed to bang on the door. kinda defeats the purpose of that teaching don't you think?\"\n\nshe literally got a police officer and walked down the sidewalk to find me. funny enough, officer was a friend from high school so i just waved at him and he laughed. i apparently scared the shit out of her and she thought i was the cause of the medical emergency down the road that delayed the parade....that happened 20 minutes before i went to that stupid porta poty....my only thought is that because i was wearing my husbands flannel and was wearing black jeans and my boots she thought i was gonna shoot someone idfk....i wonder if i had my baby if she would have reacted like that....or said i kidnapped her. who knows lol\n\nanyway AITAH for scaring this poor woman?",
