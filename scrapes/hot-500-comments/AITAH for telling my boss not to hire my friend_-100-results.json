      "selftext": " So I am 20f and my friend is also 20f. We\u2019ll call her Rose. I\u2019ve worked at the same job in food service for a year now, and Rose is recently out of a job so I suggested she apply where I work. A little more incentive is that my job gives and $1,000 bonus if you refer someone to our restaurant and they get hired. Yes you read that right, $1,000. I told Rose this and told her right off the bat that if this happened, I would share the bonus with her. I said I\u2019d give her 1/3 of the bonus, so $333. I thought this was more than generous. Well, apparently I was wrong. \n\nRose applied and eventually had her interview, and I asked her how it had went. She told me she had not told my boss that we were friends and that I had referred her to the company. She said she didn\u2019t think I deserve a bonus if I was going to be \u201cselfish\u201d and not give her half. I was so pissed. In my mind, no real friend would purposefully make it so their friend would not receive a bonus. Especially since I was going to give her 1/3. \n\nSo, the next day at work I told my boss that I knew Rose. I told him I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d be a good fit for the restaurant. She didn\u2019t get hired. When she told me this, I acted shocked but I think she saw through it because she yelled at me and accused me of sabotaging her. We haven\u2019t spoke since.\nPart of me feels bad, but another part doesn\u2019t at all. So, AITAH for this?",
