      "selftext": "Sibling who is narcissistic and has been struggling with paranoia rented a house for Thanksgiving for him, his wife and their child about 1 hour away from my house. His wife advised me several years ago that he bought a gun which is kept in his glovebox in his car after an incident in which he mentioned to our mom that he should commit suicide. I have distanced myself since as I don\u2019t trust him.\n\nHe then proceeded to invite my family to Thanksgiving and refused to give us the address. I found out from my mom tonight that he expected me to put my family (spouse and child) in a car with him driving, leave our car behind and let him drive us to an unknown location approximately 1 hour away at a farmhouse \u2018located on acres of land.\u2019\n\nI refused and said that I\u2019m \u2018Generally not in the habit of getting into cars to go to undisclosed locations in the middle of nowhere\u2026.pretty sure that\u2019s a horror movie though..\u2019 (We refused, of course).\n\nMy mother told me today (her birthday) that she believes I need to apologize for skipping Thanksgiving, that I was wrong for hurting his feelings. And I flipped on her, pointing out how insane it all was. She defended him and said no matter what, that he deserves an apology.\n\nETA: The Thanksgiving thing was this last Thanksgiving.\n\nAITA?",
