      "selftext": "this isn't really an AITA story, I guess it can kinda be though. \n\nSo, I'm posting this on an anonymous account because I really don't know what to do and don't want friends finding it.\n\nI'm not gonna drop any ages here (just for reference everyone mentioned in this story, other than parents, are high-school aged)\n\nI (they/them) have been friends with two people that I am proud enough to call my twins/brothers (no actual relation) for about a year or so, almost 2 now.\n\nWe've had our ups and downs. Me and the one older than me, we'll call him Jasper, (Trans Male), instantly got very close because of a mutual friend, similar relationships, and because of a fallout with a friend group. He's my lifeline, which is where I think the problem lies, but we'll get into that after I even explain what happened. The younger one, we'll call, Kyle (Male), originally was not as close with us, because of some mental struggles he's been having. He's relatively younger than me and Jasper, and we have had to teach him about a few boundaries and respect towards LGBTQ+ people and people with mental disabilities. This incident (if anyone wants me to after posting this, I can sum up a few of the things that happened regarding this) severely drew us away from him until late 2023, early 2024, because he was very disrespectful to me and Jasper before learning why saying certain things werent okay and coming to a happy medium with me and Jasper. Kyle is a great kid otherwise, and I see him as a little brother to me. Around mid 2024, me, Jasper, and Kyle got very close, and after calling Jasper my 'twin' for a while, and becoming his bestfriend, Kyle joined that circle, and we became 'twinsies' / triplets.  \n\nNow, some deeper details.\n\nI have had several diagnosed eating disorders in the past, and I have been diagnosed with OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), MDD (Major Depressive Disorder), and GAD (General Anxiety Disorder). I am getting tested for ADHD (Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder) currently. I have major problems regulating, focusing, registering information, remembering information, isolating, attaching to others, and deescalating. I know that sounds major, but for me, I'm happy that's all. \n\nI am recovering from heavy use of alcohol and weed, and I currently go to therapy bi-weekly. \n\nJasper is diagnosed with MDD, GAD, and is being tested for BPD (Borderline Personality Disorder). He is also taking hormone blockers. He has a rough situation at home, and his girlfriend (Trans Fem) , who we'll call Flower, has it ten times worse than him and has high-functioning autism. \n\nJasper also goes to therapy bi-weekly.\n\nMe and Jasper see Kyle as our little brother we are effortlessly trying to bring up right. We typically say that we want to bring him up better than us, and I completely get it. We did not go through the best things growing up (SA, etc), and while Kyle did too, we don't want him to be at a point where he is taking as much medication as we do, being sent away, or using substances. \n\nNow, fast forward to yesterday. \n\nI woke up around 5am to find that Jasper and Kyle were still awake (Jasper sick, Kyle not able to sleep.) We talked for a little bit, and I told them to go back to bed (I had slept for the entire day the day prior, so I was more than well-rested.) Jasper went back to bed until around 8am, and Kyle didn't (he played on the game instead). Me, Jasper, and Kyle, were planning to go to movies to watch a popular showing (I won't say it here because if they ever see this post it will be obvious that I'm talking about it here). for about a week or so prior to. Yesterday was the day that we would finally go. I was up at 5am, so I decided to get ready ahead of time (the outfit was planned out for about 5 days because I was excited to finally hang out). We were excited, and getting ready to go, when I mentioned on the phone with Kyle that all the seats in the theater were taken. \n\nAnother important note might be that Kyle's parent never booked the tickets. When we realized this we instantly started trying to figure out what we would do. We devised the plan that we would drive to a different movie theater to go see the movie, but Kyle's parent, again, refused to book ahead.\n\nWith that being said, I changed my mind on going to the different movie theater, as to where Kyle ultimately refused to still go to the original one and just hang out instead of going to the different theater to see the movie.\n\nJasper, up at this point (around 8:30 am) was indifferent and just wanted to know what we were planning to do.\n\nMy mom decided to book a different location where we'd have fun stuff to do together afterwards, however, Jasper's parents also refused, saying the location was too far. Kyle's parents also said no because they needed a babysitter for Kyle's siblings and couldn't change the time for the babysitter to be there.\n\nFor some context, the location would be 34 minutes from Jasper, and the original location was 33 minutes away from him. (Little to no difference)\n\nUltimately, we decided to just go to the original movie theater and hang out. However, Jasper's parents unexpectedly, changed their mind, going to the store and a restaurant about the same distance away instead.\n\nNow, this is where it gets bad. After Jasper's parents randomly decided to make the event, I guess, more about them than the kids, Kyle got overwhelmed, and at this point, I was already on the verge of breaking down. Kyle basically said forget it and shut down on the both of us. He left 2 of our main group chats and I followed after realizing.\nThat is where I feel bad.\n\nAfter, I had a breakdown to the point of almost vomiting and violently coughing, blaming myself for the situation and attempting to just get undressed and shut down on myself completely (didnt work because having that bad of a breakdown gets everyones attention). My friends dont know that part, but it happened, and it happened badly. That was the worst breakdown Ive had in a while, and I feel like it set me back a peg.\n\nAfterwards, Jasper basically stopped responding to me. Kyle's parents called me to address the situation, and I heard from Kyle for a while, and also Jasper for a while. However, it has been about 10 hours since I have heard from either of them. I am starting to think that I was the cause of the situation, and I have either been burdening them by venting too much, or by breaking down the way I did today. We did not hang out, and I have to see Jasper tomorrow. I don't know if he wants to see me or not, and they have read my messages several times, but no response.\n\nAITA or is there an A-hole here?? What would you do in my situation?",
