      "selftext": "There's always been a group of us from prep school going into high school, we've had the same group chat, go on the same vacations and spend holidays together for 10+ years however out of the group of us I was the only one not asked to be a bridesmaid. \n\nI don't want to make someone else's wedding about me but it felt intentional, having everyone but 1 of us as a bridesmaid. I guess this means I am not as much of \"one of them\" as I thought. Not sure what to do I am not trying to be selfish, but it really hurts. I also wasn't told and pretended like it didn't exist until I asked the day before. \n\nDo I need to leave my friend group? / stop making them a priority?    ",
