      "selftext": "My son is a college student and lives on campus. My daughter chose not to go to college and works a regular job. Since my son occasionally comes home, he has a bedroom. My daughter has joined the workforce and as an adult, I expect her to pay rent. I charge her $600/mo. and it includes electric, gas, trash, water, internet and food.\n\nDD asked if bf could sleep over at our house and I said no. Daughter respects this but now sleeps at bf house with his family 90% of the time.\n\nDD was fired from a job and didn\u2019t make rent for about 5 months. DD is now working but hasn\u2019t paid December. She\u2019s going no contact because \u201cI\u2019m a narcissist\u201d (my birthday in Sept was awful and TG was a nightmare\u2014lots of passive aggressiveness, rolling of eyes, gossippy whispers to bf). She and son had a convo last week to clear the air of their own disagreements and come to find out DD is pissed because I didn\u2019t allow her to use my son\u2019s bedroom \u201cas an office\u201d since my son is at college anyway. \n\nThere is zero change I would ever agree to displacing my son in favor of daughter having another room (Harry Potter and \u201cDudley\u2019s second bedroom\u201d audacity comes to mind).\n\nDD is pretty much no contact and is listening to her bf\u2019s toxic mother. \n\nAITH?

If she's an adult paying rent, she's entitled to have her bf sleep over (absent bf being a drug dealer or something). It's fair to charge no rent and have conditions like this I think, but if you treat an adult child as a tenant and charge rent, they should have rights too.\n\nAlso, reading between the lines, son at college is also an adult is not charged rent for keeping a bedroom for occasional use. So this sounds more like a judgment, college good, work bad. Which may be an understandable attitude for a teacher (post history, trying not to make assumptions based on mod-deleted posts and being kicked out of a reddit), but seems like it's not because daughter is an adult that she's being charged rent, but because she's not doing what OP wants.\n\nAnd, if DD not there \"90% of the time\" why should she pay rent for December?",
