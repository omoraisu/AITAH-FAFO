      "selftext": "Me (20F) and my best friend (20F) have been best friends ever since the 6th grade, I met a boy (21M) in my freshman year of high school in my biology class and I had a crush on him for a while. Me and him shortly became close after the whole biology thing since we both got separated from all our friends in that class and resorted to talking to each other. I introduced him to my best friend about a month after me and him got close, and they instantly connected. I had already expressed my feelings about him to her, and she fully supported it but it seemed she didn't once they actually first met. December of that year they started dating, and I didn't get upset about it to her (might I add, she was the one who had apparently made every move). I decided to ask her about it anyway, just saying, \"I was just curious why you flirted with him so much, you knew I liked him?\" which she replied with something along the lines of, \"that's not my fault you also liked him, but in the end we really found out who he liked more,\" and I decided not to ask further. They dated all the way to college, it really seemed like they'd get married one day. I was always the third wheel, because I was super close with the both of them, and I didn't mind much. She broke up with him a few months ago for a different, more wealthier man than him and he's been absolutely heartbroken ever since. Last week, I came to his apartment asking if he needed anything since he was still absolutely out of it, like barely leaving his house out of it. My intention was not to hook up or anything like that, just wanted to be there for a friend, and at this point I had lost all feelings for him. He decided he wanted a movie night, like me and him use to have in high school. I sat a fair distance away from him, since he wasn't my boyfriend or anything, I didn't needed to be all cuddled up next to him. But it felt like the entire movie he was inching toward me, and at the end of the movie he just kissed me out of nowhere. I was shocked, of course, because all my feelings for him were gone and he went on this whole rant about how in love with me he has always been. I was just shocked and I just totally gave in. The next morning we decided to make things official, and a day later he posted a picture of me captioned, \"the love of my life,\" without my permission. My best friend totally blew up on me, and I replied with, \"you knew I always liked him and you still got with him, I know you two broke up but I'm still getting with him. Just doing the same thing you did,\" and I feel bad about that now and guilty for being with him. I'm sure I'm the a-hole for this but I don't know. ",
