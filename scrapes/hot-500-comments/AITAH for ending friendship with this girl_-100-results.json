      "selftext": "\nHere\u2019s the situation: she was an old friend of mine, and I found out she had a crush on me after she confessed. At the time, I didn\u2019t feel the same way, but after about a year, I started to like her. The problem is, she takes forever to respond to my messages. If I text her today, she won\u2019t reply until three days later.\n\nWhen I brought this up to her, she always had excuses. She\u2019d say things like, \u201cI\u2019ve changed,\u201d or \u201cI\u2019m like this with everyone because of past trauma.\u201d Other times, she\u2019d just claim she was busy, but then I\u2019d see her posting on social media like nothing was wrong.\n\nEventually, I decided to end the friendship and told her so. But she begged me not to, saying, \u201cPlease don\u2019t! There are things I want to tell you, but it\u2019s not the right time yet.\u201d When I asked what they were, guess what? I had to wait three days for her reply.\n\nIt\u2019s exhausting, and I can\u2019t deal with it anymore. I\u2019ve decided this friendship isn\u2019t worth it\u2014it\u2019s time to let it go.\n\nI know that she doesn't have to respond my messages because she lost her crush feelings for me but still at least be honest and say \"I don't want to talk to you anymore go away\"\n\n",
