      "selftext": "TW! Abuse and Self Harm\n\nIf my misspelling is off, I apologize because I literally was up for 24/7 because of this nonsense of what I\u2019m about to tell you. \n\nOkay so I (21f) and Alicia (21f) have known each other since middle school. Our friendship has some ups and downs to a point that she even blocked me at one point (although we are on good terms atm). Throughout the recent years I\u2019ve discovered that she has borderline personality disorder. I now understand why she has her \u201csplit\u201d moments. \n\nNow here is the real problem tho\u2026 After when I helped her get out of an abusive relationship with her fianc\u00e9 Devyn (24M), she became extremely needy. I know it\u2019s gonna sound wrong but please hear me out. When she vents to me about when something goes wrong, she would get suicidal and threaten to harm herself. When I told her that maybe she needs to go to a mental hospital for some extra help, she started screaming at me on the phone. While she was screaming at me, I hung up the call because I\u2019ll admit, that triggered my PTSD. About 2 hours later she apologized to me sincerely, and told me that she had a split moment. She thought that I was abandoning her all because I mentioned about her going to a mental hospital. I accepted her apology after the blow out.\n\n2 months after when she got out of the relationship, her new fianc\u00e9 Kyle (30m) she is now having problems with him all because he is in prison. She literally keeps on texting me everyday, and it\u2019s driving me batshit crazy. It\u2019s so bad that I even had to mute her so I wouldn\u2019t get notifications from her. Not to mention that if I respond to her two seconds late, she\u2019ll be like \u201cSorry to bother you, I won\u2019t bother you again\u201d. Like dude, I can\u2019t even use my own bathroom in peace for like 2 seconds? I am seriously considering blocking her for good out of my life because it\u2019s all so draining to me. But then again, she told me that I was one of her longest friends and that she\u2019ll be devastated. She made serious suicidal threats before to point that it gets me scared that I don\u2019t know what to say. But if I say the wrong thing like go to a mental hospital, she\u2019ll have her split moment on me again. So please be honest with me. AITA for considering blocking her? ",
