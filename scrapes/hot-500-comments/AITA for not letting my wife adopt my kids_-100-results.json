      "selftext": "I (30m) have two kids ages 8 and 9, with my ex. My ex is still alive but she was in a car accident two years ago and requires around the clock care now so she's not able to be an involved mother to our kids. She and I were friends who tried being more but worked better as friends. I still love her as a friend. I visit. My kids visit. And my kids love their mom.\n\nI was dating my wife (30f) when my ex had her accident. We got married a year ago. She loves my kids and has mentioned that she'd like to adopt them. I had some mixed feelings on that and I spoke to my kids, just a general talk with no pressure to give an answer either way, but neither were on board. They didn't want a new mom. Which I respect. I told my wife I didn't think her adopting the kids was the right thing to do and at first she appeared to accept it. She told me she was disappointed but she also said she understood. But that wasn't the end of it and she has asked me why, she has asked me to reconsider, she told me about the benefits of her adopting them and she said she doesn't want to be considered a lesser parent because she's stepmom and not mom.\n\nMy kids feelings have remained unchanged. They like my wife but they do not consider her their mom.\n\nMy wife said I'm being unfair. That she's actively involved in the kids, she wants to mother them and to give them a mom back and she said I'm not letting her. She said if something happened to me she'd lose the kids and they'd lose her and when we have kids they'd be separated. I told her I wanted to act in my kids best interest and that's where my decisions come from. \n\nMy wife feels I'm unreasonable. She feels like I'm using her. She doesn't do all or even most of the child raising. She is a huge part of it but I'm very involved and active. I don't want her to feel used but I don't want to force this on my kids and honestly, it feels disrespectful to the mother of my children. But my wife feels I'm not respecting her.\n\nAITA?",

You need to talk to a lawyer and to set up a will with guardianship provisions in the event something happens to you, whether you want them to go with your wife or someone else. And the fact that your ex is alive but incapacitated probably complicates that. But a decent family law/probate attorney should be able to get it sorted.",

They don&#39;t think about what would happen if dad died. I think op is wrong to just ask them what they want. He needs to think about the legalities and what he thinks is best for the kids. I&#39;m not saying that adoption is the best solution but he does need to think about it and plan. I woukd probably put in my will that she is to become their legal guardians.</p>\n</div>",

I would confront her about that. I don&#39;t know what state you live in, but maybe, she feels like she&#39;s got something to gain by adopting the kids and something to lose by not adopting the kids. Which makes me concerned about her motives. Stand your ground. It doesn&#39;t make sense to me, and I&#39;m a mother.</p>\n</div>",

This is a very important decision for everyone involved and I wouldn't blame the stepmom if she walked away over this.\u00a0\n\n\nAnd honestly, the kids are a bit young to understand all this, so it shouldn't be their decision alone either.\u00a0",

Their mother can&#39;t parent them and is unable to consent to anything based on what sounds like a serious brain injury. She needs around the clock care, I think you severly underestimate the reality here.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>So, what the stepmom will receive is sercurity for herself and the kids. Life has shown her once how fast something could happen. This isn&#39;t about love or pushing the kids to abandon the bio-mom, it&#39;s about security and a right to be an equal parent when it comes to school, travelling, doctor appointments, inheritance, parental role if something was to happen to op and so on and on.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>I get that dad and the kids are uncomfortable with the idea, but there is no reason to paint this involved stepmom as a monster for this. This is a very important decision for everyone involved and I wouldn&#39;t blame the stepmom if she walked away over this.\u00a0</p>\n\n<p>And honestly, the kids are a bit young to understand all this, so it shouldn&#39;t be their decision alone either.\u00a0</p>\n</div>",

It would mean that your children\u2019s birth mother *is no longer their legal mom*. \n\nThis has far more implications than most non-adopted people assume. \n- if you are in a state where adoption forces the birth certificate to change, it can be harder to get a passport and other identity documents. An amended birth certificate issued after one year of age is no longer sufficient to prove citizenship according to passport regulations, and the children will need additional early-life records (immunization records or early school records are most common) to prove that they are citizens.\n- legally, they are not next of kin to their mother. That means that when their mother dies, they may not be notified as next of kin (I wasn\u2019t when my biological mother died; I was only informed when my biological brother who was not adopted called me), and they *will* be denied any medical records after their biological-but-not-legal kin have died. I cannot get my own medical history because my dead mother isn\u2019t my mother. I will be able to get the medical history of my adopted parents for my own medical history, but it\u2019s not my medical history! Any inherited conditions they have can\u2019t possibly pass to me!\n- any future siblings/cousins/anything on that side are no longer legal kin.

But the grandparents are still alive and still kin, and if it comes to a court battle about who gets the kids, I lose because I\u2019m not legally related and they are.\n- in inheritance issues, if your children\u2019s biological mother leaves anything at all behind without a will, your children are not kin and cannot claim it.

People treat it similarly to transferring a vehicle title and getting ownership of the child, as though it isn\u2019t the child\u2019s very identity.
