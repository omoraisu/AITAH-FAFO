      "selftext": "Hi Reddit, I (18M) was asked by my roommate to go to the bank and get the cash he needed to pay the cash part of the rent. I was already annoyed this weekend by him instinctively closing the bathroom door which caused it lock on the other side and not being able to open it which made me stay late to the night while im supposed to sleep early for the SAT test on Dec 7th. He was laughing and took a picture for snapchat when it happened as i was struggling to open it because the toilet had all my toilet equipment from toothbrush to my deodrant and perfume which made me stink and and uncomfortable going to the SAT because i had to wait till tomorrow for a locksmith to open it for me and the landlord didnt gave us keys for the bathroom.\n\nSo today on my way back from the library he asked me to get the cash for his part of the rent, I asked him to transfer the money to my account then i will do it. He didn't transfer all of the money and told me to pay the rest in which he would give me later. I was concerned that i might forget or he won't pay the remaining dollars back. The ATM was closed on Sunday so i had to walk back to the apartment and i transferred back the money he gave me. Later today as i was making lunch for myself, he said that im the greediest person he ever saw and that he wanted to slap me. It irritates me because i had my suspicion and didn't want to be used and asked the question just as an assurance and because of the bathroom door issue having concerns about him. I have to stay with him till May 1 when i come back to my home country.\n\nAITA for being suspicious of him not giving me the full amount which made him mad? was there a better way to approach this situation because i find weird that him calling me a greedy person is taking that toll on me and feeling bad.",
