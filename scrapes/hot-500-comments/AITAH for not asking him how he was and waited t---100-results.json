      "selftext": "\n\nI NEED ADVICE.\n\n1. I was not a good partner during 1st year marriage. I was emotional and had a poor emtional regulation. I worked it out. We're now on our 7th year and I am 7months pregnant. \n\n2. Pregnancy is wonderful until I hit my 7th month. I feel dumb, I cant focus and I do stupid thing. I dont understand my emotion.\n\n3.Last week, he was sending me to work. Other driver was being a jerk to him on the road. I was surprised but my mind went blank. I dont know how to react. So I just left for work without saying anything.\n\n4. When he picked me up, I said sorry for not saying anything earlier. He just ignore me. I tried again after few hours and he ignored me. When i get home, I settle my self first then i fell asleep. when i woke up, I approach him and said sorry again. He got mad and say that why do i have to say sorry at my convenience. Why cant i say it in the car? \n\n5. He said he is not speaking to me ever again and if I cannot live in such marriage, I can go back to my parents.\n\n6. I tried to open up and say that I also having a hard time understanding myself during pregnancy. I did stupid things. I hated it and i never want to hurt him with my action. He got more pissed off saying im just using my pregnancy as an excuse. He said, there are many woman in the world is pregnant but dont do stupid thing like me. He rolled his eyes when i open up like this.\n\n7. I said i want to work out. He said I do not have anything to offer anymore. He said I can go for a diviorce if I want. And even so things will be easier for me. Because my family loves me while him, he'll just be alone and die alone like his father. (he's from broken family). \n\n8. He is giving me silent treatment. I feel stuck, I feel helpless. I understand i made a mistake, and I want to work it out but he is shutting me down.\n\n\nAll in all, i feel i deserved this...I start to lose hope. I kept thinking about my baby and his future. I am in serious need of advice. ",
