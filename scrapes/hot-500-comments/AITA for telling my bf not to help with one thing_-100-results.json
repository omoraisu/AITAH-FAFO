      "selftext": "Hi there.\nI (28F) am at my wits end. I'm just tired. My boyfriend (28F) changes his attitude quicker than my mood swings and I don't know how to deal with it.\n\nThis morning he was super sweet cuddly and adorable, and while we were in the kitchen I was starting to make breakfast. \n\nI don't know if I do, but I highly suspect to have ADHD because I strain to focus on a task, if I happen to do one thing I struggle to do another or even completely forget about the one thing I was doing. This'll come in important later.\n\nSo while I was doing breakfast, I forced myself to make the times line up (e.g put bacon in first so I can make coffee while it cooks). My bf asked me when his coffee will be ready so my brain short-circuited and I started making coffee, completely forgetting to set the timer on the air fryer etc. \n\nTrying to be helpful he suggested he'd do the coffee, except I've got my own way of doing it and usually measure it with muscle memory (cafetiere). When I told him no thanks he immediately storms off saying \"The one time I try to help and it's not good enough!\" So I offered he could wash a cup or two and I just get a \"Oh so now you want my help?\" \n\nDefeated I give up, and I just carry on. Both in a bad mood, I asked him (tiredly) how many bacon rashers he'd like and he just says he doesn't care, doesn't want any. So I'm asking him ok do you want coffee? And he goes \"No don't fancy it anymore\"\n\nAnd I'm so. So tired. AITA for telling him no to help with the cafetiere? I'm just genuinely trying to see where I went wrong and where is attitude came from but even when I ask nicely he just shrugs and doesn't talk to me.",
