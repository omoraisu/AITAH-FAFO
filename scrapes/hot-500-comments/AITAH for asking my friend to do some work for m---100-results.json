      "selftext": "Im an artist (30/m) and im currently working hard on a new exhibition of works for a couple of months time. I\u2019m under a lot of pressure and it\u2019s quite overwhelming the sheer amount of work I need to get done. To compensate for this I asked my friend (24/m) to stretch some canvases in exchange for cash, I\u2019m paying him per canvas he stretches instead of per hour because he has a habit of not really doing much work over wise. He\u2019s always asking me for odd jobs for money and I feel kinda bad for him sometimes as he lives with his parents and does freelance film work mostly for a living. I used to do similar work so I guess I understand the hustle.\n\n\nAnyway recently he found out that I was visiting Sydney to see my boyfriend who is dog sitting at his parents house, Sydney is around a 14-16 hour drive from where I live and he asked if he could come along, I said sure as I wouldn\u2019t mind having someone to share the drive with as it\u2019s quite gruelling. \n\n\nThis was all fine until last week when he told me out of the blue he needed to use my car for 4 days to then travel down to Wollongong which is 3 hours south of Sydney, I didn\u2019t want him to use my car and I said no you can take the train. He wanted to use it so he could take his film gear to shoot and video and bring back a surfboard he had brought.\nWell I guess this is where the trouble begins, I asked him if maybe he would do some extra work for me for free, 4-5 hours of work, priming canvases in exchange for using the car. He said sure and came over and did about 3 canvases. Maybe half an hour of work.\n\n\nThe next day he calls me up kinda randomly and says it\u2019s fucked how much work I\u2019m getting him to do for free and that actually I should be paying him to prime these canvases as well as stretch them because it\u2019s very difficult work.\nI then later found out from a friend that he (maybe hyperbolically) said I was making him do slave labor.\n\n\nI just found this all so frustrating and immature. Not only is he getting a free trip to Sydney, he\u2019s also using my car and getting a few night of free accomodation in my boyfriend\u2019s parents house. He then sent me a weirdly cryptic message along the lines of \u2018 don\u2019t sell the lifestyle without the terms and conditions.\u2019 And has has commented on my instagram posts about \u2018paying for your art assistant\u2019.\n\n\nI am seriously considering just paying him for the work he has done and going to Sydney alone. He would then lose money on the flight back that he has already paid for.\nAm I the asshole for asking him to do this work in exchange for the Sydney trip and car?\n\n",
