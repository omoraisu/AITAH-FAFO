      "selftext": "Hello f 21! I recently turned 21 and for my 21st birthday I decided to get an air bnb with a few friends! I paid for the air bnb itself and my friends just had to pay for food and drinks. That being said my best friend really ruined it for me and honestly made me extremely uncomfortable. \n\nThe first night there I had told everyone that I didn\u2019t what to share a room and wanted to be alone! ( all the girls had their own beds) once we get situated we go out to grab breakfast for tomorrow and food for that night so we can cook and eat at home- once we get back we all start drinking, cooking, smoking, and overall having fun! Throughout that night I had wayyyy way way to much to drink and got sooo messed up that I apparently had stripped out of my clothes. My homegirl Pam was putting pajamas on me and helped me get into bed ( this is what I was told my two other friends) when I woke up the next morning my closest friend Rebecca was in the bed with me and I was fully nude. I was a bit uncomfortable especially because I was naked but also because I had told everyone I didn\u2019t what to share a bed with anyone! So I wake up grab my clothes and go get some water. Everyone slowly starts to awake and so yada yada yada..\n I go to check my phone and I saw that Rebecca had posted a video of me on her close friends - I was obviously naked and Pam was putting clothes on me. She had to censor half the video out that\u2019s how I knew I was naked. Soo I automatically exit out of the app and walk out the room ( I didn\u2019t confront her right away because she doesn\u2019t take well to being confronted as well as just wanting to keep the peace. There was already a bit of attitude coming from her before we even got to the air bnb) on top of that as soon as we get to the air bnb she is crying and isolating herself ( I had to step away and ask her why and she just refused to answer me; which also dampened my mood because i mean who wants to have fun when their friend is crying yk?) \nSo I just left the video alone and continued on with my day. That same day we were supposed to go to downtown Disney, out to eat, and get piercings, then come back home and eat and drink again. I wanted to be at downtown Disney at 11:30 am- ( we all knew what time to be ready by and what the plan was as this is something that was spoken about numerous times in the group chat) Rebecca caught an attitude with me because I said everyone has 90 minutes to get ready. She was mad and said I was rushing her. She ended up taking about 4 hours to get ready\u2026 while everyone was ready in under 90 minutes. We didn\u2019t get to downtown Disney until 2:30. Once we get to downtown Disney we walk around do a bit of shopping and Rebecca and my other friend yemi start bickering. I had to change my shoes because my feet were hurting. So Rebecca and yemi are bickering over which ones are better the white or black ones. I end up getting the black ones and Rebecca gave 2 snarky remarks. It was very tense after that. So we all decide to grab some margaritas but Rebecca was hungry so we tried to look for something to SNACK on! We had food at the air bnb ( a lot of it- dip, chips, cake, cookies, eggs, gravy, etc) so we found a little ice cream and as we are there Rebecca decides to leave and look for food ( I was already pissed off because she took forever to get ready, then she was passive aggressive to one of my friends, as well as was giving snarky remarks towards me and talking about yemi to me) so once she leaves I decide to continue walking around and doing my own thing. As we are walking I step away to catch a breath and calm down. Once I was away another one of the girls name Marsha decided to go look for Rebecca- so Rebecca and Marsha come back and she ( Rebecca) is like oh I found a place to eat! ( mind you everyone agreed that we weren\u2019t hungry\u2026 we also would be cooking and eating very heavy that night) so we walk to the restaurant that rebacca wanted to go to only for me to realize her and Marsha are eating by themselves.  I was in the back so once I caught up they were already walking into the restaurant just by themselves. We walked for a little over an hour before I texted Rebecca asking where she was at- she had told me that her and Marsha were waiting and just now got their food. So I texted her asking her to package their food up because we have to start leaving. She ignored me. So I ended up texting Marsha and she\u2019s like \u201c we are already done\u201d so Rebecca had lied to me ( I also knew she lied because she had posted pictures that Marsha had took over her on her instagram) Also to add on I wanted to take pictures because I loved my outfit and had asked Rebecca to take pictures of me. She usually does very well but that day she was doing TERRIBLE! She was literally not listening and just felt like she was trying to sabotage my pics\u2026 and so afterwards I ended up taking her pics but I tried to do a different angle because the way she had mine the sunlight was ruining it. So she ( Rebecca) gets mad and goes \u201c take them right like I did yours\u201d very aggressively\u2026 so anyway that day I had made the decision that I was going to cut her off. The last month and a half I had already gotten bad vibes and have been feeling like this friendship was very one sided. That being said I am an early bird! I am usually asleep by 10. Everytime I was falling asleep she was screaming and shaking my head to keep me up. And she was doing this to just me nobody else. So needless to say Sunday comes me and a few of the girls age sitting outside talking- yemi tells me how Rebecca was trying to get into my room last night around 2-3 am ( I had locked my door because of the previous night) which yemi wasn\u2019t lying because around 2 am I woke up to someone trying to get into my room. I just didn\u2019t know it was her. So I also asked them why they didn\u2019t put pajamas on me and that\u2019s when they had told me they did put pajamas on\u2026 we all collectively agreed that it\u2019s weird I went to sleep with clothes then woke up naked next to Rebecca. So we ate chit chatting and then decide to start cleaning up to leave. Rebecca and Marsha didn\u2019t help clean anything at all the entire trip- they also spent most of their time on their phones and not trying to be part of the group. So when it\u2019s time to leave I have to take Marsha and Rebecca home. It\u2019s very quiet on the ride and obviously tense. I am a person where my feelings show on my face. So a few minutes before I drop Marsha off Rebecca asked me if I was mad at her- I simply told her we\u2019d talk later. As soon as I dropped Marsha off Rebecca went in to use the bathroom. About 35 minted later we were at Rebecca\u2019s house. I couldn\u2019t even look Rebecca in the eye as I had felt uncomfortable and disappointed in our friendship. Me and Rebecca had been inseparable since March. We\u2019ve done everything together so seeing how she acted towards me this previous weekend was very disheartening. As soon as I got home I texted Rebecca saying I wanted to stay in low contact. After that I went to Instagram to remove her off my accounts only to realize she had blocked me. After that I made the decision to send her a message expressing how I felt uncomfortable, how I don\u2019t think this is a friendship I want, and how her behavior was unacceptable. As soon as I sent that message I blocked her.  Now almost 12 hours later she has sent me 5 messages off two fake accounts on TikTok. She hasn\u2019t taken accountability but instead has tried to gaslight me, manipulate me, and make it seem she is the victim. I just need to know am I in the wrong for this? Everyone I\u2019ve talked to has said no and what she did was not okay. But they are my friends so I need an outside POV- I also have not responded to anything she has said but instead have just continued blocking accounts. I\u2019ve said what I needed to say and the fact she would rather have the last word ( which this is what she said to start off with \u201c you got to say your piece so I am saying mine\u201d than to see that her actions have made me feel uncomfortable is just really crazy to me. I\u2019ve explained how she didn\u2019t take them with my consent and she still doesn\u2019t see an issue. So am I just being over dramatic? Should I respond to her text? I just don\u2019t know what to do and if blocking her was right. I know a boundary of mine was crossed but am I being irrational? ",
