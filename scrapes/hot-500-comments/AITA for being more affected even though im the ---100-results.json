      "selftext": "Hello, im new to reddit and I just wanted peoples insights on my situation, so please bare with me and feel free to judge and be raw with your wordings.\n\nSo, me and my ex dated for 1 year and 4 months, but we've been talking/we've known each other for 2 years and those 2 years, we were already flirting with each other and basically committed to one another. Let's call her Blue (19) for this story since I want to keep it anonymous cs she might have reddit, (I'm 19 as well btw).\n\nFor more context, our love story ended 2 months ago mostly due to her moving to another country, we're WLW, and she's my first gf irl but not my first relationship becauce I've messed around online with people (edate) but never really irl so I'm sort of experienced with dating. We dated irl, and 6 months ago she moved to California, I'm in the Philippines and she didn't really have a choice but to go since that was her family.\n\nBefore we even became official, I was already aware that she was gonna move since she told me early on (1st month we talked) but I just never expected that time would fly by so fast and that 2 years would come by as a blur. The day she told me she was about to leave in a few days, we've already had a discussion that I might break up with her due to my trauma from LDR (Basically while I was in an ldr with my first love/the first person I committed to, she lied abt still having feelings for me and loving me even tho that wasn't what she felt and she reassured me that she did even tho she didn't so that was the reason I broke up with her, this made me develop trust issues with ldr hence why I stopped with the edating and moved to rl dating.) I even told Blue that me and her should break up while she was still here bcs I genuinely couldn't handle if she moved, but still I pushed on because the guilt of breaking up with her while she's in a new country with a new school and new sorroundings got me. I didn't want to abandon her during that situation so I pushed my trauma aside and stayed strong for Blue.\n\nIn those first few months, 1st-2nd month, I cried every night because I genuinely had the biggest trust issues I was overthinking every minute but I didn't let it affect me from loving her, and FYI I did communicate to her about all of this and she was aware the whole time.\nI stayed with her, stayed strong for her and us during those tough times, I also wanted this to be proof that I loved her. That despite me being traumatized with LDR, I still pushed on. \n\nThe LDR began to get VERY rocky, specially in the 3rd month, we broke up like 4 or 3 times because of it but got back together, my mental health was starting to get worse and I was the one initiating the break ups. I was telling her that I was overthinking more and I felt as if I don't belong in her world anymore, I didn't get reassurance for that. It honestly felt so unfair that  I kept my composure for her and stayed strong despite what I was feeling towards the situation, I was really drained but I wanted us to work so most of the time I pushed it aside. Blue was my first everything. On the 4th break up, I told her I wanted a mental health break, but realized that us not together made it worse. We were still talking atp and honestly I was relying on her for strength because I had none in me, It all got drained from trying in those first few months of the LDR. \n\nEventually, she started changing, she started pushing me away, began acting cold, distant, and all of that stuff. Despite that treatment, she said she still wanted a future with me but treated me worse than a stranger would. \n\nShe said she was acting like that in order for me to move on, and I told her that what she was doing was something I only thought of doing but never did so because I knew how badly it would hurt her and me. Yet she did it for what? \"My sake\" fucking bullshit. I told her that that's not how you love someone and she blamed her inexperience with relationships, I replied with it's common sense and doesn't require experience. I begged for her to stop and to stay because I needed her and I loved her. \n\nHonestly, it feels as if she only used me to settle in first, it felt as if she only kept me close in order not to feel alone in those first few months. Like, how can one move on so fast? (Yes she did mention that she doesn't want to try again but has said \"she still wants a future with me\") No, she's not seeing anyone else I believe. \n\nThere was the time my health was really getting worse due to staying up all night crying my eyes off, frequent headaches and I barely ate. I vomitted blood and I told her about it, I vented to her about how my health was getting worse because she said \"I could always run to her whenever something was wrong and that she would always listen\" and I did vent and rant to her twice about some family problem and other problems stacking up with led me to hurting myself, and she said I was guilt tripping her and that she wasn't my mom and that she didn't have any responsibility over me (which is true I guess ;/) so I stopped relying, messaging and stuff. But occasionally I'd lose to the desire to be with her and beg her to come back again. \n\nAnyway, we don't talk anymore, I stopped messaging her and had a 6 day streak when she suddenly apologized yesterday morning, (she never gave me a proper apology and never honestly apologized for treating me like shit) and stated it was her last message, honestly she just wanted to be in \"good terms\" because of the guilt she carried \ud83d\ude07 lol. I told her that im not gonna consider that we're in good terms and that I'd always be bitter over her but I wouldn't act on my emotions anymore. I told her I'd be waiting for her if ever decides to come back and she said to stop hoping because she's not coming back lmfao that honestly hurt but I didn't cry cs im lowkey tired of feeling things for her, but despite that I still do love her since she is my greatest love and everything, but im not hoping anymore, sure I'm still waiting but it doesn't mean I'd do bad without her, with or without her im ok. Honestly I've been doing better, I don't have the urge to message her but I still long for her and will be waiting. It might never happen and that's okay. \n\nIt ends here, If you have questions feel free to ask, and also idk if the story sounds cringe, I do acknowledge my faults like I'm the one that broke up with her and shit but it was tbh just my strength fading away and at those times I needed her to be strong for us because I was tired from fighting and she never fought for us.\n\nSo, AITA?\n\nEdit: I also do need advice on how to move on she did it in under a week ",
