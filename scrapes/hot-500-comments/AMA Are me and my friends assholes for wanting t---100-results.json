      "selftext": "Hi guys first time posting here but this is genuinely the first time me and my friends are frustrated with something. To sum it up, our friend group always celebrate our annual Christmas Party somewhere. We happened to stumble this resort it has a good atmosphere and food based on pictures and videos. Because of that we decided to reserve a ktv room for 25 people. We contacted their customer service to confirm our reservation. Glow and behold they responded by showing us their hourly rates and pictures of their ktv rooms. We decided to ask if KTV room 5 was available because we really liked the design of it and 30 minutes later they responded with only KTV 4 was available so me and my friends agreed to go for it anyways because the place was really hard to miss out on. The customer service themselves said that there was an AVAILABLE slot for December 14 and my friend who was talking to them agreed on that date. The following day they decide to send us a form we have to fill up and their rules and regulations. We filled up the form and they suddenly said that there are no more available rooms for that date?? They said that we need to pay a down payment in order for the reservation to go through like what? We literally agreed on that date the day before and they drop this to us rn? Obviously frustrated we said that we agreed on the date and the room but they said they do not give confirmation unless down payment was made but in the form there was NO evidence of any number because we use GCASH to pay and obviously we need their number in order to actually pay but NO THERE WAS NO NUMBER GIVEN AT ALL IN THE FORM MEANING PAYING FOR THE DOWN PAYMENT IS GENUINELY IMPOSSIBLE. So my friend replied and I quote \"Pardon me for being rude, but this is unfair to me as the customer since you didn't inform me sooner about the registration form because how will I send the date and time without it? when I confirmed my reservation I had to ASK for the form, do you get it? Not only that, but you said in the rules & regulations that on quote \"You may pay your reservation fee via Gcash or bank transfer.\" But then you are saying that you do not send gcash numbers or qr codes so that your customers reserving online can proceed with their down payment? honestly that doesn't make any sense. And lastly you're gonna say that you do not give confirmation unless down payment is done but you don't even make it possible for your customers to actually PAY.\" We were really pissed at first but after the customer service seened our message, they BLOCKED my friends account who was talking with them. Despite trying to criticize and explain to them properly, they decide to block us without explanation. And that is why we really wanted to review bomb this place but I want to ask for yall's opinion. Thanks for reading this far if ever you did.",
