      "selftext": "AITAH for unleashing a legal team on my ex wife because she allowed her boyfriend to co sleep with my daughter for 5 plus years? I even had to take DCYF on and I won because the judge gave me a letter that if he\u2019s in the bed again he\u2019s in contempt of court. My fear was he was grooming her. He has two adult daughters that have nothing to do with him and he\u2019s a total nerd. He gives me pedo vibes. I had to deal with my daughter breaking my door down and not being able to have stable relationships with women because where I dated and had them on my weekends, any long therm partner felt awkward because my ex wife slept in the bed with her or her boyfriend did for so many years she had to have human contact next to her. This meant I had to do the same on my weekends to put her to sleep and then I had to carry her into her bed, only for her to wake up screaming and run to break down my door. This is my daughter. This is the most protected thing in my life. No father should have to deal with this let alone pay a lawyer to protect her because dcyf sides with a mother who lies under oath. So am I the asshole for unleashing hell to protect my kid? ",
