      "selftext": "I 18F have been dating my boyfriend 19m for about a year now, and things have been great...until recently. I live in a small one-bedroom apartment that I pay for myself with a part-time job and some help from financial aid while I\u2019m in college. My boyfriend doesn\u2019t live with me, but he stays over a lot.\n\nHere\u2019s the issue: his best friend 20M recently got kicked out of his parents\u2019 house. He\u2019s been couch-surfing, and my boyfriend asked if he could move in with me \u201cfor a little while\u201d until he gets back on his feet.\n\nI told him no. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like his friend\u2014we get along fine\u2014but I barely have enough space for myself. Plus, I\u2019m not comfortable having someone else live in my home, especially someone I don\u2019t know super well. I told my boyfriend he\u2019s welcome to let his friend crash at his place (he lives with roommates), but my apartment isn\u2019t an option.\n\nNow my boyfriend is upset, saying I\u2019m being selfish and \u201cnot helping someone in need.\u201d He said it\u2019s \u201cjust temporary,\u201d and that as his girlfriend, I should be more supportive of the people he cares about. His friend hasn\u2019t said anything to me directly, but I can tell he\u2019s kind of salty about the situation.\n\nI feel bad that his friend is in a tough spot, but I also feel like I have the right to say no to someone living in my space. My boyfriend is acting like I\u2019m heartless for not helping out, and it\u2019s making me second-guess if I\u2019m doing the right thing.\n\nSo, AITAH for refusing to let my boyfriends best friend move in?",
