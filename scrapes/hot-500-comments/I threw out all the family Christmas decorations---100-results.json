      "selftext": "I 28F was given all the family Christmas decorations and the family tree last year before my parents sold the house and went on a 7 month long vacation. \n\nI had told them I didn\u2019t want the Christmas decorations as I do not celebrate Christmas and don\u2019t put up any decorations. I also do not have the space to keep the decorations long term, I suggested they pay for a storage unit for the stuff but they decided against it. They said it was cheaper to have me keep it in my house even though the stuff was taking up space in my office making it difficult for me to access my things.\n\nA few weeks into their trip I had already tossed out the Christmas decorations and sold the tree on FB marketplace.\n\nParents are now asking for the stuff back and I had to let them know I threw it out. This caused major issues and they are refusing to talk to me. \n\nIf they had listened to me and brought a storage unit or found another family member to hold the stuff this wouldn\u2019t have happened but they didn\u2019t. \n\nI live in a small two bedroom house with basically no storage, I\u2019m pretty minimalist so the lack of storage never bothered me until they decided to drop off the decorations on me. \n\nAnything else they wanted to keep was given to my nana (mums mum) to hold on to, but mum didn\u2019t want her Christmas decorations to be muddled with my nanas. Hence why she gave them to me ",
