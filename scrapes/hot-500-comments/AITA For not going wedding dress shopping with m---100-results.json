      "selftext": "\n\nSo I (33F) was supposed to go wedding dress shopping with my best friend (33F). The wedding dress expo was 3 hours away and she made accommodations for us to stay at her parents overnight so we could be there bright and early. We were going to turn it into a girls trip and do some shopping before meeting up with her step mom and sister to go look at dresses. On the day we were supposed to leave my child (6m) woke up with a rash and blisters covering his feet. I was getting him ready to go to the hospital when she texted me our departure time. I responded I was taking my son to the hospital. she asked why and I told her what was going on. We got to the hospital at 11:30 in the morning. There was no one in the waiting room so I assumed we would be quick. Unfortunately, that wasn\u2019t the case we didn\u2019t leave till 5:30 PM during the time we were there, I texted her frequently to kind of update her as to what was going on. But she never responded. I went home made dinner for my son and we settled in on the couch for snuggle since he wasn\u2019t feeling good. She ended up messaging me at 8:30 at night going off on me. Saying I\u2019m a bad friend that I could\u2019ve gotten my mom to take my son to the hospital. She also said she knew I was going to flake and that I\u2019m a bad friend and I was using my son as an excuse and I was pathetic. \nI do feel bad that I couldn\u2019t go with her, but my son takes priority as I am a single parent. Am I the asshole for not getting my mom to take my son to the hospital and going shopping with her? ",
