      "selftext": "My mom (66F) has never liked my paternal grandmother (93F). She complained about her bitterly throughout my childhood and basically refuses to see her these days except for once maybe every 5 years or so. \n\nI (30F) personally have a difficult relationship with my mom. She has never been very kind to me and I have a hard time being around her. \n\nMy husband and I have a great relationship with my grandmother and spent much of our twenties visiting her. We built our life together with a lot of inspiration my grandmother and visit her as often as we can. We often say we fell in love while out on our visits to my grandmother\u2019s house. \n\nMy husband never met my maternal grandmother as she passed before we met, though they would have loved each other. \n\nI am now pregnant with my first child and we\u2019re planning to name her after our paternal grandmothers. First name would be after my grandmother, middle name after his grandmother. \n\nI\u2019m fully expecting my mother to absolutely loose her mind over this. However, my grandmother has been very important to my husband and I and my mother has been quite cruel to me throughout my life. While I\u2019d like to avoid drama, the importance of naming my daughter after someone really important to me (also the first great-grandchild in the family) is currently outweighing the expected BS from my mom. My father has also suggested naming my daughter something else to avoid drama (we have not said anything to my mother about names yet). \n\nSo, WIBTA for naming my daughter after my grandmother? \n\n\n",

We did the same with our firstborn - even though I have the same issues with my Mother as you do and she was threatening a tantrum - but, we went with a \" derivative\"  of each grandmothers name and they were names 2 and 3.  So daughter had a \" Name\"  for herself, then grandmothers took 2nd & 3rd place in naming, with the names being \" derived from\" instead of actual names.  So to illustrate  with other names -   Rene & Lucy became Renee Lucille if that makes sense ?    \n  \nMommy needs to get a quiet talking to, about how her treatment of you all of your life has given you zero desire to be naming your firstborn after her, as she has made you feel \" x\"  \"y\"  \"z\"   (you stipulate the issues ) over the years, and even now as a married woman and at 30 years of age, she has not relented on her nastiness against you.  On top of that, she has been nasty about Grandmother as far back as you can remember, and has zero relationship with her, whereas you and husband DO have a relationship with her.\n\nThen go on to say \" Grandmother\"  on the other hand has been happy to see both Husband and myself, spending significant time with us- and is extremely important to us both.  We are choosing to acknowledge the names of our grandmothers in this case, as homage to being such important parts of our lives.  (I would be interested to know what sort of relationship Mommy-Dearest has with her own mother - and if that is as toxic as her relationship with \"beloved Grandmother\" and whether she'll throw her mother's name in the mix as \" blah blah you didn't choose MY side of the family\").   \n\nI would go on to say that her behaviour at this point will determine whether you're going to be even remotely comfortable about your daughter being as close to her as you have been to your grandmother, so unless she pulls her head in and stops with the viciousness and poison barbs -  if necessary you will see to it that there will be no opportunity for Mommy-Dearest to take her prejudice of GreadGrandmother out on the child.  \n\nA possible \"solution\" if you wanted to be diplomatic, is give Darling Daughter (newborn) a 3rd name that is an amalgamation of Hubby's Mom's name and your Mom's name..  That way it's not an exact copy, but, it gives her nothing to whinge about..  \n\nGood Luck.. Remember, this is YOUR baby.  Nobody chooses the names but Husband and You and the rest can go pound sand..",
