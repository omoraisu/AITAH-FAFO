      "selftext": "Hello,\n\nI had a small group of women friends whom I was pregnant with a few years ago. We bonded and we're excited to welcome our babies around the same time. It came time for me to have mine and in the first few months, I felt very judged by one of my friends. She told me she was concerned about my baby's health, sleeping, weight and eating. My baby was by the books perfect and met every milestone and gained weight exactly as all babies should. After holding onto this judgement for several months, I began to notice other instances where this friend talked negatively about every other mom in her life. I started to build up some anxiety and pain and with the help of another friend, confronted my friend with a letter explaining the hurt id endured early on in my mom journey. I told her I still want to be friends but a conversation was too painful and I just want an apology and a promise not to judge me as a mother.\nShe didn't respond and I haven't seen her since. I moved on.\n\nAnother friend of mine still remained pretty close but in the last year, I've been distancing myself from her for many reasons. The main ones being she speaks negatively about her husband in front of others (and in front of him) making people feel uncomfortable, she doesn't ask how I am doing (or anyone else) and will talk about herself, her work, and her child no stop, and she doesn't put much effort into friendships. She also is very type A (nothing wrong with that) but she thinks her opinions are the greatest and everyone should do as she is doing. Similarly to the other friend, i had a lightbulb moment where I realized she talks negatively about people in her life and gives others HUGE expectations but does little to show up for anyone else. The last straw was when I unintentionally exposed her and her family to COVID (I tested positive after we hung out, but negative the day before bc I had a sore throat) and after a profuse apology where I think I said I'm sorry a thousand times, she still gave me grief for days. I decided I only wanted to put in the effort I was getting back so I did the bare minimum in the friendship and lol and behold, she isn't speaking to me either.\n\nI know maybe communication could have been better on my part and I could have tried to bring issues up to people. However, my personality is that I love and am fiercely defensive of my friends and try to understand where they are coming from, even when they show negative attributes. But, once a switch turns on for me, and I see who they really are or see certain patterns, I can't go back. \n\nI have a lot of strong friendships in my life, friends I've had for decades and I make new friends easily. I've also had fleeting friendships that come and go (with jobs, relationships, etc) but these 2 are really bugging me.\n\nAITA for not putting up with negativity in friendships? ",
