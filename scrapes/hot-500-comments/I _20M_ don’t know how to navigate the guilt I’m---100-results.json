      "selftext": "\nI (20M) had been in an off-and-on relationship for about 4 years with a girl from my hometown, we\u2019ll call her C (19F).\n\nAfter we graduated high school in 23 we broke up, with the intention of it being a permanent thing. During the summer after graduation I had started seeing a different girl also from my hometown about 2 months later, we\u2019ll call her P (19F). The dynamic between P and I was strange, it wasn\u2019t sexual or romantic in nature, it was almost like we were just friends that had a crush on eachother and didn\u2019t know what to do.\n\nOnce I left for college that fall P and I lost contact with eachother. C and I ended up reconnecting like 3 or 4 months later, and eventually got back together.\n\nDuring the time that C and I were back together (about a year), I never heard the end of the fact that I had hung out with P over that summer. Despite the fact that I hadn\u2019t spoken to P once during my relationship with C, It felt as if I was constantly expected to feel some sort of guilt for my past with her.\n\nQuestions like \u201cif we break up are you just gonna hang out with her again?\u201d Became a pretty common point of discussion with C, and eventually due to other things going on in my life I couldn\u2019t cope with the stress that was being in this relationship, and we ended up breaking up.\n\nFast forward about a month and a half to right now, and I had been enjoying single life, and working on myself. I had no intention of reconnecting with P, however we ended up running into eachother at a party when we were both back in our hometown, and we have since been talking quite a bit. One night when we were with a group of friends she tried making a move on me, which I declined because I have been feeling some guilt about the fact her and I have reconnected.\n\nShould I feel guilty about this?\n\nWas it healthy for C to ask me on many occasions about my intentions in the case that we broke up?\n\nHow do I maneuver this guilt, because I think that I will encounter it no matter who I am with?\n\nTL:DR\nI was in a relationship where I was constantly asked if I would get with a specific other person in the instance we broke up, we\u2019ve since broken up and me and the specific other person have regained contact and I don\u2019t know how to handle the guilt I\u2019m experiencing\n\n\n",
