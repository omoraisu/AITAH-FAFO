      "selftext": "I've asked her multiple times to please not share information about me\n(excluding sick) to my family. She has broke this boundary many times. \nI sent her texts in a gc with my partner to feel more safe since she dismisses me and I was hoping with my partner in the chat she'd listen.\nI'm tired of going to chat gpt to help me make an\nemotionally mature text to send her for her to not improve and I blew up.\n\nSince I cant include screen shots, heres copy and paste of the texts:\n\nMe: Mom stop telling my fucking buisness to abuelo. He tells abuela everything and now all the family knows. STOP. They\u2019re all asking me about the wedding\nHer: What business \nMe: To you it may be just a wedding but to me I have NOTHING private NOTHING\nHer: ok\nMe: Please just please stop telling them where I go. I want privacy. I dont want to share that with them\nHer: ok\nMe: Jesus fuck I cant talk to anyone in the family. Bc all of yall constantly make me feel violated by telling everyone any and everything about me. I get if im sick but where im going, i just want ONE THING ANYTHING private to me, ANYWAY. like -name- told you(-name- assistant) that he has zero fucking privacy and its the reason the he if ores his family now or whatever. Bc in going to do that when I move out. If it doesnt stop bc it makes me feel crazy. Ive told yall multiple times. And I\u2019m never listened to so the family is getting completely cut off when I move out if they continue that crap bc I need to be treated like a human not a show dog. Think of me as overrating all you want but take a moment to try to see from my shoes. I know you meant no harm and were excited or just want something to talk about but why not ask me first at the least???? But then even if I say no youll prob srill tell him anyway bc this family has 40+ yrs history of not respecting others \u201cno\u201d\nHer: Sorry I just got excited cause I love weddings and receptions \nMe: Ik I\u2019m being over sensitive to things these last few days but ppl reach breaking points. Was me talking to you about it not enough. It makes me feel so uncomfortable bc then abuela and everyone gives their two whatever the wuote is. Or abuela will make me feel uncomfortable about it. It makes me feel deeply uncomfortable that they all get to know EVERYTHING about me EVERYTHING. Plus I dont even get a chance to tell ppl shit like you stole that opportunity from me if I DID want to share stuff.\nHer: Ok -my name-\nMe: I dont go around saying everything you do that day. I just lie to them and say work no matter what bc its not my place. Yall get mad at ME for calling yall out.\nHer: I don\u2019t care if you tell them about me \nMe: Well I care and I told u why\nHer: I know now \n\nHer now in private chat to me: I understand but your texts are coming off as\nabusively silencing me which trigger me because -ex husband name- did that to me\nMe: -face palm emoji-  -my partners name- said theres nothing abusive about it\nHer: I FEEL IT IS\nABUSIVE AND I HAVE THR RIGHT TO FEEL THAT WAY\nMY FEELINGS MATTER ALSO\nNOT JUST YOURS\nI understand what you are saying\nMe: I FEEL\nDEHUMANIZED\nBY YOU AND YOU NEVER LISTEN OR EVEN APOLOGIZE OR TAKE ACOUNTABILITY. ^ Thats me copying your energy\nher: I did apologize\n\ud83d\udea8Me: You dont truly understand why im hurt donyou? \nHer: I understand\nMe: Then explain to me why im upset\nHer: I understand and apologized.\nStop treating me like I'm 5 years old\nI feel like I'm constantly your whipping boy\nYou treat me like shit\nI'm always walking on eggshells around you\nMe: What in the projecting\nHer: -my name- im done\nMe: If you really\nunderstand then explain to me why\nIM upset\nYou cant\nAnd thats bc you dont care and dont listen. You not being able to explain why in upset proves that\nBc then youd realize \"my daughter is really hurt and trying to ask for help\"\nHer: You wanted that moment to tell them where you went if you in fact wanted to share that information w them\nI am also very hurt -my name- and have been\nBut I don't matter to anyone\nMe: This isnt about you right now\nAnd no thats bot why im upset\nHer: It you need help then ask me and l'll help anyway I can but I feel like you push me away\nMe: Be you try to force things on me\nHer: You don't want them in your business\nMe: And when I ask for help you play victim. Its exhausting And drainingn\nHer: -my name- its always about you\nMe: No shit\nBc if I have a problem, the problem is about me\nJesus you're narcissistic and I wish youd just listen\n-1 Reply-\nJust listen\n\ud83d\udea8Her: Give me an example   [of when she plays victim]\nI feel that way about you.   [to me calling her narcissist]\nYou blame me for everything horrible under the Sun\nI feel like my\ndaughter hates me and it seriously the worst feeling in the world to feel that\nIn your eyes I never do anything right and never have\nMe: You told me I made u feel humiliated and such about when I told you if you can change the subject when you were talking about\n-step brother- family \nwhen I accidentally brought him up.\nWhen I was feeling scared with really bad chest pain, you ASKED ME why l felt scared, and you cut me off when l was not even a full sentence in to tell me how god forbid everything isnt about me and what a victim you are.\nWhen ever ive tried to tell you when I hurt and you immediately\ndismiss me call me selfish and all the like then play victim and call me abusive for getting upset.\nHer: Try talking to me like you talk to someone you like and are friends with because you talk to me like I'm a villain\nMe: I get mad at you bc you rarely listen then play victim when youre the one who pulls emotionally\nabusive things on me\nIts the weirdest fucking thing ever\nI talk to u \"like youre a villain\" bc you dont listen and dont understand\nHer: I feel you shut me up and love to do it with an audience like -my partners name-\nMe: Ive told you this since middle school\nHer: Well maybe we should go to counseling\ntogether to resolve our issues\nBecause I want us to have a good relationship but we aren't seeing eye to eye\n\nEdit: I\u2019ve watched videos about covert narcissists and cried bc it sounds just like her. I know when she brought up her therapy, this it isn\u2019t serious because last time she called the therapist a narcissist and immediately pulled me out of therapy.\n\nEdit 2: maybe we\u2019re both the ah since I will share with her about my day or plans even though she has consistently disrespected my boundaries. I mean that is my fault.. I can\u2019t do the same thing and expect different results. At the same time she is also the ah for rarely respecting boundaries and not being emotionally intelligent or available.",
