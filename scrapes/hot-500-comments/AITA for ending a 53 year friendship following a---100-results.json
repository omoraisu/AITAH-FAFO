      "selftext": "Recently I went on a cruise with my bf of 53 years, her husband and a friend of hers from work. My bf and her friend work in healthcare. \n\nI\u2019m handicapped with COPD and back problems  and need wheelchair assistance to and from the plane. \n\nThey traveled to Miami on one airline and I flew to Fort Lauderdale on another, less expensive, airline but we flew out of the same airport. My flight left earlier than theirs. \n\nI drove us all to the airport and we went in together. They all traveled with backpacks and I had a carry on and a bag to check in that had a folding walker in it. I got no help from them with my luggage to the airline desk and they stood outside of the line to wait for me to check in before they left for their flight, not helping me to the wheelchair assistance desk that was on the way their concourse even though they could see how much pain I was in. \n\nMy flight arrived in Florida before theirs and an Uber took me straight to the pier. I waited about two hours for them to arrive at the pier. My bf found me sitting at a picnic table and motioned for me to follow her. \n\nShe, again, did not help me with my luggage. When I got to the entry point of the cruise those three went ahead to check in without helping me get to the wheelchair assistance area. The pain in my back was so intense it set off an asthma attack and I found a pole and slid down it to sit on the ground until someone came to help me. \n\nWhen I finally got checked in and wheeled onto the ship they were waiting for me right inside the entrance. Then we had to go find our muster station. They did not help me with my luggage at this time either.  After we got muster instructions my bf and her friend took the luggage to the stateroom and picked up our room keys. Instead of coming straight back to the muster station to get her husband and I, they took a tour of the ship and got their free drinks before bringing us our room keys. They did not bring my walker from my luggage for me to use. My bf had insisted that I not rent a mobility scooter for the cruise. \n\nI finally got to our room to get my walker and they wanted to get something to eat so we went to a burger place from a well known chef. My bf asked me how much I liked my burger and I said it was okay. She then whispered to her husband \u201cwe\u2019re not taking her on another cruise\u201d because I did not agree with her that it was the best burger I ever had. \n\nThey insisted that I be on the Lido Deck during departure from port. It started raining and they left to go inside without waiting for me. I had gone under a shaded area and sat down on a lounge bed waiting for the storm to pass. \n\nIt was a 7 night cruise. Every morning they all left to get breakfast without waking me up. I would be dressed and reading on my bed when they returned but before they even got into the room I could  hear my bestie say with a sneer that I wasn\u2019t even up yet. Her husband would be the first in the room and told her that I was awake and dressed. \n\nWhen she was planning the cruise I told her that I would be on the interior of the ship most of the time because my lungs don\u2019t react well to heat or humidity. I also take medication that warns me to stay out of direct sunlight. She was not happy that I would not go ashore when it was in the 90s and humid. \n\nAfter the cruise when her friend and I were headed back to her hometown (again using different airlines at differing airports) she and her husband stayed in Florida to take another cruise with their children/grandchildren the next day. \n\nI was going to their house to dogsit her male husky (and additionally, unplanned, her daughter\u2019s female husky \u2026 the sister to the male \u2026 that was in heat. Neither of the dogs was fixed). I had to keep them separated. \nThey knew I was unable to chase their dog if he jumped the fence. He did just that when their daughter\u2019s boyfriend brought over some doggy diapers when the male husky was outside. I did not notice that he was out of the yard until they phoned and told me that he was at the animal shelter.  I told them I\u2019d go get him but they had someone else do that. Then they called and told me I could leave because that person was going to take care of the dogs since I apparently couldn\u2019t be trusted to do so. \n\nThat\u2019s the last time they spoke to me. Three days after they got home from their second cruise I had not heard from them so I put a status on Facebook why I was ending the friendship (I did not use their names) and told them to have a good life.  A week later I blocked and unfriended them and friends I made through them and most of their family members. \n\nAITA?",
