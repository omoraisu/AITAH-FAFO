      "selftext": "A couple of months ago, I matched with Ana on Bumble. I thought we vibed really well, she had a really nice and funny demeanour and we had lots of engaging conversations on FaceTime.\n\nWe set up our first dinner date last week. I proposed a really nice restaurant which was sort of far from where we lived, but I really wanted to treat Ana because I thought she was special. Ana asked if I could pick her up and then after the date drop her off at her best friend\u2019s place. I didn\u2019t mind it all. Ana said she had movie night with her best friend.\n\nI picked Ana up and we went to the restaurant. The date went better than expected, we vibed really well. Ana also had drinks since I was the designated driver. However, right at the end of the date, Ana asked if I would drop her off at Josh\u2019s. I was initially confused and then realised Josh was her guy best friend. \n\nAna instantly realised what she said and it sort of became awkward. Ana apologised and I told Ana there was no reason to apologise. I was just curious about who Josh was so I asked Ana, and Ana said he was her guy best friend, and they occasionally have movie nights. Ana said she wanted to be honest with me because she really liked me and saw a future with me, and she admitted they sometimes make out during these movie nights but it doesn\u2019t go further than that. \n\nI appreciated Ana\u2019s honesty, but this whole thing felt like a huge gut punch. I was maybe in my feelings but I just couldn\u2019t do it anymore. I told Ana to just ask Josh to pick her up, and I paid for my portion of the dinner and left. Ana looked really sad when I ended the date and left.\n\nI felt sort of guilty about it later and called my sister to ask her if I what I had done was right. My sister said I shouldn\u2019t have left Ana stranded at the restaurant, especially after Ana was really sweet and honest with me. I told my sister how I could be expected to take Ana for a really fancy dinner, and then drop off her at her guy best friend\u2019s house, where she would then make out with him. I had enough self respect left not to do that.\n\nWas I the AH?",

She would go to dates with other guys but in the end all it needed was a message of that AH for her to go running back to his place thinking that way he would fall in love with her too. It was years ago and shes still embarrassed by all the stupid and dumb things she did and how she acted back then",

I made a mistake when I first made my account. \n\nI let Reddit pick the randomly generated username when I first created my account. I remember seeing that I had the option to come back later to change it and I meant to do exactly that. Then i made a post over in one of the crystal/mineral communities talking about Yellowcake (uranium) that I received as part of a larger collection. \n\nThat post blew up and I got a lot of like and comments and Karma from that one post alone. I remember going to change my username finally after that and I no longer had the option lmao. \n\nIdk if I either took too long or if because my post got so much attention and traction that Reddit could no longer allow me to change it because so many comments were already replying referencing my username on that post. \n\nAlas. I am now and forever Staffvegatable(random numbers) hahaha. \n\nI also tend to write really really really long comments and posts because brain damage caused from almost dying and then being in a coma for almost 2 weeks in 2019. \n\nIt makes me insecure about myself not making sense to people when I\u2019m trying to explain something. So I write entire novels basically just to say the most simple things lol. \n\nI don\u2019t mean to do it and so many people on Reddit get so mad when they have to read more than a paragraph haha. I\u2019m just terrified if I don\u2019t carefully explain myself I will sound dumb and not make much sense (clear example is what I\u2019m doing right now by over explaining myself lmao) \n\nSo my username combined with they extremely long texts probably immediately makes peoples automatically assume that I\u2019m a bot haha. I always hope they see my probably many spelling mistakes and how old my profile is, so they can see I\u2019m not a bot haha.",

I remember seeing that I had the option to come back later to change it and I meant to do exactly that. Then i made a post over in one of the crystal/mineral communities talking about Yellowcake (uranium) that I received as part of a larger collection. </p>\n\n<p>That post blew up and I got a lot of like and comments and Karma from that one post alone. I remember going to change my username finally after that and I no longer had the option lmao. </p>\n\n<p>Idk if I either took too long or if because my post got so much attention and traction that Reddit could no longer allow me to change it because so many comments were already replying referencing my username on that post. </p>\n\n<p>Alas. I am now and forever Staffvegatable(random numbers) hahaha. </p>\n\n<p>I also tend to write really really really long comments and posts because brain damage caused from almost dying and then being in a coma for almost 2 weeks in 2019. </p>\n\n<p>It makes me insecure about myself not making sense to people when I\u2019m trying to explain something. So I write entire novels basically just to say the most simple things lol. </p>\n\n<p>I don\u2019t mean to do it and so many people on Reddit get so mad when they have to read more than a paragraph haha. I\u2019m just terrified if I don\u2019t carefully explain myself I will sound dumb and not make much sense (clear example is what I\u2019m doing right now by over explaining myself lmao) </p>\n\n<p>So my username combined with they extremely long texts probably immediately makes peoples automatically assume that I\u2019m a bot haha. I always hope they see my probably many spelling mistakes and how old my profile is, so they can see I\u2019m not a bot haha.</p>\n</div>",
