      "selftext": "Coming here for some advice. I have a friend, let's call her Betty, that is married to a guy, let's call him Jim.  Betty and Jim are married and like many, they hit some rough patches during and after covid. About a year or two ago Betty started spending a lot of time with a male friend, Carlos. So much so, that it almost felt like they were dating. Carlos would hold Betty's hand, put his arm around, and always tough her - like if they sit next to each other his leg or hand is always on her. When I asked what that was all about, she laughed it off and said he was just a really good friend that she would tell him to cool it. \n\nThis weirdness continued and about 3 months later she proceeds to tell me that her relationship with Carlos is not physical, just emotional and that she's in a QRP. And I was quickly informed that it was not a throupple. Betty said Jim was supportive of it, but I have my doubts. Jim is a really nice guy and wouldn't want to lose Betty. Betty has a history of taking on \"projects\". In many ways it is great - because she helps people during difficult times when they have no one else, like divorces and job losses. So, I figured Carlos was just another project. Betty gets very defensive when I point that out.  \n\nWhen I talked to Jim about it, he said he was cool with Carlos. But I see Jim bristle when the guy is in the room.\n\nSo, Betty, Carlos, and I are working on a show together and now I have to watch this behavior up close. I've noticed it doesn't happen when Jim is around, but I do see it in front of her kids and other people - LOTS of other people.\n\nAITA if I tell her again to stop with the PDA if she's still married to someone else? Maybe I am too traditional, but this feels shady and makes me feel gross whenever I have to watch Betty and Carlos cavort like a bunch of teenagers in school. ",
