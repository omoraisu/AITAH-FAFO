      "selftext": "I always give to the less fortunate around the holidays and I specifically take a tag from the local \u201cgiving tree\u201d. This means I buy 4-5 gifts for a local child and the requests are on a tag I take. I usually like to help an older teen, since I feel they have more expensive needs and I want them to have a good holiday. In years past there is usually a mix of clothes and gift cards and I spend between $150-200. This year I took a tag for a 15 year old. When I got home, I realized all the requests were very expensive high end, brand name items. Beats headphones, Nike football gloves, Adidas sneakers, other expensive requests and gift cards. I bought everything except the sneakers, since I already spent over $250 and the sneakers requested were another $150 at least. I feel like if the teen needed sneakers, just say that and I would buy a nice set. Same for the headphones and other items. Why do they have to be expensive brand name items? Maybe one really important brand name item to the teen but not everything over $100. So AITAH for setting a limit and not buying the high cost sneakers the teen requested?",

You can take one for a jacket, one for a bag or socks, one for a toy truck or just one to a hat.\n\nI do not do those things, anyhow.  I have two local organisations that feed poor, unemployed and homeless people.  I give them money every Christmas and at other times if the priest assigns me one of the Good Works of Mercy as a penance.  If I get a windfall over one hundred dollars from the lottery or gambling or something like that, I give twenty per-cent of it to one of these organisations.  I give a toy to Toys-for-Tots every Christmas.  The local hockey team also has a programme where at one game, if you give a toy, they give you a hat or something.  Girlfriend likes those.  \n\nThe sponsors need to work on that tree.\n\nNTAH",
