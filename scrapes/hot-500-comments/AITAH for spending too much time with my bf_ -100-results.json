      "selftext": "I\u2019ve been with my boyfriend for about a year and my family (except dad, will elaborate) has been nice to him but I know they don\u2019t truly accept us being together because of his lower class, something that makes me so sad because he makes me so happy but they can\u2019t look past that. My dad: a few days ago marked the second time he ever spoke to my bf. Anytime my bf and him were in the same place he would completely ignore him to the point where he would turn his chair to face away from my bf. \n\nMy family is also very traditional and old school, they think premarital sex is super wrong and go to extreme lengths to prevent it. When I had my first bf at 15 I was never allowed to go to his house even when his mom would invite me, I wasn\u2019t allowed to be picked up by him, any time we wanted to go somewhere he would drive and my mom would drop me off and pick me up, in my house we were only allowed to be in public areas and they would check on us every few minutes. Even with all this, I still lost my virginity to him because we would always find ways. That experience made me never want to have a bf again, and I managed to wait until 19 to have my next bf. \n\nBy this time many other rules that my parents had set, I was already breaking, so I stopped caring and i do go in his car and to his house. I have never directly told my family that I go over to his house, but I\u2019m sure they can guess. My grandma also lives with us and she thinks the same, she has asked me in occasion if I go to his room or if we\u2019re ever home alone. Of course I go to his room and of course we\u2019re home alone but I get so nervous when it comes to those issues that I always deny. \nHis family is the opposite of mine, they all got married and had kids young, and they think that sex is just a part of life that\u2019s natural and normal. They don\u2019t care what me and my bf do and we mostly spend our time in bed watching movies. At my house, we can only be in public spaces and even then we wouldn\u2019t be able to cuddle while watching tv or show any pda. For all these reasons, I spend all my time at his place and am barely ever home. We probably spend at least 6 hours a day together, when he\u2019s off work we spend around 18 hours together. \n\nMy parents have never allowed me to sleepover anywhere, even now they allow me to go on weekend trips with my friends out of town, but still won\u2019t let me sleepover at their houses. This means I wake up, go over to my boyfriends house, and come home after midnight, sometimes until 2 am. This is something that has bothered my parents a lot, because they allow me to go out to the club until late but they don\u2019t think I should be with my bf until that late. Since I\u2019m not home all day I barely see my own family but when I do all they do is tell me that I\u2019m never home, that I never see them, that they\u2019re mad bc I was out too late, and today I\u2019m writing because my grandma woke up and I was already awake using the bathroom and wearing tennis shoes because I was going to feed the dogs, and she started confronting me that I had just gotten home. Although I\u2019ve been tempted, I would never sleepover at my bfs house because of the fear I have towards my family\u2019s judgment and anger. And then she tells me what she tells me often: \u201cdo you think it\u2019s right for you to spend all day and all night over there?\u201d Personally, I don\u2019t see anything wrong with me spending all day with my bf, but I say that and she tells me that I am wrong. It\u2019s already uncomfortable for my bf to come to my house knowing how my parents really feel about him, but then these things happen and I wanna be home even less, and my bf wants to come over even less. \n\nSo I just wanna know, am I really wrong? This is who I want to spend the rest of my life with, if my parents weren\u2019t the way they were I would\u2019ve already moved out with him. It\u2019s funny because they don\u2019t think unmarried ppl should live together but I know if I were to say we\u2019re getting married they would never allow it until I\u2019m older. I just wonder because when we get married and live together, it\u2019s going to be normal for us to spend all our time together, so why is it wrong for us to spend all our time together now? I also wish they saw how it affects me when they tell me this stuff. It makes me really not want to be home at all, which is ironic bc they\u2019re getting mad that I\u2019m already not home but they\u2019re just pushing me away more. ",
