      "selftext": "My family is colombian so it's super normal for us to live with our parents at an old age. I (29F) just started seeing a new guy and have been staying over a couple of times, lying to my mom where I've been so she doesn't ask weird questions. Yesterday I stayed over and told the truth, but today when I got back home my mom didn't want to talk to me and was so angry. I really don't see the problem, but I don't know if I'm missing something. Is it that bad for a grown up to have a little freedom?",
