      "selftext": "We have a few big chain salons where I am from, I normally go to the cosmetology school (it's cheaper) but this time it wasn't an option and when to one of the big chains. I have a short hairstyle and the side and back are buzzed. So I went there for a classic cut they did good to my knowledge at the time and I paid $20 plus $10 in tip then I left. Okay side note I don't have a car or a way to get around, I don't feel safe taking the busses especially with my 4 yr old. So it's been about 10 days now and I go back in and i start nicely telling the lady that \"I got my hair cut there 10 days ago and there was 1 spot I found after my shower that was longer, and due to not having a car I couldn't get there any earlier and could they fix it\" she looked me up and said it's past there 5 day window and I'd have to pay another $20 bucks. So i looked at her and said \"you want me to pay another $20 bucks to sit in the chair for 5 minutes and get a 2 second buzz with the razor?\" She said that was the rules so I asked to talk to the manger and told them and they didn't help either. I'm sorry guys I can not imagine or justify spending $20 dollars on a 5 minute service. So am I the AH",

The manager can only do so much as well, it\u2019s sad this has happened to you, but no one is the asshole in this situation. I recommend to just go to the cosmetology schools service from now on whenever you can. I understand you\u2019re in a tough situation with transportation but the salon holds no fault in that.
