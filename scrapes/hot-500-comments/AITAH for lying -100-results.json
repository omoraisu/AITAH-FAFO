      "selftext": "So basically, long story short I lied to my friend (which I totally own up to and know it was wrong and have apologized). There was this guy my friend was into in the friend group, originally it was just a crush and then it turned into an obsession that pretty much collapsed the friend group. There were multiple factors that led to all of us telling them not to get together but then they did and lied to us all about it. We were pretty hurt but it felt like we bounced back from it pretty well as friends. A month ago, I was struggling with a lot of substance abuse problems due to financial, academic, and familial stress. One night, I was very high and began contemplating if I had a problem or not (I did) but reached out to the guy my friend had a crush on because he too had/has a smoking problem. I began talking to him and asking if he thought I had a problem or not. He began to tell me that he didn't think I did, and about how amazing and beautiful he thought I was and essentially flirting with me. In my intoxicated and lonely state, I reciprocated the flirting and asked him to sleep with me (no pictures or anything was exchanged) I fell asleep and woke up the next morning flabbergasted by what I did. Immediately I texted him and told him I didn't mean any of it, that I was high and that I did not like him I was just lonely and he said all the right things. He texted back saying not to worry that he understood and that he was also high and didn't mean any of what he said. I did not and do not have any romantic or physical attraction to this guy at all, I was just greening out severely. I did not tell my friends because 1) I was embarrassed of my smoking habits and did not want to be seen as weak 2) I cleared it up immediately 3) I did not think it was a big deal because nothing at all happened. However, apparently this guy lied to my friends and told her I was sober and asked to hu on multiple occasions (I did not). She held it in for three weeks before confronting me about it with my other best friend at 1 am after I got home from work. This is where I know I'm the asshole, because I did lie and did say I didn't ask to hook up. There's no excuse for me lying, however I do want to emphasize that I was extremely exhausted from a long shift in retail, studying for finals, and trying to find time for my friends that day while also still fighting the urge to smoke until my brain felt like comfortable mush. They caught me in the lie and were rightfully upset and left, which I do not fault them for at all. However, later that night all of my other friends in the friend group began blocking me without warning. I am the type of person that needs to write down their feeling and journal to make sense of them all. So, I had written apology letters I planned to give to my best friends in the morning after the dust had settled. However, I opted to put them by their door that night because I did not want them to turn me into a social pariah without knowing my side of the story. This morning, I woke up to a knock on my door from someone they had sent to collect any item they had in my room (including a behavior chart that we made that I paid for the posterboard to make). I've tried to text them to ask to talk so I can explain that I didn't mean to hurt anyone and apologize for lying. However, no one is responding or even reading my messages. I think it's important to note that when the friend who was lying about hooking up with the male friend I high texted, my other friend and I were only upset for a few days and then we talked to her about it and everything was cleared up. We did not take our stuff from her room, we did not turn off our locations for her, and we did not pit the rest of the friend group against her and block her. However, they've done all this to me. I know I'm in the wrong for lying, however seeing as I cleared up and recounted my high texts with the boy and it did not lead to anything I didn't think it was a big deal and kept it to myself because I felt it would be blown out of proportion as it is now. What do I do? Am I really a terrible person for this? ",
