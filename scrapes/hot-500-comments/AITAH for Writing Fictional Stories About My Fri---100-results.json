      "selftext": "So, I (26F) love to write. Ever since I was a kid, storytelling has been my favorite creative outlet. Recently, I started posting on Reddit, mostly on subs like AITA or relationship advice. My posts have been getting a lot of attention, which feels amazing, but here\u2019s the thing: the stories I post are fictional. They\u2019re inspired by the people in my life, but they\u2019re not real.\n\nFor example, if my sister (28F) is late to lunch, I might write a post about a fictional sibling who keeps flaking on plans. Or if my mom forgets to call me back, I might create a story about a parent who doesn\u2019t prioritize their kids. The characters are loosely based on real people, but I change all the details to make them unrecognizable. To me, it\u2019s just a way to exercise my creativity while engaging with a community that loves stories as much as I do.\n\nI never thought it was a big deal\u2014after all, they\u2019re just stories, and I didn\u2019t think anyone would take them personally. But last week, my best friend (27F) somehow stumbled upon one of my posts and recognized that the \u201cinspiration\u201d came from her, even though the events were entirely fictional. She got really upset and said I was being disrespectful by using our friendship as material for public stories, even if I wasn\u2019t naming names.\n\nShe told a couple of other friends, and now things have spiraled. My sister is upset, saying it feels like I\u2019m writing about her behind her back, even though I\u2019ve never revealed anything personal or real. My mom says she feels like I\u2019m \u201cputting words in her mouth.\u201d Some of my friends think it\u2019s inappropriate to use them as inspiration, even in a fictional context.\n\nI never meant to hurt anyone. I genuinely thought of this as harmless fun\u2014just a way to work on my writing and connect with people online. I didn\u2019t think anyone in my life would ever see these stories, let alone feel hurt by them. I feel awful, but at the same time, I\u2019m struggling to understand if what I did was really wrong.\n\nAITAH for turning bits of my life into fictional stories for Reddit, or are my friends and family overreacting?",

You're not the AH for something like bad parents and flakey people in general, very relatable common things, but if a friend can stumble across a post and instantly recognise it even with names and places changed, then it's not loosely based anymore and you are writing about them which can be hurtful and embarrassing for them so you would be the AH for that one.\nIn future consider making more changes to very specific situations to avoid hurting people you love",
