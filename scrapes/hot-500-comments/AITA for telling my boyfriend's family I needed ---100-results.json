      "selftext": "Hi Reddit, I (25F) have been with my boyfriend (26M) for about three years. I\u2019m really into crafting and love reusing things most people would throw away, like empty bottles or soda tabs. Over time, my boyfriend\u2019s family started saving things for me, like old cans or random scraps, and honestly, I thought it was super sweet. I\u2019ve always appreciated that they thought of me.\n\nBut here\u2019s where things got kind of... weird. My birthday is super close to my boyfriend\u2019s sister\u2019s (28F), like only five days apart, so we had a joint birthday party last year. As gifts, they gave me a bag full of \u201ccraft supplies,\u201d like soda tabs, empty bottles, and some random other bits and bobs. I mean, it was thoughtful in a way, but then his sister got these super nice gifts, like a pandora charm bracelet and an apple watch. I felt a little embarrassed to be honest, but I kept smiling and thanked them because I really do appreciate gifts in general. My boyfriend noticed, though, and he got really upset\u2014he even wanted to call them out, but I told him to let it go and not cause drama.\n\nThen last christmas happened. A few days before, I\u2019d hurt my wrists at the gym (nothing major, just a scrape and some bandages), but I hadn\u2019t told his family about it since I hadn\u2019t seen them. Only my family and my boyfriend knew what actually happened.\n\nSo christmas morning comes, and we\u2019re all opening presents together. His family gave everyone else these *amazing* gifts\u2014new shoes, jewelry, an iphone, gift cards worth like hundreds of dollars. When I opened mine, I got\u2026 an empty soda bottle, some used (and dirty) aluminum foil, and a handful of soda tabs. That was it.\n\nLook, I\u2019m all about crafting, but this felt kinda insulting. My boyfriend was fuming, but we decided to keep quiet for now. Then his family asked me, all smiling, \u201cdo you like your gifts?\u201d\n\nI just\u2026 snapped. I smiled back and said, \u201coh thank you so much! I really appreciate it. But unfortunately, I won\u2019t be able to use them anymore because of my accident.\u201d They looked confused, so I explained (very seriously) that my injury was worse than it looked and that both my hands would have to be amputated. My boyfriend nodded with a straight face and added that we hadn\u2019t told anyone yet because it was a really emotional situation for me.\n\nTheir faces went WHITE. They started apologizing, saying they had no idea and how awful they felt. A few of them even looked like they might cry. I just nodded and said, \u201cIt\u2019s okay, I\u2019m used to it by now,\u201d and left it at that. We left shortly after.\n\nHere\u2019s the thing\u2014my hands are totally fine. It was just a couple of scrapes, but I was so hurt and angry about the \u201cgifts\u201d that I wanted them to realize how thoughtless they were being. My boyfriend thinks I was justified, but later his sister texted me saying I was cruel for \u201cmaking a scene\u201d and guilt tripping the whole family on xmas (ig the word got to her that my hands are fine).\n\nSo now I\u2019m starting to feel a little bad. Did I go too far? AITA?",

It would have been better to call them out straight away; perhaps it wouldn't have been drama, but if there had been, at least it would have been taken care of before the Christmas event while building resentment and putting the appearance that the \"gifts\" of trash were acceptable.\n\nThe family sucks, don't get me wrong. The trash is far from a gift. It's cute, I guess, just as a random day. \"Hey, we got some more of this stuff. Do you want it?\" And have it be clean, for pity's sake. But as an actual gift, it's unacceptable.\n\nMy aunt and my grandma loved to craft when they were alive and able to. But if we got them anything \"crafty\" it was nice supplies, not things from the recycling. We knew what sort of crafting they were doing at the time and tried to make sure we had appropriate items to go along with their workings. The alternative, like someone said, is a gift card to a store they like. I LOVE gift cards.

We decided to get all of our friends together at our house for a housewarming party. We asked that everyone bring us an ornament for our tree (it was Christmas time) as our housewarming gift. \n\nIt was awesome. We got some amazing ornaments. We got some people\u2019s own from their childhood, we got homemade ones, Gag ones (a stuffed gingerbread man with a dick and balls that looks like candies, and when you squeeze him he says very inappropriate things. It\u2019s the tits.), some were from our favorite movies, or other things people know we liked.  We had everyone write their names somewhere on their ornament. \n\nThe best part is, every year when we put up our tree, we get to reminisce, laugh about all of our dope ass ornaments, and remember friends we have seen in a while. My favorite one is a cardboard cutout Christmas tree that\u2019s about 6x4 inches tall.  It\u2019s covered in macaroni and rigatoni, spray painted silver, and covered in glitter.  This thing is rock solid - it\u2019s lasted this long and hasn\u2019t lost a single piece of macaroni. \n\nEveryone always notices it and compliments my kids for doing such a nice job. I love getting to correct them and telling them that actually, my 27 year old friend made it for me as a gift\u2026so thank you, we think it\u2019s wonderful too.",

I&#39;m very lucky that my boyfriends parents give me gifts like family, but we&#39;ve been dating for four years. The first year of birthday/Christmas was smaller, but I really appreciate them giving me anything. It&#39;s not a requirement or something I expect. My own parents haven&#39;t given me much for Christmas/Birthday since I was 20, which is fine too, I&#39;m an adult. OP sounds very immature and entitled.</p>\n</div>",

We all know she could get those things herself from her own place. The fact that they gifted her that EVERY SINGLE time is upsetting, thoughtless, and disrespectful. Tell me, do you gift people the same things at every opportunity for 3 yrs straight? If you do, I promise you, the receiver is tired of you.</p>\n</div>",
