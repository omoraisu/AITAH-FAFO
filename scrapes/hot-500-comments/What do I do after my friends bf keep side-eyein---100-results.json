      "selftext": "Me (17f), my three friends (17f), and my friends bf (16m) were sitting at a train station after my friend\u2019s bf (we\u2019ll call her A) got herself a small iced coffee. A\u2019s bf proceeds to drink her entire cup without her realizing. Mind you, she used the last of her paycheck to pay for it and didn\u2019t have extra money. So, reasonably, she was pissed. She didn\u2019t yell or anything, just a little whiny and complained. My other two friends and I were clearly on the same page because it was unfair. It\u2019s also worth to mention that none of us like A\u2019s bf and he was two hours late because he was \u201cwith the boys\u201d. After she started complaining, he fully looked at me and side-eyed her. He looked at me although he was saying \u201cthis bitch needs to stfu\u201d. I looked at him in disgust. Cause wdym you think I\u2019m on your side?? Anyway, do I tell A? I\u2019m also hesitant because they were fighting and then they were talking for a good hour and a half. Is it even worth mentioning?",
