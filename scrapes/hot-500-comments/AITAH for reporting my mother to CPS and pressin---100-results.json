      "selftext": "I 18(F) graduated Highschool last year. I have a good job now as a CNA. I graduated highschool early at age 17! I was living with my mother until this situation yesterday. I am now staying with my real dad until I am able to move in to my new apartment. The apartment isn\u2019t available until December 21st of 2024.\n\nI have four siblings who are 15, 13, 11, and 9. My mother married my stepfather then I was 1. My younger siblings are from her and her stepfathers relationship. My mother is a neglectful mom. She allows her husband to mistreat me. Her husband has hit me, spat on me, shoved me, and stolen from me time and time again. \n\nThe rules in the house are that I pay 400 a month in rent, for a small bedroom. I have to buy and eat my own food, I have to pay the internet bill, which is 100$. Even though I PAY RENT, I am not allowed to lock my doors, I\u2019m not allowed to lock the door in the bathroom, I\u2019m not allowed to use the internet after 6 pm, EVEN THOUGH ITS IN MY NAME, and I pay the bill. I\u2019ve been respecting their rules. Recently I bought a new computer, I am containing my studies. I am starting school for medication aide. When I finish school I\u2019ll have a medication aide certification, on top of the CNA liscense I have, after medication aide courses are complete for me, I am going to take phlebotomy. The laptop I bought was 350$, and that was because it was on sale! \n\nYesterday my stepfather demanded more money from me after I paid all the bills required of me! He is a drunk, he has a drinking problem and my mother enables him. They neglect the kids they have. They always go out to eat, drink, and my mother always has her nails and hair done but \u201cdoesn\u2019t have the money\u201d to take care of her kids. As a result I\u2019ve been taking care of them. I told him that I wasn\u2019t giving him anymore money! \n\nThis was early yesterday morning. I went to work and came back later in the day. I went into my room and noticed my door was open, and my room got trashed. My laptop was gone. I asked my siblings if they had seen my laptop. They said no. I went upstairs and asked my mother if she\u2019d seen it. She said, \u201cWell (stepdads name) sold it to the pawn shop because he needed money for household expenses.\u201d\n\nAt this point I was livid because I needed that laptop for school. I said, \u201cI paid all of my required expenses for the house. He had no right to take that laptop that I had.\u201d Basically she said that it\u2019s their house their rules, and that if I didn\u2019t like it I could leave. I called my father, and asked him if I could stay with him until December 21st. My dad, being the rockstar he is, let me stay with him. He\u2019s not charging me rent or utilities! \n\nEarly in the morning today. I went down to the magistrate to press charges. I reported him to the police for his past violent behavior, and for the theft. I blocked my mother and stepfather on everything! I reported my mother and stepfather to CPS for neglect and to report a dangerous environment! A few hours after, my mother called my dad furious, she said, \u201cShe reported my husband for simply needing money. The police came to our house and arrested him\u201d The area I live in my country, they take theft or any crime for that matter, very seriously. I\u2019m surprised they arrested him so fast! I\u2019m wondering if CPS is as quick. \n\nAlso for clarity: My mother was stupid enough to admit his crimes through text messages. I showed the police and magistrate the messages. \n\nAITAH? I feel bad for my siblings, I don\u2019t want them to go to foster care, but at the same time they live in a dangerous environment! \n\n",

I hope the police get your laptop back from the pawn shop as it was stolen property or get you your mum and stepdad to reimburse you/replace laptop at full retail price. You did a good thing calling CPS to protect your siblings, hopefully your mum and stepdad will get the mental health treatment they obviously need and this give them the kick up the arse to know what they were doing was wrong and accept the help and change so they can make a safe, happy, healthy loving home for you and your siblings. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re safe. </p>\n\n<p><strong>Please Change your passwords for all your accounts; SM, shopping, banking etc redirect all post especially banking to a new PO Box or dads address, change address and next of kin details everywhere including medical, insurance to just your dad as next of kin and remove your mum name and details.</strong></p>\n\n<p>If possible cancel internet provider and let them know you were in an abusive home and financially abused and coerced into getting the contract- as financial abuse is now spoken about and acknowledged more as a form of abuse some companies will wave the early end of contract fee or freeze it and restart internet when you move to your new home. If they send threats send it to the police and see if you can get a protective order for them to stop harassing you or getting others to call and harass you. </p>\n\n<p>Please don\u2019t let them know your new address when you move and don\u2019t tell anyone that you know might tell them after a sob story and some tears from your mum. If friends/family she knows don\u2019t understand or say some \u201cyou\u2019re family\u201d- \u201cshe\u2019s your mother\u201d rubbish or you went too far/overreacted etc they shouldn\u2019t know where you live or any information you don\u2019t want your mum to know. </p>\n\n<p>Stay bring as amazing as you are. Wishing you all the best in your future. Good luck!</p>\n</div>",
