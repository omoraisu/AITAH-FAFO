      "selftext": "I had been considering moving out of my apartment for a couple months now, but ultimately decided not to.\nThe reason I wanted to move out is because my roommate drinks and becomes obnoxious and loud and is overall annoying to be around. We have lived together for years now and my patience is gone. it is almost to the point where I do not want to care at all. but I still do because we have helped each other out over the years and I know that he cannot afford to live alone.\n\nwe are about to sign a 6 month lease renewal, but after that, would I be the AH for leaving.",
