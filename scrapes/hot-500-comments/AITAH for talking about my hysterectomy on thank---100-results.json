      "selftext": "a month ago i made a post about my husband constantly asking to get me pregnant even though i have a hysterectomy scheduled (which has now been pushed back to march and I'm pissed cuz the pain and bleeding is getting worse.) and how i blew up at him about everything but mostly him caring more about his \"manhood\" than making sure I don't get pregnant again and die. i asked him to get snipped when i was pregnant and a couple times after and he said he would do it and then never did. we both agreed to no more kids after i got pregnant with our 17 month old.\n\nso my husband and i kinda reconciled, he moved back in right before thanksgiving. but on thanksgiving my mother in law started asking if i was pregnant cuz she had a dream someone had twins and i was the only one who she could think of. my husband kept telling her i wasn't but she kept insisting so i told her i wasn't since i was currently bleeding to death and i hope she didn't expect anymore kids from me cuz I'm getting everything removed soon. her flabber was gasted that i would even talk about it so openly...we weren't eating or anything we were just sitting around watching the kids play on bikes and scooters.\n\nshe didn't talk to me the rest of the day either. my husband said she was just upset that i wasn't gonna have anymore kids...\n\nAITAH for talking about it?",

I was bedbound from pain for 2 years and now I work, I hike, I play with my kids and not having periods ever again or having to worry about babies sneaking in there is such a relief.
