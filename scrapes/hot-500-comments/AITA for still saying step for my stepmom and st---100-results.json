      "selftext": "My brother (18m) and I (16f) have a blended family. Our mom died when we were little and our dad married our stepmom when we were 5 and 7. We have three stepsiblings (15f, 14m and 12m) and two half siblings. My brother and I are the only ones who say stepmom and stepsibling or half sibling. My stepsiblings say mom and dad for our parents and they call us their brother and sister. They also don't like to mention the half part for our younger siblings.\n\nI always used it and so has my brother. My brother doesn't have much said to him, but I do. It wasn't always true but for the last year-ish, since it was around Christmas last year this first came up, it's been an issue that I don't say mom/sibling without step before them. I asked my stepmom why it bothers her after all this time when I always had a good relationship with her and always said stepmom. She said it's the fact I don't remember my mom but I have her in a higher spot even without that relationship being present. That she understands it from my brother because he remembers mom a little bit. She said she knows we have mom's family and she loves that for us, but she wanted to hear me call her mom. She had hoped I'd want to be adopted before now and I have never shown any interest in that. She said she figured my siblings would all be full siblings. She blames my mom's family for spending time with my brother and me and never including our step and half siblings. She said if they had treated us all the same it might be different.\n\nDad told me after I talked to my stepmom that my stepmom and stepsiblings feelings are hurt. My half siblings don't care. They seem to get it better because it was always how it was for them and they hear half as a term used among some of their friends. But he said my stepsiblings feel abandoned and it's not so much about me and my brother but that it doesn't help them either. They don't have their bio dad in their life or his family and dad's family aren't a big part of our lives because they didn't want to treat my stepsiblings the same. Then my brother and I have mom's family and they never get a look in with them. He said everyone had hoped it would become more of a united family unit. He said he was a little disappointed it didn't happen for me that my stepmom became 'mom' over time and my stepsiblings would become just siblings.\n\nMy stepsiblings told me a few times they don't see me and my brother different than they see each other. That we're all equal siblings and they feel equally close to all of us. I guess I don't. I love them but my brother is the sibling I'm closest  to and we have a bond I don't have with my other siblings, step or half. \n\nMy stepmom got mad at me a couple of days ago because she found this old school project I did with a family tree and she said it sucked to be on the side of the three and to see her kids on the side, and my parents taking priority even mom who I don't remember. She said it's hard to be a stepmom who stays a stepmom even when the kid doesn't remember and can never have a relationship with the \"birth mom\". She said it's worse to think I love her but not that much.\n\nAITA?",
