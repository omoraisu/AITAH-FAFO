      "selftext": "I (34M) am child-free and have been my entire life. I\u2019ve always loved hobbies like building LEGO sets, collecting action figures, and even some light gaming. Over the years, I\u2019ve turned one of the rooms in my house into a \"toy room,\" which is essentially my personal space filled with collectibles, intricate LEGO models, and a few rare items I\u2019ve spent a lot of time and money acquiring.\n\nMy sister (38F) has three kids: 9F, 7M, and 5M. She\u2019s always known I\u2019m into this stuff and never seemed to care until recently when her family came over for a visit. Her youngest son (5M) saw the room while I was showing my brother-in-law around the house and immediately got excited. He asked if he could go in and play.\n\nI gently told him that the room wasn\u2019t for playing, and I\u2019d be happy to set up some toys he could use in the living room instead. This didn\u2019t go over well with my sister. She said I was being ridiculous and that I should let the kids \"be kids\" and enjoy themselves. I stood firm and explained that many of the items in that room were fragile, expensive, or had sentimental value.\n\nHer kids were disappointed, and she accused me of being \"selfish\" and \"not understanding how to be part of a family.\" She\u2019s since brought it up multiple times, saying I\u2019m \"hoarding toys from actual children\" and making her feel unwelcome.\n\nTo be clear, I love my niece and nephews. I\u2019ve always gotten them gifts for their birthdays and played with them when they visit. But I see my collection as more of a hobby or an art display than something for kids to handle. It\u2019s not like I have a house full of toys and I\u2019m refusing to share\u2014it\u2019s one dedicated room that I\u2019ve spent years building up.\n\nMy parents are split on the issue. My mom thinks I could\u2019ve \"compromised\" by supervising the kids in the room, but my dad sides with me, saying it\u2019s my house and my rules. My sister\u2019s still upset, and now I\u2019m starting to wonder if I overreacted.\n\nSo, AITA for not letting my sister\u2019s kids play in my toy room?\n\n",

You didn't say, \"Nope, kids aren't allowed to play in my home.\" You said that your collection room wasn't a child friendly place and suggested an alternative. \n\nI had an ex who called my Nightmare Before Christmas collection childish and asked if he could gift my plush toys to his daughter since I'd \"obviously outgrown the need for toys.\" He didn't respect that it was a collection and not just a random accumulation of toys. \n\nMaybe calling it something other than the \"toy room\" would convey to your family that it isn't a child friendly space. If your gaming set up is in the same room as your Lego collection, you could call it your gaming or computer room. Take away the association from the word \"toy\"?\n\nMy brother does the Lego botanical sets, and they aren't cheap. Does your sister understand that one of those \"toys\" can run over 200$? You could always say that you'll let the kids play in there, but she needs to buy you NEW replacements if anything gets broken. Let her find out just how much of an expense went into that room the hard way.",

Or, be extra and install one of those combination keypad locks on the door. If it\u2019s a whole basement situation with no available door, you can put up child gates. Attach several (hundred!) jingle bells on the gate so you can hear it when one of the older kids or the adults try to go past your security measures. They will.

I just do it in creative ways. The kids feel respected and they understand why they're not supposed to do the thing they're being told not to do. Lots of parents want to seem like they're doing some progressive teaching method but don't apply it properly. I've seen people who also refuse to say no to the kids but they miss some of the important steps and you see these kids walking all over the parents. \n\nOne example was a kid being wild at a children's museum. Throwing paper around near people, being reckless and way too loud. Idk if they had to go home or what but the kid starts having a major tantrum. Crying and just being annoying. I'm all for letting kids express themselves but the mom decides to coddle him and try to talk to him and eventually he walks away but still very upset and sensitive. His older brother tried to talk to him or console him and right away the younger kid (who was about 7 or 8) starts throwing a tantrum again. The mom scolds the older brother for not being aware of the younger brothers feelings.  Instead of leaving the area and letting the kid cool off somewhere away from there the kid again is being loud and annoying. The whole time the mom is explaining things to her son and etc but she lets him get away with his tantrum and they just keep playing. \n\nI use similar style parenting where I won't just repeat myself over and over again saying stop and no. What I would have done different is if my kids start throwing a major tantrum  or simply not behaving I atleast walk away from the public so they don't have to be disturbed. I give them a chance to behave and there's levels to it all. Sometimes it's one no. Sometimes it's a few and then we are leaving it there's consequences. The kid understands that bad behavior means playing stops or else there's a consequence. Sitting there and saying no a hundred times and being the \"don't say no\" parent are the same thing if your kid gets to keep playing if they don't listen.",

Kid was a spoiled piece of shit and a classic jock. Every other day he'd get called down to the lobby to pick up a fast food lunch his homemaker mommy brought him, which he'd make sure to rub in every one's faces by eating annoyingly loudly.

Which really fucked with a lot of us that depended on our phones for different things. Like the kid with diabetes that originally got told he'd need to find some way to completely change his insulin pump system because he couldn't use the controller for it anymore because it was an app on his phone.

Whip that out to mom and ask which item she is willing to cover for the kiddo to play with.)</p>\n</div>",

And the shelf in our spare room, I custom made and lit, to hold the little Lego sets my wonderful partner has bought me over the years. </p>\n\n<p>It makes me incredibly happy to see those little things lit up, the work it took in making them, and the care with which she got them for me; and I get to see that, every time I look at it, in the house and life we built together. </p>\n\n<p>Sure sounds selfish, don&#39;t it, wonder why I wouldn&#39;t want it trashed by someone who didn&#39;t know better, when their parent really should....</p>\n</div>",

In any case, over the years I have accumulated several Disney collectibles that are now worth a lot of money and that you can no longer find around except on ebay at exorbitant prices, I also have some comics that I have accumulated over the course of 18 years and over the years I have also gone to flea markets to look for hidden gems to enrich my collection, even finding comics that date back to the beginning of the last century. Every time I came home, I found these precious toys out of place, one of them even broken, so I told my sister that I was not happy with this at all and that it was still my room and that she had no right to let her children come in and touch my stuff when I'm not there. This thing happened several times and so in the end, to avoid arguing, I decided to put everything in boxes and no longer give my nephews access to that room when I'm not there. I also obviously adore my nephews and I shower them with gifts and attention even if I live far away. This year, for example, I'm giving them a double Christmas present to all 4 of them, so I don't think I'm being unfair just because I'm very jealous of my stuff.

I think you should buy them some cool little Lego sets or maybe cheaper versions of some of the figurines (like superhero figurines for kids) and the next time they come over show them what you got for them to play with and tell them \u201cthe stuff in my special room isn\u2019t for playing with, but I got these especially for you guys to play with & I\u2019d love to share it with you and play with you guys.\u201d \n\nNot only will this give the kids fun things to do at your house, it\u2019s also great bonding since you like legos & figurines and can play it with them too. It\u2019ll also probably get them into liking the same sort of things which means they will start to value them as they get older as well. Kids will definitely find it weird you have all those \u201ctoys\u201d that they can\u2019t play with & they probably felt really uncomfortable that their question led to an argument between you & their mom. And they may even be on the mom\u2019s side of it since they don\u2019t understand. So this kind of breaks that uncomfortableness they may have next time they come over too. And if they get into Lego then maybe you could buy them the cooler mid-range sets as they get a bit bigger. It could be something you guys really enjoy together. \n\nAnd while you\u2019re playing I\u2019d also try and explain why the toys in your room are not for playing with & different than toys to play with. Ask them if there\u2019s anything they have that\u2019s really special to them that they wouldn\u2019t want other kids touching in case they broke it.
