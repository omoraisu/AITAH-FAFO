      "selftext": "My (23F) birthday is a few days before Christmas, and in my family we\u2019ve made it a point to make the two events\u2026 two separate events. I\u2019ve always had my own little celebration on my birthday, and then we have a Christmas celebration on the holiday. I know it\u2019s a bit childish, but in these last few years I\u2019ve become a mother and my birthday became a pretty important event for me; it\u2019s a day I get to actually focus on myself and do something *I* want. \n\nThis year there\u2019s been some animosity amongst the family, due to some \u2018drama\u2019 that happened a while back between myself and another family member. We already squashed that issue, but a lot of the family still treats me very differently from the entire situation; I was told by one that the other family member had given a wildly inaccurate story of what had happened, but at this point I\u2019m not even interested in defending myself to them. If they want to believe something bad about me, I\u2019m letting them. \n\nAnd for that reason, alongside the fact I\u2019m going to be having another baby in February and will have to focus my attention on a newborn again, I\u2019ve been planning on leaving town for my birthday. I usually have a \u2018family party\u2019 where we all have dinner together, but I\u2019d already been wanting to go out of town for a while and my birthday was the perfect excuse to. My husband went to his work and got a couple of days off so we could leave town without worry, and I started getting really excited about it! \n\nWell yesterday my grandma, who has Christmas at her house every year, called me to tell me that the family was planning on celebrating the holiday a few days before it this year\u2026 On my birthday. I asked why that was the plan, and was told it was because my cousin, who is also pregnant and due about five months after me, can\u2019t make it to Christmas if it\u2019s on the actual day. I mentioned that we\u2019d never moved Christmas to my birthday before, and that I wasn\u2019t even sure how it would work? We don\u2019t usually get done with our holiday activities till around 8PM on a normal Christmas, so when would we even do anything for me.? She got upset and told me that plenty of people have their birthdays on holidays, and that it will be fine. I then told her I\u2019d already made plans with my husband for my birthday and I wasn\u2019t very keen on cancelling them, and she got very upset before hanging up. \n\nI didn\u2019t think I was in the wrong yesterday, I\u2019d already made plans for that day and they moved Christmas without checking if I did. But then I woke up this morning to messages from a few of my cousins getting upset with me for it, and now I\u2019m questioning myself. My husband says it was crappy for the family to do what they did and that we should have fun on that day, but I don\u2019t know. ",
