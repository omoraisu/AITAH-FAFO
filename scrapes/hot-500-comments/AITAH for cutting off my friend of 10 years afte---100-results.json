      "selftext": "AITAH for cutting off my friend of 10 years after she didn\u2019t show up for a planned weekend together?\n\n(warning yes this is a post by a teenager with teenage shit problems so if you don't care about this content please don't read and don't call me names THANK YOU. And sorry for any mistakes my English is average so I'm using a translator)\n\nI\u2019ve known \"Ashley\" for 10 years, and we used to support each other. Last year, she was in a toxic relationship with her ex (also my friend at the time). He cheated on her, blamed her, and they kept reconnecting despite the toxicity. I cut him off after he called me a liar about being molested by his friend's father. Ashley ignored his behavior.\n\nLater, her ex tried to run me over while I was walking with Ashley. When I confronted him, he sent hateful messages, which led to a breakdown where I almost harmed myself. My friends intervened, but Ashley, despite living nearby, didn\u2019t show up.\n\nRecently, Ashley moved schools, found new friends, and became distant. She often talked about her ex or praised her new friend, \"Della,\" who is wealthy and does things with Ashley that I\u2019d suggested before but was always declined.\n\nThe last straw was a planned weekend where Ashley was supposed to stay over. After over a month of planning, she canceled the day before, saying she\u2019d only drop by briefly to give me a gift. I got upset, and we argued. Now we\u2019re not speaking, and I wonder if I overreacted.\n\n",

So it's ok to grow apart and let people go when you start to realize they fall into the first or second group.
