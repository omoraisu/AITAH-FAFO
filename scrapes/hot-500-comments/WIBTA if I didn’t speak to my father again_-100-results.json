      "selftext": "To add context, politics is involved in this, but it is not the main factor. Please excuse grammar mistakes, I am not a talented writer. \n\nAll of this context was based on what both parents told me, what their friends noticed, and what I\u2019ve deduced myself. \n\n     My father (48) is not my biological father, my mother(45)  and he were not in a committed relationship when she got pregnant. My mother was upfront with not knowing who the father was when she initially got pregnant. He made it clear this did not bother him. He knew I (21) was not biologically his since I was about five or six. Both of my parents had very rough childhoods. My father grew up in the Philippines during a war and was the child of a mistress. After my maternal grandmother died, my mother began getting abused by her father. I say this because I want everyone to know the background of our family dynamic. \n\n     They got divorced when I was nine because my father didn\u2019t want to have more children while my mom was studying to become a professor. My dad made a good amount of money, as an established engineer. At this time my mother was a public school bus driver. My mom did not want my father to feel taken advantage of, so she never requested child support. She had primary custody, which is what they had both agreed to. Despite this, she still struggled to put food on the table. My mother scarcely asked my father for money, and he would rarely lend her money for necessities she could barely afford herself. \n\n     When I was in high school, like all teenagers I began to prioritize my friends over my family. I called my father less and less, enthralling myself with kids my age. After about a year of trying to adapt to my independence, he completely cut me out when I was a sophomore in high school. I was completely inconsolable for months, calling my father daily, and his friends to try to convince him to talk to me. After a while, I gave up completely. I went through all of high school, quarantine, and my graduation without my father. Still, one of his friends told me, my father wanted me to keep trying to reach out. \nI developed resentment towards my dad for this. Three years of reaching out, I felt as if I was supposed to perform for him. Like I was supposed to fight for my father, even harder than before. I completely checked out. This time last year, I decided to try one last time. It didn\u2019t take much effort for him to be excited to hear from me. His voice sounded sad but satisfied. He told me something about taking accountability for my actions, saying he felt discarded. I groveled an appropriate amount, and that seemed to satisfy him.\n\n      He soon asked me to come over for a few days, so that we could reconnect. The first thing he told me was that he hoped I was not a liberal. The first thing he told me was not that he missed me, or asked how my high school graduation was. He told me he hoped I was not a liberal. I knew at that moment, this reconciliation was not going to last. Even if I agreed with his political beliefs, this would be an alarming moment.  While we were separated, he converted to Catholicism and became rather obsessed with guns. While I was there, I observed that his guns were not secured. One sat in a bag on the living room floor where my three-year-old sister messed around often. I told him this worried me, and he insisted she \u201cknew better\u201d. Yeah right.\n\n      While we were separated I also realized I was transgender (FTM/NB) and I at least wanted to tell him that. When I subtly brought up transgender people he exploded into a spiel, obsessing over the genitals of athletes he assumed to be transgender. All I decided to tell him was that I was attracted to women. He shrugged this off, as long as I wasn\u2019t bisexual. He then exploded into another spiel on polyamorous people, insisting all bisexual people were cheaters. Something starkly different to how he treated his bisexual friend when we last spoke. It was like his eyes glazed over,  every time he saw an opportunity to discuss politics. I told him what real research said, and he would huff, insisting that he was right and that he didn\u2019t care what the science said. \n\n     The entire week I was there was exhausting, we only bonded over shallow things like television shows I recommended he should watch. Even my stepmother, who barely knew me, could tell I was holding something inside. The only good thing over the entire week was meeting my sister, who will likely never remember me. After I got home, I just deflated. It was like the understanding father I knew my whole life was warped into someone excited to hurt other people. He said very racist things about Chinese, Black, and Hispanic people while I was there, which was less surprising to me. After all, none of his Chinese, Black, or Hispanic friends were in his physical photo albums anymore. He also forgets my biological father is black, so I imagine he considers me \u201cone of the good ones\u201d.\n     \n     I tried to understand his politics over the phone multiple times, and the one time I corrected something false he said, he blew up at me. I hung up, he was someone who taught me not to tolerate the language he threw at me. He texted me, demanding I pick up, and said I had better not hang up on him again. I told him he was being cruel, and I hoped he understood that one day. He said he didn\u2019t need me in his life, and I\u2019d better apologize if I wanted to stay in his life. The very next day, he apologized and agreed he was cruel. I told him I was transgender over text, and told him I didn\u2019t need him if he was going to threaten to cut me off over every little thing.\n      \n     Sometimes I would send him music or show recommendations, and vice versa, but that was the extent of our relationship. After the 2024 election, I messaged him something of substance. I told him I hoped he would get what he wanted out of a trump presidency because I knew for a fact I wouldn\u2019t. I told him I hoped it would be worth our relationship. He insisted we could be close regardless of politics, and I taught him that. I don\u2019t see a relationship where we only discuss movies to be one of substance, nor to be one worth salvaging, so I did not respond. I blocked his number. I had to do so much emotional labor for him, and he didn\u2019t add anything to my life, since I was fourteen. I love him, but I have no reason to fight for him other than nostalgia. I believe nostalgia isn\u2019t worth all the ways he drained me.\n\nWould I be the asshole if I did not speak to my father again?\nLet me know if you want more details.\n(Edit: Grammar and formatting)",
