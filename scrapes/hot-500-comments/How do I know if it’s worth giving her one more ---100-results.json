      "selftext": "I\u2019m at a crossroads in my life, and I don\u2019t know what to do. I\u2019ve been in a **6-year-long relationship** with someone I\u2019ve loved deeply, but I can\u2019t ignore how much it\u2019s been hurting me lately.\n\nMy partner (24F) has always been short-tempered, especially when I say \"no\" to something. Over the years, I\u2019ve adapted, made excuses, and convinced myself it\u2019s just a phase. But the past year has pushed me to my limits.\n\nWe transitioned into a long-distance relationship (LDR) as she\u2019s finishing her studies and I\u2019m working a demanding job. Despite my packed schedule, I\u2019ve been there for her, especially during her placement season. I stayed up late, helping her through the stress, even though I had my own challenges\u2014my job and exams.\n\nWhen she finally got placed, I playfully asked if she\u2019d introduce me to her parents. Her response shook me. She said I wasn\u2019t \u201cpresentable enough\u201d because I earn less and has fewer qualifications than her. She apologized later, but it stayed with me.\n\nThe next day, I went on a short trip\u2014a rare thing for me. She bombarded me with calls, accusing me of being unavailable and saying she was \u201cbetter off single.\u201d It hurt, but I let it slide because that\u2019s how it\u2019s always been.\n\nThen, something happened that broke me. I called her later that day to share devastating news about a serious medical condition one of my parents is facing. Instead of support, she lashed out\u2014abusing me while I was at my most vulnerable. That was it. I broke down.\n\nThe moment she realized I wasn\u2019t my usual \u201cchill guy\u201d self, she switched. She begged me not to leave, apologized profusely, and promised to change. But this isn\u2019t the first time. It\u2019s a pattern\u2014anger, guilt, promises, repeat.\n\nI\u2019m torn. I\u2019ve loved this woman unconditionally, but I\u2019m exhausted. Every part of me wants to believe she\u2019ll change, but how many more chances can I give without losing myself?\n\nShould I leave and prioritize my peace, or should I give her one last chance?\n\nEdit:\nAs many of you have pointed it out, it\u2019s high time to end this relationship. I will end it once I speak to her\n\n",

It\u2019s not a perfect relationship and we do have our issues, but the way in which we deal with them is so much healthier. I thought my ex was my soulmate and I\u2019d never be happy with anyone else.

She is abusing you and then playing up manipulating you. \nShe is looking down her nose at you  as she has told you that you wouldn't look good, introducing you to her father and putting you down about your employment and financial status. She has also judged you about your education and certification. For 2 people who are meant to love each other, it seems that you are giving trying and being patient with her, but she is taking advantage of your feelings for her and your good graces are being taken advantage of. She is not thinking as well of you as you are of her, unfortunately. I am sorry to hear how she has been treating you as it is very rude and unacceptable. You need to honestly sit down with her to discuss your relationship and to set some rules and boundaries, especially with the way she  talks down to you she judges you all while she manipulates you.  You need to express your concerns and feelings about how you feel when she gets nasty to you and also how she has expressed  her feelings about your work your education and the fact her father may not approve of you. It seems as though she has a lot of negative feelings about who you  are and  what you have achieved all while she  has her bad moods. These are all red flags of her being very narcissistic and manipulative and mean to push you away  for whatever reason?  You will need to ask her exactly why she gets so mean and aggressive to you, and what her true thoughts and feelings actually are towards you as you are hearing constant negative feelings and thoughts about what she thinks and feels about you your career and your educational degrees. Ask her also if she has mixed emotions and  if she has underlying negative emotions about your  relationship. She also may need to see a doctor who can discuss her mental and emotional health as she is showing signs of a mental health issue. But you have to be true to yourself and know if the relationship between you has been breaking down as you need to  be in a healthy relationship where you are  treated with dignity and respect also loved for who you are and the connection unfortunately your gf puts you down has aggressive outbursts then apologises as if it never means anything you need to make her accountable for her words and her actions for the many times she has  gotten aggressive then apologises which  \n I know you have said she apologises non stop but her actions aren't trying to prove that she is willing too do heaps to make it up to you and that she is truly wanting to make things work with you. Time for you to speak to her and take control of how she treats you and how you want your relationship. You won't put up with her angry abusive attacks on you as you don't do the same.\nYou need to ask her to take notice of how her mood is going because you would prefer that if she tried to do some calming and connection with you working on the problems that are obvious and need to change if the relationship is to move forward. You need to be treated with care and empathy plus love so you think that you would like her to show some care not just say it as her negative actions are out waying  her positive attitude.\nGood luck",
        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>She won&#39;t change. She is a toxic narcissistic personality. She is abusing you and then playing up manipulating you. \nShe is looking down her nose at you  as she has told you that you wouldn&#39;t look good, introducing you to her father and putting you down about your employment and financial status. She has also judged you about your education and certification. For 2 people who are meant to love each other, it seems that you are giving trying and being patient with her, but she is taking advantage of your feelings for her and your good graces are being taken advantage of. She is not thinking as well of you as you are of her, unfortunately. I am sorry to hear how she has been treating you as it is very rude and unacceptable. You need to honestly sit down with her to discuss your relationship and to set some rules and boundaries, especially with the way she  talks down to you she judges you all while she manipulates you.  You need to express your concerns and feelings about how you feel when she gets nasty to you and also how she has expressed  her feelings about your work your education and the fact her father may not approve of you. It seems as though she has a lot of negative feelings about who you  are and  what you have achieved all while she  has her bad moods. These are all red flags of her being very narcissistic and manipulative and mean to push you away  for whatever reason?  You will need to ask her exactly why she gets so mean and aggressive to you, and what her true thoughts and feelings actually are towards you as you are hearing constant negative feelings and thoughts about what she thinks and feels about you your career and your educational degrees. Ask her also if she has mixed emotions and  if she has underlying negative emotions about your  relationship. She also may need to see a doctor who can discuss her mental and emotional health as she is showing signs of a mental health issue.
