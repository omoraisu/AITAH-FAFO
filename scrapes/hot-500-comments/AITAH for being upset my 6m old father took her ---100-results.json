      "selftext": "\nI 21F am in a coparenting situation with my daughters father 22M. \n\nTo make a long story short, on thanksgiving her dad decided to back out on all our Christmas plans. We both agreed to be together for our daughters first holidays but clearly not as planned anymore. \n\nToday, her father took her to take pictures with Santa for her first time ever and didn\u2019t tell me. I actually didn\u2019t even get the photos from him, his sister sent me them. \n\nThis gutted me. I am truly so heart broken I didn\u2019t get to be there for my daughter \u201cmeeting\u201d Santa for the first time. On the other hand I feel stupid for being upset. I just felt like I was purposely excluded from this. \n\nWhen I asked her dad why I wasn\u2019t allowed to be involved in this, he told me to go get my own pictures done :/ and \u201che wasnt thinking about me or himself, just baby.\u201d \n\nMy point is, it isn\u2019t the pictures. It\u2019s the memories. I was left out of this. I keep being told I\u2019m acting bitter and selfish by him for feeling this way. Idk - I\u2019m just really sad about this! It\u2019s not a memory I can get back by getting new pictures done. \n\nAITAH for being upset my dads daughter took her to see Santa for the first time without me? ",
