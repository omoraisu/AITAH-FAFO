      "selftext": "Hi everyone, this whole situation has me confused and could use advice on what to do moving forward.\n\nI\u2019ve been at my current address for roughly two years, and most every weekend plus even on the weekdays sometimes my neighbors host wild loud parties with very loud music, drinking out in front of the house (I don\u2019t care but they leave beer cans and broken glass most of the time). Among other issues. On a lot of these occasions they\u2019ll actually have live bands come perform. \n\nThese are not big houses, it\u2019s a dense inner city Phoenix suburb with about 12 feet of space between the houses. Last night I\u2019d just sort of had it with the situation because my wife works at 5am and the music was so loud that it was buzzing my windows/ furniture and keeping her up. So around 10pm (10:04pm) I went and knocked on their door and tried to speak to them. The man next door immediately got extremely aggressive telling me to call the cops if I want to and know that he knows I\u2019m complaining he\u2019s going to start complaining too, whatever that means, told me to get the fuck off of his property, got in my face putting his hands in my face, just truly unhinged about it. I recorded audio of all of this from my pocket. \n\nI\u2019m wondering though- am I crazy? Like is it just not socially acceptable to ask your neighbors to be respectful of others in extreme circumstances like this? Should I not have knocked on their door? \n\nI\u2019m also really concerned about them retaliating and maybe like messing with our cars or breaking a window or just any sort of generally crazy response. Given these circumstances should I report them to the HOA? I don\u2019t know for sure but I can\u2019t imagine all of this doesn\u2019t violate the CCRs somehow. Even if it does, and even if the HOA contacts them will that just make it worse? I\u2019m lost and borderline concerned for our safety after this encounter. Thanks for reading ",
