      "selftext": "This has been the most traumatic year of my life, and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m being too harsh or if I\u2019m justified in my choices. I (F35) was married to my husband (M42) for eight years. We have two kids together a son (9) and a daughter (7). I thought our life was stable and happy until everything unraveled seven months ago.\n\nI found out that my husband was cheating on me with my younger sister (24). I didn\u2019t discover it through subtle clues or intuition. My son overheard an inappropriate conversation between the two of them at a family gathering and came to me, confused and upset. When I confronted my husband, he denied it at first, but eventually admitted to the affair.\n\nI was utterly shattered. But what made it even worse was that my mom sided with my husband and sister. She defended their actions, saying, \u201cYour sister is young and doesn\u2019t know any better,\u201d and, \u201cYour husband must have felt neglected to fall for someone else.\u201d Then she had the audacity to suggest I forgive them and \u201ckeep the family together for the kids.\u201d I was stunned and disgusted.\n\nMy dad, on the other hand, was furious. He called out my mom\u2019s behavior, told her she was enabling betrayal, and eventually filed for divorce from her because he couldn\u2019t tolerate her lack of morals. He\u2019s been one of my few sources of support throughout all of this.\n\nI filed for divorce immediately and cut off my mom and sister completely. My kids have been struggling with the fallout. My son is especially angry and has told me he doesn\u2019t want anything to do with his dad. My daughter is quieter but has been acting out in small ways. We\u2019ve been going to therapy together, and I\u2019ve been doing everything I can to help them navigate this while also trying to heal myself.\n\nOver the past few months, I\u2019ve started putting my life back together. I\u2019ve focused on my kids, leaned on my dad and close friends for support, and even started dating someone new (F36). She\u2019s been incredible\u2014kind, understanding, and supportive. She\u2019s great with my kids, and they\u2019ve grown to love her, which makes me feel like I can finally see a light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nBut the chaos isn\u2019t over. My sister\u2019s relationship with my ex-husband has completely fallen apart (shocking, right?). Now she\u2019s blaming my mom, saying she encouraged the whole thing. My mom, meanwhile, is blowing up my phone, accusing me of tearing the family apart by refusing to forgive them. She says my new relationship is \u201ca slap in the face\u201d to our family and claims I\u2019m being selfish for not letting her or my sister back into my life.\n\nTo top it off, my ex-husband has been reaching out, begging for forgiveness and asking for a second chance. He\u2019s telling me it was all a mistake and that he misses me and the kids. My son and daughter both want nothing to do with him, but I\u2019m conflicted about how much of a relationship (if any) they should have with their father.\n\nMy dad and friends say I\u2019m doing the right thing by cutting out toxic people and focusing on rebuilding my life. But the guilt-tripping from my mom and sister is starting to wear me down, and I\u2019m wondering if I\u2019m being too harsh. Should I try to reconcile with my mom and sister for the sake of family? Should I give my ex more of a chance to be involved for the sake of the kids?\n\nAITA for divorcing my husband, cutting off my mom and sister, and moving forward with my life and new relationship?\n\nedit: i have changed my number and i\u2019m currently moving, no i don\u2019t speak to any of my ex husband\u2019s family and apparently the snitch was my aunt and her husband (are we shocked?) so i\u2019m officially not speaking to them. And for the people complaining about the fact my kids know my girlfriend so what? my children adore her, also for the custody. It\u2019s 60-40, meaning i can choose which schedule the kids can have with their father since i\u2019m the primary. No i\u2019m not forcing my kids to not speak to their dad, they\u2019ve told me numerous times that they don\u2019t like going to my ex husband\u2019s house and i respect that, i\u2019m currently going for full custody. For the people telling me to get a restraining order, my lawyer said they haven\u2019t done anything to endanger my children and I so i legally can\u2019t get one. My dad also has some suspicions that my mom cheated on him with how she was defending the affair.",

            "body": "u/Clicklingpop My dear I am so sorry for what you are going through, a big hug. \nI am glad to hear that you and your children are in therapy, your children are smart, but they are still young. Even though many people will disagree with what I will write here. Your children need to grow up also with their father, this is necessary to prevent them from having any kind of resentment in the future towards him and also towards you.\n\nThe good thing about this is that your children already know what their father did and with the therapy your children are in, it will take some time for the hatred and anger towards their father to disappear and in time they will be able to get over it and move on with their lives. It is also beneficial for them because you are giving them the space they need which will help them clear their minds and heal, that is if you don\u2019t pressure them to have contact with their father for now. Your husband demands to see the children, but he doesn\u2019t understand that if your children are close to him, it would be bad because it could stress them out being close to their father. While your children are healing, take the opportunity to talk to your ex-husband and force him to sign a document in which he agrees not to pressure his children, to be a stable father to your children and to accept his responsibilities. When your children come of age, they will know if they want to stay in contact with their father. Their father will have to accept your decision since it was partly his fault.\n\nYou are doing the right thing in not having contact with your mother and sister, you are not obligated to maintain contact if you don\u2019t want to. But if you ever want to get close to your mother and sister, do so as long as you have talked to them about going to therapy and accepting the consequences of their actions. Mention to them that this will be the condition for you to have contact again, they should be stable women and not choose to betray you again. Do this as long as you decide you want to have contact with them, if you don\u2019t, don\u2019t. They will have to live with their decision and your sister knew perfectly well what she was doing, although it is notorious that she is unstable and has internal problems that led her to betray you, she must accept that maybe you will no longer have contact with them.\n\nBest wishes to you, you are a very strong mom and woman, continue to be the best mom to your children. They know how lucky they are to have you. Please cut contact also with that person who is giving information from you to you mother.

            "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p><a href=\"/u/Clicklingpop\">u/Clicklingpop</a> My dear I am so sorry for what you are going through, a big hug. \nI am glad to hear that you and your children are in therapy, your children are smart, but they are still young. Even though many people will disagree with what I will write here. Your children need to grow up also with their father, this is necessary to prevent them from having any kind of resentment in the future towards him and also towards you.</p>\n\n<p>The good thing about this is that your children already know what their father did and with the therapy your children are in, it will take some time for the hatred and anger towards their father to disappear and in time they will be able to get over it and move on with their lives. It is also beneficial for them because you are giving them the space they need which will help them clear their minds and heal, that is if you don\u2019t pressure them to have contact with their father for now. Your husband demands to see the children, but he doesn\u2019t understand that if your children are close to him, it would be bad because it could stress them out being close to their father. While your children are healing, take the opportunity to talk to your ex-husband and force him to sign a document in which he agrees not to pressure his children, to be a stable father to your children and to accept his responsibilities. When your children come of age, they will know if they want to stay in contact with their father. Their father will have to accept your decision since it was partly his fault.</p>\n\n<p>You are doing the right thing in not having contact with your mother and sister, you are not obligated to maintain contact if you don\u2019t want to. But if you ever want to get close to your mother and sister, do so as long as you have talked to them about going to therapy and accepting the consequences of their actions. Mention to them that this will be the condition for you to have contact again, they should be stable women and not choose to betray you again. Do this as long as you decide you want to have contact with them, if you don\u2019t, don\u2019t.
