      "selftext": "So here\u2019s some background: I (23, F) come from a family where my father is the sole earner. My father worked for the government and is now retired, and he has been funding almost everything for the family, including my older brother (34), who has been unemployed for his enitire life. My brother has made some really bad decisions in terms of his career and lifestyle, which have drained my father\u2019s retiremenet savings, and now my father is using his pension just to cover basic living expenses for my brother, his wife, and their kid, born recently. My brother hasn\u2019t contributed financially or emotionally, and my parents often feel let down by him.\n\nI\u2019m in my second year of an MBA, and the tuition fees were 21 lakhs. My father was happily ready to fund everything, but after observing all this and realizing that we're just one emergency away from getting into bad financial position, I took an 8-lakh loan to ease the burden on my father. It\u2019s been really difficult because I feel like I\u2019ve had to carry a lot of responsibility for myself, my education, and my family.\n\nI recently got an internship with BNY, which eventually turned into a full-time job at a low salary (8 LPA, against 11 average LPA in my college). The job is not intellectually stimulating, and I hate the work, but I took the offer because I was influenced by friends and bad job market. Now, I\u2019m stuck with this low salary, and I\u2019ll have to depend on my father for professional certifications like CFA/FRM to switch to better job/role/field, which cost a lot. I won't be able to fund it on my own due to low salary, loan EMI, etc. This would add to the financial burden on him, and I feel like his entire savings and pension are going toward funding my education and my brother\u2019s life, and it feels unfair.\n\nHere\u2019s the part where I feel conflicted: I resent my brother deeply. I feel like his decisions have made my life harder. If he had settled into a decent job years ago, my father wouldn\u2019t be in this financial bind. But now, at 34, my brother,(as well as his wife and the baby) is still dependent on my father, and I feel the pressure of having to make up for all the mistakes he\u2019s made. I feel like my brother is in this position because of his own choices\u2014he didn\u2019t make the right decisions, he didn\u2019t put in enough effort, and now my family and I have to deal with the consequences. I love my parents and would help them no matter what, but I would have much rather preferred it if i did it as a choice & not compulsion, I feel suffocated because I have to take on so much responsibility due to my brother\u2019s choices.\n\nEven though I may not have been perfect in everything I did, I\u2019ve always been able to do somewhat better than my peers. I could have done even better, but I know my own laziness and procrastination held me back. Still, I\u2019m in a position where I can sustain myself well, and I feel like I\u2019ve done better than my brother in that sense. I feel like I\u2019m expected to succeed in all areas of life\u2014professionally, financially, and emotionally\u2014just to make up for everything my brother hasn\u2019t done. This extra pressure weighs heavily on me because, had my brother done better for himself, I wouldn\u2019t have to shoulder so much. I did confront my brother about all this, and while I didn\u2019t scream or shout, there was evident, severe frustration in my tone. He got emotional, and I felt bad because I know he\u2019s had his struggles, but I also feel that he put himself in this situation and that he\u2019s had every chance to improve. I\u2019m left feeling like I have to do everything for the family, financially and emotionally, because my brother hasn\u2019t stepped up.\n\nSo, AITA for resenting my brother for his choices? Should I feel bad for being frustrated with him, or is my resentment justified?",
