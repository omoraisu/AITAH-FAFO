      "selftext": "I love my friend but they rely heavily, almost exclusively on gurus and snake oil salespeople to solve their problems which lends itself to making matters worse. Just listening to the stories of obvious cons, scams, ripoffs and highway robbery is exhausting. They interrupt when I'm trying to reason with them. Instead of talking about what I want to talk about or positive things they might want to talk about, a large portion of time is given to intervention in obvious scams. Whether it's healers, naturopathic doctors, psychics or whomever else can see them and their wallet coming, it's always someone who they're going to, giving money to, to fix their many issues. They refuse any conversational means of addressing their issues, which is their right, but is very hard to watch and listen to because I'm a very empathetic person. I feel like it's taking over our relationship. \n\nNot long ago, we went to an event and they behaved very selfishly, kind of like a child or teenager might, focused on having fun and taking pictures instead of helping out because we were in charge of our own setup. I spent a lot of money on this and all I asked was a small contribution of materials and a helping hand. I haven't seen them in months since the event and in the interim they have struggled with their health. Whenever we speak, the focus is on their health and emotional challenges and the negative impacts on their life from these challenges. I really sympathize an empathize with them. I want to help in whatever way I can. Standing idle while they get ripped off isn't my style and certainly not helping them or their situation. It's getting to the point where I don't want to talk because I know what's coming. Personally, I'm also dealing with a lot. Even my therapist says so. Trying to address issues with my friend always ends up being more than they can easily handle. They really don't want to hear what I have to say about these things but that tough love.\n\nI do feel like the only solution is to put a lot of distance between us so that I can function without taking on their problems. It's hard because they have multiple diagnoses on top of as yet undiagnosed issues with their physical health. I feel drained and frustrated just from interacting with them and with all of my trauma, health concerns and my new found functional stability in the balance, not to mention my emotional well-being.\n\nAITAH for keeping my distance? I love them, but I feel like they're dragging me down every time we talk.",
