        "body": "First time making a Reddit post but here goes.\n\n  \nSo my good friend from Tijuana had been having a hard time with a recent breakup and invited me (24 M) and a couple of guy friends from San Diego to come down to TJ and party at one of his neighbor's house for halloween. Little context, I was born and raised in Tijuana and have been moving back and forth between SD and TJ since 15-16 years old. Both of the friends who I crossed with to go to the party are also Mexican but were born in the U.S., barely speak spanish and seldom travel to TJ, if at all. \n\n  \nWe get to the party and start having a good time in our friend's neighbor's garage, my two friends are knocking it out of the park with some girls who barely speak english and I'm making friends with some of the other people at the party, all regular. At some point I notice a couple of guys approaching one of my friends and telling him a couple of things in spanish that sound like regular TJ banter, something like \"Ay man you fucked up?\" \"Yeaaaah he's fucked up huh?\". My friend wasn't more drunk than anyone else at the party and my suspicion is these guys were probably a bit jealous that this girl they knew and walked into the party with is talking to some American dude who barely speaks spanish. One thing leads to another and I hear my friend clearly tell both of these guys, one of whom is Lebanese and does understand English \"I'll beat the fuck out of both of you right now\". At this point the other friend who we crossed with and I hear this and approach all three of them trying to diffuse the situation. I pull my friend away from the group and tell him it's best if we go because we're guests in the house, we should avoid any fights and most importantly, we're not in the U.S., things can take a turn for the worst very quickly here in Tijuana and we don't know who these guys are or who they know. He agrees with me and we both start walking to the front gate to leave the house but it's locked.\n\n  \nIt's here that things become challenging because our other friend who was trying to stop the scuffle pulls up and tells us he's really fucking pissed and we need to leave asap. At this point the Lebanese dude pulls up on us at the front gate and continues to talk shit in both English and Spanish. At this point I'm genuinely assuming my friends are gonna put this guy to sleep but thankfully our mutual friend (the one who invited us) walks in with his neighbor to open the gate for us. As soon as she opens the gate I drag both of my American friends out and we start walking to our TJ friend's house. While walking I realize that our TJ friend is not walking with us and he went back into the house with the hostess. I tell my friends that I'll go get him and be right back. Both of them disagree with me and say they also want to back into the party to put hands on the Lebanese guy and his friend for talking shit. I tell them we're not doing that and they're going to wait for me here in the street while I get our friend from the party. One of my friends (the only who was approached by both guys) starts walking back to the neighbor's house, at which point I grasp his shoulders push him back and tell him he's not getting past me. He looks at me a bit distraught and glances at our friend while simply taking a step back. I realize he won't want to try that again and our other friend says \"I'm going back in the party\" and takes a few steps forward. I side step into his path and tell him \"No you're not bro, ya'll aren't going back in that party\" at which point he declares \"Who's gonna stop me? Watch me just walk in the house right now\". It's here that I lose a bit of my composure, take my glasses off, toss them on the asphalt and tell him \"If you feel like fighting someone let's go, put your hands up, but you're not walking back into that party\" and continued \"Let's shoot the fade right here and be done and go home\". He steps back and looks at me with a face of surprise and disgust and tells me I'm tripping for not having his back and wanting to fight him.\n\n  \nAfter a small moment of silence and some loud stares they continue walking down the street in the direction of our friend's house.

        "body_html": "<div class=\"md\"><p>First time making a Reddit post but here goes.</p>\n\n<p>So my good friend from Tijuana had been having a hard time with a recent breakup and invited me (24 M) and a couple of guy friends from San Diego to come down to TJ and party at one of his neighbor&#39;s house for halloween. Little context, I was born and raised in Tijuana and have been moving back and forth between SD and TJ since 15-16 years old. Both of the friends who I crossed with to go to the party are also Mexican but were born in the U.S., barely speak spanish and seldom travel to TJ, if at all. </p>\n\n<p>We get to the party and start having a good time in our friend&#39;s neighbor&#39;s garage, my two friends are knocking it out of the park with some girls who barely speak english and I&#39;m making friends with some of the other people at the party, all regular. At some point I notice a couple of guys approaching one of my friends and telling him a couple of things in spanish that sound like regular TJ banter, something like &quot;Ay man you fucked up?&quot; &quot;Yeaaaah he&#39;s fucked up huh?&quot;. My friend wasn&#39;t more drunk than anyone else at the party and my suspicion is these guys were probably a bit jealous that this girl they knew and walked into the party with is talking to some American dude who barely speaks spanish. One thing leads to another and I hear my friend clearly tell both of these guys, one of whom is Lebanese and does understand English &quot;I&#39;ll beat the fuck out of both of you right now&quot;. At this point the other friend who we crossed with and I hear this and approach all three of them trying to diffuse the situation. I pull my friend away from the group and tell him it&#39;s best if we go because we&#39;re guests in the house, we should avoid any fights and most importantly, we&#39;re not in the U.S., things can take a turn for the worst very quickly here in Tijuana and we don&#39;t know who these guys are or who they know. He agrees with me and we both start walking to the front gate to leave the house but it&#39;s locked.</p>\n\n<p>It&#39;s here that things become challenging because our other friend who was trying to stop the scuffle pulls up and tells us he&#39;s really fucking pissed and we need to leave asap. At this point the Lebanese dude pulls up on us at the front gate and continues to talk shit in both English and Spanish. At this point I&#39;m genuinely assuming my friends are gonna put this guy to sleep but thankfully our mutual friend (the one who invited us) walks in with his neighbor to open the gate for us. As soon as she opens the gate I drag both of my American friends out and we start walking to our TJ friend&#39;s house. While walking I realize that our TJ friend is not walking with us and he went back into the house with the hostess. I tell my friends that I&#39;ll go get him and be right back. Both of them disagree with me and say they also want to back into the party to put hands on the Lebanese guy and his friend for talking shit. I tell them we&#39;re not doing that and they&#39;re going to wait for me here in the street while I get our friend from the party. One of my friends (the only who was approached by both guys) starts walking back to the neighbor&#39;s house, at which point I grasp his shoulders push him back and tell him he&#39;s not getting past me. He looks at me a bit distraught and glances at our friend while simply taking a step back. I realize he won&#39;t want to try that again and our other friend says &quot;I&#39;m going back in the party&quot; and takes a few steps forward. I side step into his path and tell him &quot;No you&#39;re not bro, ya&#39;ll aren&#39;t going back in that party&quot; at which point he declares &quot;Who&#39;s gonna stop me? Watch me just walk in the house right now&quot;. It&#39;s here that I lose a bit of my composure, take my glasses off, toss them on the asphalt and tell him &quot;If you feel like fighting someone let&#39;s go, put your hands up, but you&#39;re not walking back into that party&quot; and continued &quot;Let&#39;s shoot the fade right here and be done and go home&quot;. He steps back and looks at me with a face of surprise and disgust and tells me I&#39;m tripping for not having his back and wanting to fight him.</p>\n\n<p>After a small moment of silence and some loud stares they continue walking down the street in the direction of our friend&#39;s house. I went back to the party and got our friend back and called it a night. Now he&#39;s gone and told the whole wider friend group that I tripped on him and our other friend and that I&#39;m a bitch for not letting him fight some people at a party in TJ and has been portraying me as the bad guy for threatening him. I don&#39;t think I&#39;m the asshole but I want to see what reddit thinks. </p>\n\n<p>If you read through all this mumbo jumbo thank you!</p>\n</div>",

The first session at my grandparents\u2019 house was fun, but the next one at my aunt\u2019s house took a turn. As soon as I arrived, my aunt and uncle were cold to me. During dinner, C1 invited me to eat, and I thanked them, but my uncle accused me of being rude to C1, even though I\u2019d shown nothing but gratitude. When I tried to leave the table to avoid an argument, he grabbed my arm and yelled, \u201cI\u2019ll put you in your place!\u201d  \n\nTrying to stay calm, I said, \u201cPlease let go of my arm.

My fiance has been friends with Jake since they were in middle school and I became pretty close with his girlfriend. Anyways cut to the chase they found out they were pregnant and they didn\u2019t live in the best household to raise a kid. (Fleas, mold, roaches, broken ac/ heat) so we offered to get a place with them and help them out. When we all found a place we really liked we all agreed to pay a certain amount and Cassie didn\u2019t have a job but said she would have one by move in date. (My first mistake). My fiance and I put our names on the lease and they moved into the apartment with us. The rent is 1650 (included a brand new washer and dryer, valet trash all that fun stuff). We have WiFi which is $50 a month and electricity bill which isn\u2019t a fixed rate. We agreed to all pay 450 plus throw in for groceries.\n\nWhen we moved in Cassie still didn\u2019t have a job and just layed around all day, which is fine bc she\u2019s pregnant. However once it started to become an issue when my fiance and I paid for all the groceries and household items. We bought the couch, tv, and everything needed for the living room. It got to the point where we paid 2100 for everything in the first month (including our rent) and bills. They agreed to just send 800 to cover their rent which we would still be covering a little of theirs plus WiFi. However we got a bill for electricity that was way higher and asked for $50 extra to help us pay it. They stated we were taking advantage of them and everyone thinks so bc they have to pay $800 for themselves (we paid the other $850 and every grocery in the house) but they don\u2019t cook so they depended on me to cook for everyone. Once we got onto our 4th grocery haul I stopped buying snacks because I could never get them. They were always brought to their room and I wasn\u2019t being sent any money for the grocers and they stated they only needed to truely pay for $600 a month in rent and the extra $200 was for groceries and bills. However if it was then it would only pay for 1/4 of the cost of groceries that month. And none of bills or half of bills and none of groceries. \n\nThey also continued having someone over while we weren\u2019t home who tried causing my fiance and I to break up and talked very disrespectfully about me saying horrible lies. My fiance and I make a decent living and DoorDash as date nights for extra money and bring in about 1500 a week. At first the extra payments weren\u2019t terrible bc we thought it would get better. Then they kept going out for dinner and buying things they didn\u2019t need but saying how they couldn\u2019t pay the rest of rent on time. \n\nThey moved out and had the friend who said all that stuff move their stuff out and told us how we took advantage of them and their situation but I don\u2019t see how as we paid for way more and tried to take care of them.

We\u2019ve had the same argument on a topic for 8 whole months and I trust people too much and trusted people telling me I\u2019m crazy for having allegations of cheating and etc. Since she kept giving me false promises about how much she loved me that she could see a future with us and have kids and etc. I held on because I know I had issues too with avoiding her sometimes because of my addiction getting worse each time just thinking about getting cheated on by her is devastating cause I\u2019ve had it done before with another ex. Going through months of this issue I lost sleep and my job and mental health. Having people that isolated me because of my allegations made me feel like I couldn\u2019t open up to anyone anymore. But I just got over it and opened up the other friends that weren\u2019t as close to me about my situation, but even then I didn\u2019t really get much of any validation and I just felt like I was going crazy. Seeing a bunch of content that were similar to my life story and timeline, it made me question if someone was just being around me to get info to have a \u201cstory\u201d and the stories were similar with our arguments and issues, but the stories were swapped and made me a \u201cnarcissist\u201d and a \u201ccheater\u201d that didn\u2019t know how to communicate and express my emotions and how I was controlling and insecure. Literally that\u2019s what she was, and it\u2019s just sad seeing everyone taking that side of the story. Made me felt like the bad guy that everyone hated and thought was an asshole. I later realized that my phone has been hacked and mirrored, or sim swapped or dual sim, because there\u2019s time that my phone glitches and my screen literally changes, and sometimes control some actions on my phone. Honestly been feeling like I\u2019ve been puppeteered to think of things and to see things to control a \u201cnarrative\u201d later I find out about shadow banning and cloaking that doesn\u2019t allow me to send messages and doesn\u2019t allow people to see my messages. Been listening to a podcast called \u201cthis is actually happening\u201d and a specific episode titled \u201cwhat if they\u2019re delighted in your demise\u201d it gave me some more insight that i was part of a smear campaign. It trips me out because I don\u2019t know who\u2019s behind it, and my phone shows me content that could make me believe it to be certain people, but I feel like it could just be showing me things to falsely blame others. But obviously I don\u2019t want to hurt people I care for, but since I know I have haters, it makes me try to find out what I need to do to protect myself from identity theft and etc. Seeing content about me not \u201cresponding\u201d to messages or whatever made me feel like there must\u2019ve been a lot of things hidden from me because I wasn\u2019t getting responses from people and ai manipulation could copy voices and face features made me not trust anyone even more. My emotions were more torn in real life and didn\u2019t worry much about content cause I know there can be fake content with just a bunch of bots. But yeah really just annoyed that my phone is hacked and it feel\u2019s personal since no one really responds to me.",

I live in Montana and I was helping them out by giving them a place to rest while they try to save up some money to get their own place. Over the course of a full month, from July 2, 2024 to August 2, 2024, the two would argue nearly every single day, whether at work or inside my apartment during the sound ordinance. As I'm living in an apartment, that causes me a lot of issues and worry since that could potentially get me kicked out of my apartment at worse, ruining my hard work of owning the apartment for 2 months at the time. Due to my rough upbringing in life, I ABSOLUTELY LOATHE arguments in the household, which was ruining my already messed up sleep schedule even more. I would consider myself a very patient guy, but hearing them argue the entire time and waking up to it really pissed me off, but I managed to control myself and went to get something to drink. As I returned to my bedroom, I slammed my door because I was pissed, and that's how I was letting them know I was pissed. Apparently, I can't slam my own door because the male, calling him Asshole, decides to open my bedroom door and say these exact words: \"What the fuck is your problem?!\" I stared at him for a moment before yelling and going off on him about how they were interrupting my sleep with their arguments and acting like children, they're at least 5-15 years older than I am, and he decides to try to push me back. I then forced him back, me holding him by the throat, and slammed him against my wall on the other side of my apartment. I then yelled at both of them to pack their crap and get the fuck out of my apartment. I then went over to one of my neighbors, who's also like family and calling him Awesome bro and white, and explained to him what happened while pacing angrily in his apartment. After a bit, I asked Awesome bro to join me in going back to my apartment to ensure Asshole doesn't do anything to my apartment, and upon returning to my apartment I see the police standing outside my apartment as well as my landlord. It had me even more pissed and angry as well as worried that I'm losing my apartment, but my landlord assured me I wasn't in any trouble and I'm good. I explained everything to an officer to the best of my ability while still very angry, though the officer was quite understanding. Once they we're all gone, I was finally able to fall asleep peacefully, and this all happened at 3 am. I'm very new to the app",

Apparently, I can&#39;t slam my own door because the male, calling him Asshole, decides to open my bedroom door and say these exact words: &quot;What the fuck is your problem?!&quot; I stared at him for a moment before yelling and going off on him about how they were interrupting my sleep with their arguments and acting like children, they&#39;re at least 5-15 years older than I am, and he decides to try to push me back. I then forced him back, me holding him by the throat, and slammed him against my wall on the other side of my apartment. I then yelled at both of them to pack their crap and get the fuck out of my apartment. I then went over to one of my neighbors, who&#39;s also like family and calling him Awesome bro and white, and explained to him what happened while pacing angrily in his apartment. After a bit, I asked Awesome bro to join me in going back to my apartment to ensure Asshole doesn&#39;t do anything to my apartment, and upon returning to my apartment I see the police standing outside my apartment as well as my landlord. It had me even more pissed and angry as well as worried that I&#39;m losing my apartment, but my landlord assured me I wasn&#39;t in any trouble and I&#39;m good. I explained everything to an officer to the best of my ability while still very angry, though the officer was quite understanding. Once they we&#39;re all gone, I was finally able to fall asleep peacefully, and this all happened at 3 am. I&#39;m very new to the app</p>\n</div>",

BEFORE she even called an ambulance. she was more worried about letting every one know so they would give HER sympathy and fuck whatever that poor girl was feeling. (that's another reason i can't stand her, she always has to have drama and she always spins it so that SHE gets the attention and the \"omg poor you\" bs) \n\nso anyways, we ran into them at DQ last summer (her, her husband and their 2 kids they have together 2boys like 7 & 5 i think) and i was sitting there enjoying my blizzard and just kinda listening to them talk to my husband (because tbh, never liked her husband, either - he's a year older than me and i've known him since school, he's a grade A dumbass). so, they were talking to my husband and i heard them mention the girl, then they complained about her because she tried to kill herself and THEN called her \"a psycho cunt bitch\". i totally just death stared at them until they left. lemme be honest, i didn't say anything then, but that's only because 100% i would have went to jail. they know how i feel about what they said now and idgaf how they 'feel' about it. \n\nso, now thanksgiving is tomorrow and my husband said we should just invite her so she's \"not offended\". i told him idgaf is she's offended, and i hope she is. her and her husband bullied his child, her step child, for having a mental breakdown. instead of offering her love and support, they said they don't want her to come back from the treatment facility, not even for the holidays, they said as far as they cared, she could just stay there forever. instead of showing their child some fucking empathy (and yes she should consider his kids as her own her kids, but you can tell she favors her own over them and always has.) so, internet strangers, would you invite these people into your home, knowing what they said about a child (THEIR CHILD) that had a mental crisis? \n\n  \ntl/dr: sister in law and her husband called his child a \"psycho cunt bitch\" after she damn near killed herself, and didn't want her to go back to their house after she was out of the mental institution. i don't want to invite them for thanksgiving, because fuck them that's why.",

(that&#39;s another reason i can&#39;t stand her, she always has to have drama and she always spins it so that SHE gets the attention and the &quot;omg poor you&quot; bs) </p>\n\n<p>so anyways, we ran into them at DQ last summer (her, her husband and their 2 kids they have together 2boys like 7 &amp; 5 i think) and i was sitting there enjoying my blizzard and just kinda listening to them talk to my husband (because tbh, never liked her husband, either - he&#39;s a year older than me and i&#39;ve known him since school, he&#39;s a grade A dumbass). so, they were talking to my husband and i heard them mention the girl, then they complained about her because she tried to kill herself and THEN called her &quot;a psycho cunt bitch&quot;. i totally just death stared at them until they left. lemme be honest, i didn&#39;t say anything then, but that&#39;s only because 100% i would have went to jail. they know how i feel about what they said now and idgaf how they &#39;feel&#39; about it. </p>\n\n<p>so, now thanksgiving is tomorrow and my husband said we should just invite her so she&#39;s &quot;not offended&quot;. i told him idgaf is she&#39;s offended, and i hope she is. her and her husband bullied his child, her step child, for having a mental breakdown. instead of offering her love and support, they said they don&#39;t want her to come back from the treatment facility, not even for the holidays, they said as far as they cared, she could just stay there forever. instead of showing their child some fucking empathy (and yes she should consider his kids as her own her kids, but you can tell she favors her own over them and always has.) so, internet strangers, would you invite these people into your home, knowing what they said about a child (THEIR CHILD) that had a mental crisis? </p>\n\n<p>tl/dr: sister in law and her husband called his child a &quot;psycho cunt bitch&quot; after she damn near killed herself, and didn&#39;t want her to go back to their house after she was out of the mental institution. i don&#39;t want to invite them for thanksgiving, because fuck them that&#39;s why.</p>\n</div>",

How do you get a 73 year old stubborn man to stop eating your child's food and sweets and even your own food, especially when he gets more than his fair share and eats way more than anyone in this household? I'm allergic to eggs and gluten. My diet is limited and he has the audacity to eat even my special foods that is all I can eat without an allergic reaction. Talking hasn't worked, asking hasn't worked. I have even set one drawerbin the fridge just fir our stuff, told him it's our stuff. If we put our left overs in the fridge to eat later that day or the next day, he will literally go and eat it out of our dishes in the fridge and just leave the empty dish inside. He is a glutton. He will finish 4 loafs of bread on his own in 2 days. 1 2ltr tub of ice cream in 20 minutes on his own, 1 kg stork margerine in a week. 1 kg syrup in a week. 750g ricoffy in 2 weeks, 2 kg sygar in 1 week all on his own, 1 pocket of potatoes in less than 2 weeks etc on his own! I am at my witts end. I can't even afford a second hand fridge to keep in my room just so he can leave our stuff alone. We eat once a day. Sometimes we even have just popcorn for dinner while he eats eggs, bread, tomatoes etc multiple times a day. When his 4 loafs of bread was finished, he stole my Rye bread and ate it. I am constantly stressed that he is going to eat my child's food. I am truly disgusted at his behavior and gluttony. We try our best to stretch meals and make everything last, while he just goes crazy finishing everything off like A stray dog that hasn't fed in months.he will finish all of his and then take ours as well. The last 2 weeks of the month there is no money and no food left. Food and money lasts only 2 weeks in this house because of him.
