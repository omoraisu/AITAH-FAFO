      "selftext": "All of the names have been changed and ages will be changed although close to actual ages. \n\nSo I (14 female) take drama at school. We\u2019ve recently decided to put on a parody of The Wizard of Oz. It\u2019s basically about a group of students attempting to put on The Wizard of Oz, but everything starts going wrong. I think the play is pretty funny actually and will be fun to put on, maybe scary though because it\u2019ll be my first time performing in front of an actual audience that\u2019s not my classmates. Along with performing The Wizard of Oz parody, we\u2019re also doing Anne Frank, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s relevant to the story. Anyways, our drama teacher gave us a sheet to fill out on what characters we would not want to be under any circumstances and our top three choices on what we wanted to be. For TWO (I\u2019m shortening The Wizard of Oz to this), I put that I wanted to be 3 more minor roles in the play as I have some stage fright and don\u2019t want to have a major role. I put that I didn\u2019t want to be Dorothy, Wicked Witch, and so on. When our drama teacher announced what roles we got one by one by writing on a whiteboard, I\u2019d gotten Scarecrow. For context, Scarecrow is a pretty major role in the play with it being kind of a deuteragonist role. The Scarecrow in the play is basically a boy who thinks all plays are musicals and didn\u2019t know that a play could not be a musical, so he studied the script for the musical version of TWO. The boy just randomly bursts into song as Scarecrow a bunch and is pretty funny. I did not want this role though because it is a more major role and I had chosen smaller roles for the ones I wanted to play on the sheet. I did not explicitly put that I didn\u2019t want to be Scarecrow on the audition sheet though so I was relatively fine with it although I was a little disappointed and I probably looked like it too. \n\nAfter my role was revealed, the girl next to me, let\u2019s call her Pamela, was staring at me quite a bit. I was a little put off by that, but mostly ignored it. I\u2019d didn\u2019t realize at the time why she was staring at me. Now, there\u2019s going to be a time skip to a day later, on Saturday. I had a birthday party that day that I was going to attend and at the birthday parties, a friend of mine who was close to Pamela told me something. She said that Pamela hated our drama teacher and apparently me now. Basically, Pamela had emailed the drama teacher after we had already filled out our audition sheets and said that she didn\u2019t want to be a certain character. I don\u2019t know if she put that character as one of the characters in the play she wanted to be or maybe she forgot to put that role as a character she really didn\u2019t want to be though. Anyways, she emailed the drama teacher and the drama teacher still cast her as that specific role, this might be because he head already decided the roles and didn\u2019t want to change them or he didn\u2019t see her email, I honestly don\u2019t know. My friend (well we\u2019ve been having issues and I honestly don\u2019t know if I want to be friends with her anymore) then said that Pamela hates me too because I looked disappointed and apparently let out an, \u201cAw,\u201d at getting a major role (I don\u2019t know if I did this, but maybe I did?). The friend(?) said that Pamela was angry at this and felt I was being ungrateful and said I hadn\u2019t even auditioned for Scarecrow and I got it. I actually did audition for Scarecrow and the drama teacher said he\u2019d cast me because of how I was the only one who actually sang for the audition and that it was funny.\n\n I asked if Pamela actually hated me and wasn\u2019t just angry at me and my friend(?) said that Pamela hated me. Another friend at the table said to ignore Pamela and that she was kinda erratic and she really didn\u2019t like Pamela. I\u2019m kinda worried though. I feel like my friend(?), let\u2019s call her Amy, who told me about what Pamela said kinda agreed with Pamela about how I was being ungrateful for being disappointed at getting that role because of the way she told me about what Pamela said. I don\u2019t know if I want to be friends with this friend anymore, but for some reason her opinion still matters to me since I\u2019ve been friends with her for a very long time, much longer than I\u2019ve known my other friends for. I\u2019m just worried that I\u2019m actually wrong and this situation and that even if I\u2019m not wrong, it\u2019ll be very awkward in drama class between me and Pamela and maybe she\u2019ll target me.\n\n Also, before you ask why I\u2019m even friends with Amy, Amy\u2019s kinda popular in school and she also always talks about me to her friends from what I\u2019ve observed. I used to be a huge over-sharer when I was younger too, so Amy knows basically all my secrets even though I don\u2019t think I know all of hers. I might make a separate post on this to ask for advice because I know I\u2019m doing bad things in that toxic friendship too. I know this is a pretty childish thing to post about and I really shouldn\u2019t even be on Reddit at my age and might get bashed for being on Reddit and writing this, but I\u2019m just really worried about this. Also, sorry for writing so much. Hopefully no one I know will find this because the play and role I got is the same.\n\nTLDR: I got a major role I didn\u2019t want in a play because I have some stage fright and wanted a small role. Now a girl hates me because I was acting ungrateful by looking disappointed. My friend(?) who\u2019s gotten really close to her lately probably also agrees with her so that\u2019s another reason I posted here. ",
