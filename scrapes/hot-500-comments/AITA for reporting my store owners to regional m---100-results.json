      "selftext": "Hi. I'm a 33F working as a server at a nicer kind of restaurant. \n\nI have only been with the place for going on 4mo. I left my former job that I was managing because it was a dead end job and I didn't have realistic promotional options nor means to increase my hourly salary outside of annual raises. In addition to it being a dead end opportunity, the upper management of this place frequently liked to change/break rules and labor laws. After 3 years of dealing with it because I felt like I had to, I finally left. \n\nI figured a serving job would be lucrative and less stressful than managing a large department but I have stumbled onto a barely functioning place and I feel like it's time to find a new job already. \n\nLong story short these owners are new and have no idea what it takes to run a restaurant. We run out of small wares menus and every kind of glass we have. They overbook parties and understaff the kitchen and when they get bad reviews they blame the front of house staff. Don't get me started on the bug problem. \n\nMy very first check with them did not come until the following Tuesday. I had no idea that I'd get my check late and neither did anyone else. They told us it was ADPs fault and everyday they said that our money would be there by end of day. I was told Sunday at the latest. The said they were dealing w ADP since Wednesday to \"resolve \" the problem and I asked why they didn't actually make us aware there was potentially a problem. I had gone home Thursday night and used my tip money to cover bills and figured the bills coming out over the weekend would be fine since I had a paycheck coming. As I said no one got paid til Tuesday. \n\nI told them then that this was incredibly inappropriate I've worked many jobs in two countries and adp has never failed. I knew they submitted late they just wouldn't admit it and were mad at me and others for being mad about not being paid. I worked my Friday Saturday and Sunday shifts and called in Monday Tuesday as I hadn't been paid yet. Wednesday when I came in was a bad shift as well as we ran out of everything from chicken to steaks and so much more. \n\nMonths later and this past Friday we woke up and there was nothing in our accounts yet again. Staff had told me last time that this had happened many times already (6+) and I was like absolutely not how do they get away with that. \n\nSo when we woke up unpaid I called the head office and left a voice mail and also emailed corporate about it. I then went to my Friday shift after stating I wasn't coming in. Our GM who is new convinced me to come in as he said he is doing all he can to look into things. The owners told him it was ADP again. I told him how things went last time. Needless today he wasn't happy. \n\nApparently the owners (25m,24f) were over heard discussing how they wanted to retaliate against me and cut my section, take shifts, etc. GM told him not to do anything because I was iin the right and the labor board would also think so. I come for my shift and GM cuts me a 4booth section and our 12person party room with two parties scheduled for the night. Gm asks me to put my best face forward and steer clear of them. I agree and said I would. Before my party was over I noticed someone greeting a table in my section. I checked the board and she cut my section by 2 booths. I have my second party in about 30 minutes so I think ok 2 booths and I can focus on my party. I bus the first and set the second one up all by myself in less than 30, scavenging for cutlery and menus since we are so short on them. I come around at 640, no party and menus taken. Host and GM are confused. The owner cut my section and took my second party away. I was furious. \n\nI asked GM to cut me shortly after (like 7pm) because I was not sticking around. \n\nOur regional manager called me on Friday and I was driving and unable to take the call. Since I decided to attend my shift I didn't call back until sat. I told him everything going on from the bug problems and their lies about ADP. Regional was able to confirm that payroll was sent late. I said they won't take responsibility and are mad at me for not wanting to punch a clock that doesn't pay me and this is the second time and employees (many bring students) have said it's happened more. They scale back out KMs hours in the system, take tipout for themselves and do not actually distribute tip out fairly to all the people entitled to it. They blame us everytime something goes wrong. I have tried to calmly discuss some issues with them, which they start talking over me, denying and going off and belittling me. And of course about her retaliating after being told not to.\n\nI took Saturday off because I am so anxious and upset I am throwing up. \n\nI have a double today and i am feeling my anxiety symptoms through the roof. I take medication for my anxiety as well. \n\nMy brain is attacking me saying I am a bad person for reporting everything and going in on them. I also want to go to the labor board after a conversation with the fm owner just basically going off on me when I told her I was taking Saturday as per my therapists guidance when my symptoms are getting bad. I told her that I spoke to RM so he knows why I was missing shift and I did so because I anticipate her retaliating and that was my way of telling her that i have already reached out to higher channels. \n\nAll the FOH staff agrees and has wanted to take some kind of action but feel they may lose their source of income in the process and being that the majority of them are literally college students, they don't really understand their rights and if we don't fight to have our paycheck on time ii don't know what the world's come to. \n\nThey paid us by Friday end of day but the last time, as I said, money came Tuesday and none of us believed that it would come through on Friday at all but I am not patting them on the back. We had 19 hours where we should have been paid and weren't and didn't know when we would for sure. They still paid us late. \n\nI just want the nagging \"YOUVE DONE SOMETHING WRONG'\" feeling to subside. \n\nSorry it's so long. ",
