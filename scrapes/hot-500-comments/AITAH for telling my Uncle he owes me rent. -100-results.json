      "selftext": "This is a bit of a long story, and I am unsure how to handle it. In 2021 my father died and 8 months later his mother, my grandmother passed also. My grandmother was really set financially, the house paid off, retirement, I am sure there was a will even though I am being told there was none. My grandmother only had 2 sons . My father had 3 kids, myself (40) being the eldest, my sister (39) and my brother(36), along with her second son my Uncle (65) who has no children and will not. My sister and I live a few states away from the rest of our family, my Grandmother lives in Fresno, CA. When my grandmother died, my uncle didn't tell anyone he posted it on FB, I found out from a family friend calling me to tell me she was sorry. Uncle would not answer the phone to anyone and would not talk to us for over a week after she died, when he did it was to tell my sister and me we needed to get to her house if we wanted anything from her because he was selling the house and it all needed to go. So, we traveled to Fresno to get the few things he would let us have, like end tables, a couple of chairs, and a box of what he said was her jewelry. We opened it later on our way home and found that it was not her jewelry but most likely picked up from a thrift store. We were pretty mad, but we just let it go . We got a few things and luckily, I had gotten a few items of jewelry years before. My sister and I figured there was a will, and the house went to Uncle. Our uncle did not live with my grandmother in all the years she lived in that house, in 2022 he started remodeling the house and sent pics to my mother, late 2022 he moved in with his partner. He sent texts explaining that he decided not to sell but to move in and how much money was spent making it livable. It was a beautiful house, and he ruined it. The problem with this is I know he didn't have the money to remodel a house unless he was using his mother's retirement, before her death she got upset with Uncle because he used the money, she sent him to help pay rent to buy a puppy. Fast forward to 2023, I get court papers in the mail, the house is going through probate. I called Uncle to ask what was going on, and he says as his brother's kids we have to be notified about the change of ownership, here's the kicker on the paperwork, my brother is not on it, and they have my name wrong. I let Uncle know all this and he was like it's not a big deal you guys are just there as family members. Ok, whatever, I probably would have been nosier and more found out as much as I could at that time if I hadn't had so much going on in my life at that time. For the next year we hear nothing again, don't really think much of it, probably all done and over with. It's not,  mid-Oct this year I got a call from Uncle again, well it seems in the state of CA all the hires have to be in the house, him with half because he was her son and the 3 grandkids splitting the other half, which would have been my father's half. Now he is saying the house is part of our inheritance, but he needs us to sign off on the house. Giving up our part is, by doing this the taxes would be the same and would not go up to 20,000 dollars a year and he wouldn't want us to have to pay that for the house because it's in our name. Also, as his only living family, the house would go to us kids when he dies because we are his heirs. That attorney wanted another $15,000 put in an escrow account to keep going in court, that they are fighting, and his attorney thinks that the house should just be sold. Uncle told me to call his attorney if I had questions and get the paperwork to sign off. I told him I would think about it, do some research and get back to him. I did a bit I know my grandmother bought the house in 1998 for $68,000, a steal, it was reassessed at $98,00. Fresno property tax is 1.37% which makes it about $1,500 a year. How did he get $20,000? It's possible that the property tax in Fresno County to jump to 5.0% which is only $5,000 a year. Still not $20,000 but the law says the house has to be reassessed when changing ownership, which would put it closer to $300,000 and 5% of that is $15,000 a year with homeowners' insurance $20,000 makes sense. I looked into the law it says that the only way for the house not to have a reassessment is to go to the child of the owner and it has to be the child's permanent resident. It was not my uncle's permanent residence until 6 months to a year after she passed away, I am pretty sure that makes it still have to go through reassessment even if all 3 of the grandkids sign off. It's been a few weeks, and I really did nothing because I am busy and out of sight, out of mind for me sadly. So I got a text asking me if I was going to sign off like my brother and sister ( my sister is not so I have no clue where that came from ) I told him I had been trying to get a hold of his attorney but he wouldn't call me back, which I have and he hasn't because I wanted to make an informed decision. After that, he went on a whole tirade that he didn't want me messing up his case this late and didn't want me asking his attorney questions and bringing up stuff and how his mother wanted him to have the house. If I was going to push this, he expected a check for $10,000 for the past 2 years of proprty  taxes. I said since you lived in the house rent-free for 2 years, we should fix that also, rent in that area is about $2,000 a month but his family and we will give him a brake so $1,700, x 24 is $40,800. Take away property taxes he paid ( from my grandmother's money no less but I'll give him that) so $35,000 half that is $17,900 divided by 3 is about $6,000 so he should probably have a check in the mail to myself, sister, and brother for that. What I know is that there are things that could happen if we do sign off, we sign off and he dies the next day and we have to go through the next 3 years of probate like he just did, and that even if he willed it to us. Or he sells the house in which we get nothing because we signed off, or he adds his partner to the house and when he dies it goes to whoever he puts on the house, and we still get nothing. I don't want to kick him out, what I want is reassurance that the house will go to the 3 grandkids after he dies, he will not sell it, and if he does it split as it should be half to him and half split 3 ways to the grandkids. He is not in good health and my grandmother worried that the state would come to take the house if it ever went in his name because he has so many states medical bills.  We are not talking now; I am calling a probate attorney in Fresno tomorrow. Also, my name is still wrong on that paperwork, but they did finally add my brothers.",
