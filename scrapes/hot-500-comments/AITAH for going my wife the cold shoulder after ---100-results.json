      "selftext": "Me(26M) and my wife (44F) were heading to church. On our way we stop and get a cup of coffee. The new girl says \u201cOh hey it is you guys\u201d . She remembers us from the week before which always surprises me when things like that happen. Now this kind of thing happens a lot. If it is at the super market or a restaurant,church\u2026 i later ask my wife \u201c I wonder why people always remember us so easily\u201d her response was a sigh followed with \u201cbaby you aren\u2019t anything special\u201d\nI stop walking with a shocked look on my face and you can tell she knew she shouldn\u2019t have. said something like that. \n\nNow she has been super apologetic and trying to say she didn\u2019t mean it. Just not sure how to feel. If that is her actual feelings or what\n\n\nTo give a little more detail my wife is 18 years older than me. We both are pretty good looking and you cant tell the age difference. I am a white guy and she is from Mexico. ",
