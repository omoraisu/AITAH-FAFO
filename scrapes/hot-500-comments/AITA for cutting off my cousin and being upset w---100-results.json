      "selftext": "my extended family and i have a tradition of coming together in the thanksgiving week and exchanging gifts with each other as we usually dont see each other during christmas and new years. this year, ive been getting into some knitting, and so i knit everybody in the family a sweater. i thought it turned out pretty good. also, some more background is that we meet one day, give our gifts, and we all take a break another day, and then the next day is board game night.\n\ncome to the day we meet, i hand it out to everybody, and they all thank me. i note however, that my cousin was glaring at the sweater, and later carelessly stuffed the sweater into his backpack, which was already full, and i wouldnt be surprised if some of the stitches came off. i would have let this go, but what comes after really pissed me off. the second day, the day of the board games, i walk into our relatives house and see his DOG WEARING THE SWEATER. i immediately went up to him and confronted him about it, and he just said that it looked too perfect for the dog. also this cousin is very stubborn, so i knew i couldnt do anything.\n\nso later, i go talk to my family about it, AND THEY SIDE WITH HIM. they say that i should be happy that the sweater is still being 'appreciated.'\n\nso now i dont know, am i the ah? i originally thought he was wrong, now im not so sure...any advice would help thanks.",
