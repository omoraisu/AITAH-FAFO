One case resulted in a large verdict we received this year. The other case resulted in a large settlement this year. \\n\\nI have been contemplating what to do with the bonus. I decided that I would pay off my house, take 90% of the remainder and save it, and then give my mom 10% of the remainder. My fianc\\u00e9e asked me how much I planned to give her family. I do not plan on giving them any of it. As I see it, this is a way for me to pay back my mom for all the sacrifices she made for my education. And it is that education that allowed me to get this bonus. To say my fianc\\u00e9e is pissed is an understatement. She says I am being selfish. I do not see it that way at all. Her parents did not contribute to my ability to get this bonus, so not sure why they should receive the benefit of it.  \\n\\nAITA?\\n\\n[Note: We share finances for our salary, but any type of bonus is generally spent as we each see fit.

I was planning on staying with her until she could find out what to do. Then Tavion came back out of the blue last week. After two months or probably more away. I was furious. I still am furious. Me and my sisters had a birthday party for my nephew who is now 7 years old. I didn't speak to him the whole time I was there. \\n\\nI talked to my two other sisters Natalie and Kaylynn and I also played tag and hide and go seek with the kids outside. I talked to Kaylynn's boyfriend and Natalie's baby daddy but didn't talk to Tavion. He was very upset the whole day. I'm a very talkative person cause of my sucky childhood. I didn't even talk to my sister Samantha tbh. \\n\\nBefore they left Tavion asked me why I didn't talk to them but everyone else. I told him the truth that to me he abandoned their kids and left my sister. And to me you don't do that. Leaving my sister is whatever you want to do but to abandoned your kids is fucked up and we grew up with a dad who was in and out of our lives and still is. And we want more for our kids. He told me I don't understand what it's like to be a parent and I told him stright up that I help them with literally everything. \\n\\nThey need food? You call me.\\nThey need school supplies? You call me. \\nThey need anything from anywhere? You call me. \\n\\nHeck they all call me their second mother. He told me he needed a break. I told him stright up that what he did was abandoned his kids not take a week or even a weekend away but he stayed two months away that to me is not a break. I also asked him what about my sister Sam she doesn't get a break. He told me she doesn't need one. I called bullshit and then he told me he still counts me as a little sister and that he loves me as one. I told him he was honestly nothing to me except my sisters boyfriend. He got mad and called me an asshole. I called him a punk ass boy who needs to grow up and that you don't get a break from being a parent until all of them turn 18 or even 20. \\n\\nSam asked me to let it go since she did. I told her just cause you let it go didn't mean I have to. That he abandoned his kids and that's something I can never forget. I told Tavion that he won't ever be my brother again. And he got upset. I told my sisters if they ever need a break to bring them to my house for the weekend and I'll take care of them until Sunday night but to not abandon their kids. And that goes to their boyfriends aswell.\\n\\nSo am I the asshole for telling my sisters boyfriend that he isn't my brother anymore after he abandoned his kids?\\n\",\n          \"hi im 21F, living at home with parents. i recently upgraded from a regular pc to a gaming pc. the old one was a fairly good hp pc that was running well, about 4 years old, and originally costed around $550. i upgraded to a gaming pc because i have saved up and want to play heavier games. my mom said that i give the old pc to my 9 and 10 year old nieces. i kind of got frustrated because i feel like it's not just a hand-me-down, and it wasn't cheap. they are also kids that i honestly don't trust to use and keep it in good condition. \\n\\non the other hand, i do feel kind of mean for not giving it to them even though i am literally not using it. i did not directly tell my mom i don't want to give it to them, but i feel obligated to now. AITAH?\",\n          \"Basically they've conversed maybe a total of 8 times in the past 18 months, each time about mutual friends (a friend passed away), a picture of the animal they owned together and a hi or bye. He usually stops answering first but this last time made me feel much worse than I had already felt (which BTW was pretty fuckin bad).\\n\\nThey texted about the animal briefly and for the first time I've seen, he asked her how she's been. Asked and answered, truly very generic and distant interaction. \\n\\nHowever, she then asked him if he's still dating me lol. To which he didn't respond :) \\n\\nJust to get ahead of this- I have no idea why I haven't left him. I hesitate to say this cause it sounds dumb coming after what I just said but we have an incredible relationship other than this fucking issue. \\n\\nThey were together for maybe 3 1/2 years and separated a year or so when I met him and she's moved away. The first time or two I found out they had texted was a few months into our relationship and then maybe a month or two again after. I confronted him and he promised he blocked her. Since then I've found him texting her three times and I haven't said anything because it feels pointless. \\n\\nWe live together and have been staying with eachother since a month or two after we met. The time I confronted him I packed all my stuff at his house and nearly ended the relationship. Which is why I guess he swore he'd blocked her although I guess he didn't. But I stayed. And he's done it again. And this time hurts so fucking bad because we'll why was that the conversation ender for him. \\n\\nThese texts are so innocent that it's making me feel fucking insane and I dont have an ex of that long who I was in such a serious relationship with so idk if it's normal or if I am justified for feeling a growing sense of resentment against him. \\n\\nHow do you feel about the idea of a significant other texting their ex like this? Can it really be innocent or is it always a bad sign?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"aitah_tag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

I was planning on staying with her until she could find out what to do. Then Tavion came back out of the blue last week. After two months or probably more away. I was furious. I still am furious. Me and my sisters had a birthday party for my nephew who is now 7 years old. I didn't speak to him the whole time I was there. \\n\\nI talked to my two other sisters Natalie and Kaylynn and I also played tag and hide and go seek with the kids outside. I talked to Kaylynn's boyfriend and Natalie's baby daddy but didn't talk to Tavion. He was very upset the whole day. I'm a very talkative person cause of my sucky childhood. I didn't even talk to my sister Samantha tbh. \\n\\nBefore they left Tavion asked me why I didn't talk to them but everyone else. I told him the truth that to me he abandoned their kids and left my sister. And to me you don't do that. Leaving my sister is whatever you want to do but to abandoned your kids is fucked up and we grew up with a dad who was in and out of our lives and still is. And we want more for our kids. He told me I don't understand what it's like to be a parent and I told him stright up that I help them with literally everything. \\n\\nThey need food? You call me.\\nThey need school supplies? You call me. \\nThey need anything from anywhere? You call me. \\n\\nHeck they all call me their second mother. He told me he needed a break. I told him stright up that what he did was abandoned his kids not take a week or even a weekend away but he stayed two months away that to me is not a break. I also asked him what about my sister Sam she doesn't get a break. He told me she doesn't need one. I called bullshit and then he told me he still counts me as a little sister and that he loves me as one. I told him he was honestly nothing to me except my sisters boyfriend. He got mad and called me an asshole. I called him a punk ass boy who needs to grow up and that you don't get a break from being a parent until all of them turn 18 or even 20. \\n\\nSam asked me to let it go since she did. I told her just cause you let it go didn't mean I have to. That he abandoned his kids and that's something I can never forget. I told Tavion that he won't ever be my brother again. And he got upset. I told my sisters if they ever need a break to bring them to my house for the weekend and I'll take care of them until Sunday night but to not abandon their kids. And that goes to their boyfriends aswell.\\n\\nSo am I the asshole for telling my sisters boyfriend that he isn't my brother anymore after he abandoned his kids?\\n\",\n          \"hi im 21F, living at home with parents. i recently upgraded from a regular pc to a gaming pc. the old one was a fairly good hp pc that was running well, about 4 years old, and originally costed around $550. i upgraded to a gaming pc because i have saved up and want to play heavier games. my mom said that i give the old pc to my 9 and 10 year old nieces. i kind of got frustrated because i feel like it's not just a hand-me-down, and it wasn't cheap. they are also kids that i honestly don't trust to use and keep it in good condition. \\n\\non the other hand, i do feel kind of mean for not giving it to them even though i am literally not using it. i did not directly tell my mom i don't want to give it to them, but i feel obligated to now. AITAH?\",\n          \"Basically they've conversed maybe a total of 8 times in the past 18 months, each time about mutual friends (a friend passed away), a picture of the animal they owned together and a hi or bye. He usually stops answering first but this last time made me feel much worse than I had already felt (which BTW was pretty fuckin bad).\\n\\nThey texted about the animal briefly and for the first time I've seen, he asked her how she's been. Asked and answered, truly very generic and distant interaction. \\n\\nHowever, she then asked him if he's still dating me lol. To which he didn't respond :) \\n\\nJust to get ahead of this- I have no idea why I haven't left him. I hesitate to say this cause it sounds dumb coming after what I just said but we have an incredible relationship other than this fucking issue. \\n\\nThey were together for maybe 3 1/2 years and separated a year or so when I met him and she's moved away. The first time or two I found out they had texted was a few months into our relationship and then maybe a month or two again after. I confronted him and he promised he blocked her. Since then I've found him texting her three times and I haven't said anything because it feels pointless. \\n\\nWe live together and have been staying with eachother since a month or two after we met. The time I confronted him I packed all my stuff at his house and nearly ended the relationship. Which is why I guess he swore he'd blocked her although I guess he didn't. But I stayed. And he's done it again. And this time hurts so fucking bad because we'll why was that the conversation ender for him. \\n\\nThese texts are so innocent that it's making me feel fucking insane and I dont have an ex of that long who I was in such a serious relationship with so idk if it's normal or if I am justified for feeling a growing sense of resentment against him. \\n\\nHow do you feel about the idea of a significant other texting their ex like this? Can it really be innocent or is it always a bad sign?\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"aitah_tag\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 0,\n        \"min\": 0,\n        \"max\": 1,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 2,\n        \"samples\": [\n          1,\n          0\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"processed_selftext\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
